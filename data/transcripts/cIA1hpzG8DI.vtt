um we have two to handle uh House Bill
 
00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
1368 which is relative to recusable by
 
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
members of the general court for

UM

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how many people I think
 
00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 align:start position:0%
pretty much everyone understands the
 
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 align:start position:0%
process we have here we have only two
 
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.770 align:start position:0%
process we have here we have only two
items

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
items
 
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
um this is a binary choice of recommend
 
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
or not recommend for future legislation
 
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.210 align:start position:0%
or not recommend for future legislation
um

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
I'll just go in order and start with
 
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1368 relative to reusable by
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
members of the general court for
 
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest
 
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
I would be we are dealing only with the
 
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 align:start position:0%
concept here not with the the
 
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
actual bill itself and I'd be looking
 
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.330 align:start position:0%
actual bill itself and I'd be looking
for

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.710 align:start position:0%
for
a

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.909 align:start position:0%
a
motion

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace thank you Mr
 
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
chairman I recommend the bill for future
 
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.629 align:start position:0%
chairman I recommend the bill for future
legislation

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
they're a second
 
00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
I'll second it
 
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Sheehan you
 
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
have that
 
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
since you're a sponsor on the bill do
 
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
you would you like to well I do feel we
 
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 align:start position:0%
all right there's this big problem
 
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
there's been a big problem for a long
 
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
time in terms of when people should
 
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 align:start position:0%
recuse and not recuse and
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
um I really respect the fact that the
 
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
bill was brought in essentially by um
 
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
representative Ned Gordon initially the
 
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee has asked for
 
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
clarification and some type of
 
00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 align:start position:0%
legislation to make this more workable
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
and so I would support
 
00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
you made the motion representative
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
Wallace anything to say
 
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
I think she covered it quite well let's
 
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
move the question I thought you would
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
um I will only add one thing from the
 
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
original Bill uh written by uh rep
 
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.129 align:start position:0%
original Bill uh written by uh rep
Gordon

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
Gordon
 
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
um and it's from the findings and
 
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
purpose he wrote that in order to comply
 
00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire's constitutional
 
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
requirements to satisfy statutory
 
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
requirements and to maintain the
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
confidence of the New Hampshire
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
citizenry in official legislative
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
activities recusal from voting on any
 
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
legislation when there is a conflict of
 
00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
interest is sometimes required
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think I could say it better than
 
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.590 align:start position:0%
I don't think I could say it better than
that

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'll ask the clerk to
 
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:20.089 align:start position:0%

um

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
the question has been put
 
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
any anywhere you want to go but you
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%

no you didn't ask me oh yes
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh the vote is nine zero
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
in the affirmative
 
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that takes care of
 
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1368
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.210 align:start position:0%
um welcome representative

00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 align:start position:0%

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
and I should preface this with um well
 
00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:10.919 align:start position:0%
no I'm going to look for a motion first
 
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
on um recommend or not recommend
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative Waller thank you Mr
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I do not recommend this
 
00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
for future legislation
 
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
oh second seconded by a very fine Clerk
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative Simon
 
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
if not I will explain the situation just
 
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
for the record
 
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.350 align:start position:0%
for the record
um

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:41.820 align:start position:0%
the original sponsor of the bill was
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
looking for recognition for
 
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:49.940 align:start position:0%
um and a songstress in her his district
 
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
was hoping to get some kind of a
 
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
certification or or something along
 
00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
those lines and and was perfectly happy
 
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
with getting a certificate from the
 
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.810 align:start position:0%
with getting a certificate from the
speaker

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
however we still had this bill to deal
 
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
with and in an effort to not have it
 
00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:13.019 align:start position:0%
come out out on the calendar as uh as uh
 
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate and and cause
 
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
difficulty with the constituent
 
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
um one of the possible solutions was for
 
00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:23.459 align:start position:0%
us to put it aside until after the the
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
ceremony and and she received the
 
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.170 align:start position:0%
ceremony and and she received the
certificate

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
so this is probably more a housekeeping
 
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:35.459 align:start position:0%
issue than anything else so
 
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
um I think probably the not recommend
 
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
for future legislation is is the only
 
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
course of action that we should take so
 
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
um no more
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
future discussion nope
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk to call the roll
 
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
representative Sheehan no representative
 
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.670 align:start position:0%
representative Sheehan no representative
Osborne

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
yes the recommendation is to not
 
00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:08.459 align:start position:0%
recommend so we would be yes if we
 
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
not recommend
 
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:14.220 align:start position:0%
would you like to I'd like to try that
 
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:16.100 align:start position:0%
again yes yes
 
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:20.339 align:start position:0%

uh clerk votes yes representative Berry
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%

00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
representative Smith yes representative
