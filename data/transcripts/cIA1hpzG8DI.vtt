00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
um one of the possible solutions was for
 

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.449 align:start position:0%
um one of the possible solutions was for
us<00:09:20.820><c> to</c><00:09:21.180><c> put</c><00:09:21.480><c> it</c><00:09:21.660><c> aside</c><00:09:21.959><c> until</c><00:09:22.200><c> after</c><00:09:22.560><c> the</c><00:09:23.040><c> the</c>

us to put it aside until after the the
 

00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:26.030 align:start position:0%
us to put it aside until after the the

so<00:09:27.959><c> this</c><00:09:28.740><c> is</c><00:09:28.980><c> probably</c><00:09:29.760><c> more</c><00:09:30.360><c> a</c><00:09:30.920><c> housekeeping</c>

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
so this is probably more a housekeeping
 

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.449 align:start position:0%
so this is probably more a housekeeping
issue<00:09:32.880><c> than</c><00:09:33.120><c> anything</c><00:09:33.480><c> else</c><00:09:33.839><c> so</c>

00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:35.459 align:start position:0%
issue than anything else so
 

00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:38.090 align:start position:0%
issue than anything else so
um I<00:09:35.880><c> think</c><00:09:36.120><c> probably</c><00:09:36.720><c> the</c><00:09:37.320><c> not</c><00:09:37.560><c> recommend</c>

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
um I think probably the not recommend
 

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.670 align:start position:0%
um I think probably the not recommend
for<00:09:38.399><c> future</c><00:09:38.580><c> legislation</c><00:09:39.240><c> is</c><00:09:39.600><c> is</c><00:09:40.019><c> the</c><00:09:40.500><c> only</c>

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
for future legislation is is the only
