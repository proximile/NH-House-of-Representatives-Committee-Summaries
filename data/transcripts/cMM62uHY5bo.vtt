one on T
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities making the decision
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
whether they can have political signs on
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
their public property now in
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
1979 the election laws were cified and
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
brought into being saw that they were in
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
order now even back in 1979 it stated
 
00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:30.519 align:start position:0%
there would not be political signs on
 
00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:32.110 align:start position:0%
there would not be political signs on
public

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
property whatever happened with that law
 
00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
is beyond me because it wasn't until
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
just the last several years that I knew
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
of anybody was saying you couldn't have
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
signs on public
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
property and like in my town up until
 
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
last year when we ran for election we
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
had two locations of property that
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
belongs to the town where Signs by
 
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
anyone could be put up there were
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
candidates last year we ran into the
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
state law and it happened everywhere why
 
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden I don't know same thing
 
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
happened in hill damry all the towns you
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
can no longer put signs on Municipal
 
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
property I feel it's wrong now I only
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
made a small change in the law I'm not a
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
lawyer I don't know if it's rooted cor
 
00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
really rooted correctly or if maybe you
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
would be willing to change something in
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
it and make an exception but
 
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities and not the state should
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
be the
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
ones that can say political signs can be
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
put on Municipal
 
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
property the state shouldn't be
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
dictating it and how has ever been this
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
way all these years I don't know and all
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
a sudden everybody noticed it or what
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
the problem is but it has created
 
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
problems everywhere because like I said
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
in Solsbury for years we just had the
 
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
signs in the same location nobody ever
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
said anything and then all of a sudden
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
the law came into being and uh and now
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
we're done so you know I'm going to end
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
it here and if you have any questions I
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
hope I can answer them and uh I just
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
hope you will find a way to make it
 
00:15:31.309 --> 00:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
possible for our 20 134 municipalities
 
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
to make the decision whether they want
 
00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
political signs or not in their town
 
00:15:36.199 --> 00:15:37.870 align:start position:0%

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
you that you couldn't put signs
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
up well we had an incident in our town
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
last year and they get into the state
 
00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:11.959 align:start position:0%
law and one the state law said we could
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
not put up signs anymore on Municipal
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
property okay thank you that answers my
 
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
question further questions
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman thank you madam
 
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
question on the public property does
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
that that include the right of
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
way any right of way in front of a
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
building or uh next to a sidewalk or
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
something like that well in the law it
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
states that you can't put signs on
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
public property but you can put them on
 
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
the states right of way and so this is
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
another big issue okay on Route four
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
where we used to put
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
signs how far back I mean none of us
 
00:16:59.790 --> 00:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
ever get into it it was right next to
 
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
the road it was considered public Pro uh
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
the town property but how far back does
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
the state own and if you could get into
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
real arguments and get into lawsuits and
 
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:13.720 align:start position:0%
this and that but to me it's not worth
 
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
it I think we just need
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
to see how we can make the law better so
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities can say you all can put
 
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
property okay thank you
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
representative majori thank you madam
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
chair wom and thank you for taking my
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
question um the word
 
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities um you have in here I
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
think you spoke to you we might have to
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
work on the language but who would be
 
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
the body deciding this you have
 
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
libraries you have select boards you
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
have town councils would it I are are
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
you suggesting that maybe this committee
 
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
needs to refine that word or are you
 
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
specific to the word
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
municipality okay I think we also need
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
to refine who in the M municipality has
 
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.510 align:start position:0%
to refine who in the M municipality has
that

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
Authority representative Dolan thank you
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:17.559 align:start position:0%
question uh is is there any
 
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
restriction uh
 
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
considered as a sponsor here uh that the
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
moderator's role would be reduced
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
because right now in many cases the
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
moderator decides if if
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
signage uh is in the proper place or if
 
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
it's inhibiting the voter's access to
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
the polling place and so
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
forth yeah I mean if the uh committee so
 
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
decided to make an amendment and felt
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
that the moderator would be the one
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
because yes in an election the moderator
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
has total control of everything so maybe
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
they should be the one that makes the
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
decision or maybe it should be the
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
select B you know I'm not sure who it
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
should be but it
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
may there has to be a
 
00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:10.039 align:start position:0%
definite body in the town that makes
 
00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
that kind of decision thank
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
you representative Murphy is recognized
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you madam chair
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:21.669 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
question

00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
electioneering is is that been brought
 
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.640 align:start position:0%

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
been having in your town people saying
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
this is election in for the town you
 
00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
know making one candidate or another
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
candidate or another position uh what
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
they're looking
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
for okay would you repeat that
 
00:19:44.909 --> 00:19:44.919 align:start position:0%
please the electioneering excuse
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
me some if you have a political sign
 
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
within whatever feat or whatever the
 
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
town ordinance says
 
00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
um you you know is is that been a
 
00:19:59.149 --> 00:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
problem in your town El you know where
 
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
political signs have been
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
placed how far from the polling place
 
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
are they are they
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
that further questions representative
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking another question uh would
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
this apply to a town hall or town office
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
building um in that my town is a
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan select board um but
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
as a State Rep I belong to a party so
 
00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:36.039 align:start position:0%
could I put my State Rep budget um sign
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
up on next to a sign that says town
 
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.549 align:start position:0%
up on next to a sign that says town
office

00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
building that would be up to each
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
individual municipality I mean the way
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
the law is written right now I mean
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
there are no political signs no place on
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
public property and if you changed it to
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities can make a ruling they
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
would have the ruling I mean according
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
to law where signs could be
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
placed further
 
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
questions I have a
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
question your language says um indicates
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
May the municipalities and we're
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
debating who that should be if it should
 
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
be a single person or perhaps the
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
governing body but your language says
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
may decide the locations assigns in that
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
municipality do you have a concern
 
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
concern that with this may decide that
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
that might end up with a patchwork of
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
application across the state and they
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
for you know candidates running in in
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
one municipality may be allowed to put
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
up signs whereas in the next town say
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
for example State reps would be not
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to to put up
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
signs you see what I'm saying yeah I
 
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
know what you're saying okay when this
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
was originally written we put sh
 
00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
instead of May and then several people I
 
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
talked to thought that we may not want
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
to dictate what a municipality has to do
 
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
so we put may I mean it can be changed
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
if an amendment is
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
made thank you additional questions
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie yes just quickly
 
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
would you believe that in my town on
 
00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
Election Day that the entrance into the
 
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
uh the voting PL
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
spot which is about oh
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
maybe 500 yards that there are signs all
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
the way going in to the voting place and
 
00:22:42.269 --> 00:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
there's never any a problem with
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
it well having political signs on
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
Election Day or any day it's an issue I
 
00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
realize it's never really be settled
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
because so many people have difference
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
of opinions and I know in uh some towns
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
they feel the the state shouldn't be
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
coming in on Election Day and telling
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
them where signs can and can be placed
 
00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:06.919 align:start position:0%
I've heard that but made statement made
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
before and in other towns are very
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
strict I feel it's up to each individual
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
town if this town wants this they get it
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
and if another town decides they want to
 
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
do something different it's up to
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
them thank you for your answer thank you
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
additional questions um representative
 
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.630 align:start position:0%

00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
my question my question has to do more
 
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
with uh an issue of kind of cognitive
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
dissonance in the wording of the bill
 
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
where um current law states that signs
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
may be placed with the owner's consent
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
and your change says the wordss
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities may decide to me those
 
00:23:56.909 --> 00:23:56.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.470 --> 00:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
thing that's why I think an amendment
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
should be made I mean I've been thinking
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
a lot about this lately and
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
maybe the amend the way I wrote the the
 
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
bill with just changing the part of one
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
sentence maybe uh under the exceptions M
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities could just be put put in
 
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
there along with uh you can have signs
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
on private property along the public
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
way with owner's permission and but then
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that answered if that
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
takes care of everything or not like I
 
00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:40.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
lawyer representative majority did did
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
you have a question I do yes thank you
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman and thank you for
 
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
taking another question um in line 14 of
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
of of this bill but existing language it
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
says that political advertising placees
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
that are fixed on any public property
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
may be removed by the state was there
 
00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:00.590 align:start position:0%
may be removed by the state was there
any

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:04.039 align:start position:0%
consideration that that sentence in
 
00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
there may create a problem if the same
 
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
organization is allowing it the same
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
organization May remove
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
it well if municipalities are given
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
permission to have C you know make their
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
own rules on candidate
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
signs then the state shouldn't be able
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
to come along and remove move them if
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
frock thank you madam
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
chair and representative I in listening
 
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
to the questions and your
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
responses um I would like to ask you to
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
clarify my understanding of the statute
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
66417 which is what you are proposing to
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
modify um my read on
 
00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:06.430 align:start position:0%
modify um my read on
this

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
basically does not um include
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
signs that are placed at or near the
 
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.789 align:start position:0%
signs that are placed at or near the
polling

00:26:17.789 --> 00:26:17.799 align:start position:0%
polling
 
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
placeat um which may or may not be
 
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.789 align:start position:0%
placeat um which may or may not be
considered

00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
electioneering this statute refers to
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
election signs that are placed
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
on public
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
highways um your concern is placement on
 
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
Municipal property and I I guess to to
 
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
boil the question
 
00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
down does it refer to signs
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
placed on Municipal property in
 
00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
general or is it specifically limited to
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
signs that are placed near the polling
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
place which might be considered
 
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
electioneering if they were too close to
 
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.230 align:start position:0%
electioneering if they were too close to
the

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
poll well if anything was passed that
 
00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:11.190 align:start position:0%
poll well if anything was passed that
gave

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
gave
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities the ability to make their
 
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
own rules and regulations they've got to
 
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
go by whatever the state law says so
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
if in the state law it says you can't do
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
election Heering then this municipality
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
would not be able to go against de and
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
make up their own rules and regulations
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to go by whatever
 
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
the the rest of the state law
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%

Schultz good morning and welcome to

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your consideration of my
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
testimony in support of HB 512 as a
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
resident of Northampton New Hampshire
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
I'm deeply concerned about a decision
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
made over a year ago by our select board
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
members they approved our full-time Town
 
00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
Administrator to simultaneously hold a
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
part-time position in Newcastle New
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire without public
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
consultation this decision was made in a
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
non-public meeting denying residents and
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the opportunity to express
 
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
their concerns when residents later
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
questioned why our town should continue
 
00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
paying a full-time salary for a Town
 
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
Administrator now dividing his week
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
between two towns they were dismissed as
 
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
out of hand the select board argued that
 
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
as long as there was no scheduling
 
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
conflict it wasn't an issue however as a
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayer I find it illogical to
 
00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:24.519 align:start position:0%
compensate an employee for full-time
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
work when they are serving another town
 
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
2 days a week
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
especially without any public hearing or
 
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
input from
 
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:34.519 align:start position:0%
residents over the past year while
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
sharing Town Administrator we
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
experienced the resignation of a police
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
chief a police force operating at half
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
capacity and most recently the
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
resignation of a highly respected fire
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
chief these events indicate that Duties
 
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
are not being fulfilled effectively
 
00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
further upon submitting a 91a request to
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
both the towns of Northampton and
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
Newcastle as to the time sheets and
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
build hours committed I was denied the
 
00:33:02.669 --> 00:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
right to that
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
information I asked this committee what
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
recourse residents have when it appears
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
that the select board is being directed
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
by the Town Administrator rather than
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
providing oversight on issues such as
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
this opponents May argue that such
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
decision should remain local and that
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
legislation is
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
unnecessary however as New Hampshire is
 
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
a Dillan rule state and whereas this law
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
would impact multiple mun municipalities
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
I urge the legislature to address this
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
issue to ensure New Hampshire taxpayers
 
00:33:34.639 --> 00:33:35.430 align:start position:0%
issue to ensure New Hampshire taxpayers
have

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
recourse additionally in order to
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
advance this bill to the house floor I
 
00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
ask that you amend it to remove the
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
following sentences any person who fails
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
to report accept acceptance of a new
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
town manager or administrator employment
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
offer while under contract as a town
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
manager administrator shall be guilty of
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
a felony uh and this appears uh in both
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
Section 1 3 and section 23 with a little
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
variation in the text passing the bill
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
without the language related to
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
criminality would still offer New
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers essential recourse
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
and could improve this legislation's
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
chances of approval in both the House
 
00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
and Senate I urge you to put forth an
 
00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
amendment outlined above and vote ought
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended on this much needed
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you for your time and
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.000 align:start position:0%

uh good morning members of the committee
 
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Barett Christina I am the
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
school boards Association we are opposed
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
to House Bill
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
512 um I went through um the list of
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
current superintendents and the current
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
school administrative units that they
 
00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:28.599 align:start position:0%
are assigned to the district of Siri and
 
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
Sullivan have the same individual
 
00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
serving as their superintendent they are
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
two Siri is one as school administrative
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
unit Sullivan is a separate school
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
administrative unit neither of those
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
districts have a school they tuition
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
their students so they have one
 
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
individual Ser serving both of those
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
school districts on I don't even know
 
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
maybe a one day a week type of basis so
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
they we're not talking about somebody
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
working full-time in one district and
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
full-time in another District like
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
likewise the SAU of Winchester SAU 94
 
00:36:05.069 --> 00:36:05.079 align:start position:0%
and Hinsdale SAU 92 also have these same
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
individual serving um as superintendent
 
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
I believe that individual was three days
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
in one district and two days in in
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
another District I'm not sure which
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
which one is three which one is two but
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
I know totality he's working full-time
 
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
but he's got two separate contracts for
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
two separate school administrative units
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
um the same situation in planfield and
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
Cornish again the same individual um is
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
is working for both of those school
 
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
administrative units part-time in one
 
00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
District part-time in another District
 
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
Alton and Barnstead two separate saus
 
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
have the same individual um working um
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
as as the superintendent in that SAU um
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
or in those two actually three saus that
 
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
actually make sense Alton is one SAU I
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
believe they SAU 72 and Barnstead I
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
forget maybe SAU
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
886 they send their children to prospect
 
00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
Mountain High School which is a separate
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
SAU so you've got one superintendent
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
serving one k through eight District
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
same superintendent serving another K
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
through 8 district and then the same
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent is serving for a separate
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
seu but that's their joint high school
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
so in that situation you're or you're
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
lining up your policies your curriculum
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth the last aspect that
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
nhba would like to address is on page 16
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
of the bill it says no school
 
00:37:27.069 --> 00:37:27.079 align:start position:0%
superintendent shall be compensated for
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
service as a school superintendent under
 
00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:32.839 align:start position:0%
two a more Contra two or more contracts
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
at the same time I presume that the
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
intent of the well I don't want to
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
presume the intent of the bill but as
 
00:37:40.109 --> 00:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
I'm reading that I'm wondering if the
 
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
gist was two individual employment
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
contracts and I raised that as the
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
language is confusing in at least two
 
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances we have here in New
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the Rollinsford School
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
District purchases services from the
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
summersworth school district so the
 
00:37:58.349 --> 00:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
individual is the is the superintendent
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
of summersworth that is his title but
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
rowford pays the summersworth school
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
district a certain sum of money to have
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
that person serve as a superintendent
 
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
provide superintendent services so
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
technically that is
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
a superintendent under two or more
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
contracts at the same time um and the
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
same circumstance um applies to Governor
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
Wentworth which is
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
sa49 and Middleton I forget Middleton's
 
00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:27.079 align:start position:0%
um SAU number but the Middleton School
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
District purchases services from the
 
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
governor Wentworth School District so
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately the superintendent in the
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
governor Wentworth school district is
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for the superintendent
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
services in in the Middleton School
 
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
District as well too this is not a
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
concern for these districts um that that
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
I've referenced they understand that the
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
individual is working another part-time
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
gig in a different in a different um
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
school administrative unit and and they
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
all seem to be fine with the current
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
Arrangement that they have so nhba
 
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
objects um to the to the provisions um
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
relative to superintendent contracts we
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
oppose House Bill 512 and I'm happy to
 
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that the committee
 
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.069 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that the committee
may

00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
have thank you attorney Christina
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative frock thank you
 
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
question um if the bill were amended to
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
allow for an individual
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
to be employed part-time
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
by more than one District would your
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
organization continue to be opposed um
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
representative um as I'm
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
reading the bill at least as it relates
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
to the school superintendent
 
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
contracts you know it doesn't say
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
anything about full-time or part-time so
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to I'm not trying to
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
avoid the question representative but I
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
mean our position would be that you know
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
we would support striking out the entire
 
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
language as it relates to school
 
00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:02.599 align:start position:0%
districts I don't think a clarification
 
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
about part-time or for full-time is is
 
00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you for your response
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative stavis is
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair this is a question of the
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
chair um in the event that a prime
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor does not appear to testify as to
 
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
the reasons for the bill is it proper
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
for us to be asking um PE people who are
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
giving giving testimony if they are
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you for the question
 
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
representative Davis my answer to that
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
would be um yes I I do feel that it's
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate because once the bill is
 
00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:44.839 align:start position:0%
introduced the build belongs now to the
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
committee and we are present and we
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be the ones that would be um
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
deciding upon an amendment does that
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan thank you madam
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my
 
00:41:07.309 --> 00:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
question if I look at this as a local
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
issue a one-town
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
issue uh I'm thinking uh about the
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
sponsor asking the state to referee
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
their their one toown issue what is
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
there anything that you can see in this
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
bill that would prevent the town from
 
00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.829 align:start position:0%
bill that would prevent the town from
pursuing

00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
pursuing
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
a local warrant article to fix this or
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
even a citizen's petition to referee
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
this rather than the state using its
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
heavy hand to come in and and decide it
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
for them sure thank you very much for
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
the question I mean nhba generally not
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
100% of the time advocates for local
 
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
control and a local school district
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
should be able to hire who they want
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
within their within their building or
 
00:41:50.589 --> 00:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
their school administrative unit the
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
other one of the other concerns that NH
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
I mean yes so to to to the larger
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
question nhba has an rejection to a
 
00:41:59.470 --> 00:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
state law dictating how local contracts
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
can work you know for a local for local
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
municipality local school district a
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
local school administrative unit the
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
other challenge that I would see with
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
this with this bill is that the ACT
 
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
shall take effect 60 days after its
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
passage so let's just play this out and
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
presume this became law and became
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
effective let's say August 1st the
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
superintendent that I referenced they
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
may have three or fouryear contracts so
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
I don't know how that's going to get
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
rectified either so I hope that answered
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
your questions sir thank
 
00:42:33.069 --> 00:42:33.079 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um in these many
 
00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
communities that share a
 
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.150 align:start position:0%
communities that share a
superintendent

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
um do you feel it is a financial benefit
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
for those communities in keeping their
 
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
property taxes at a reasonable level
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh for the question
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
representative certainly a school
 
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
board's decision on whether or not to
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
high a part-time or a super or a
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
full-time superintendent is based on a
 
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
variety of factors the economics of that
 
00:43:06.549 --> 00:43:06.559 align:start position:0%
Community what that Community can afford
 
00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
to pay superintendent and basically the
 
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
size of the school district how many
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
students you have how many buildings
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
you're operating we have many I I I
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
don't even know offand but I would it
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
would not surprise me if we have
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
probably a dozen a couple dozen
 
00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:23.559 align:start position:0%
superintendant that are part-time
 
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
because the community is small and in
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
the district is small um I didn't think
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
about it during my original introduction
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
but your question got me thinking about
 
00:43:33.549 --> 00:43:33.559 align:start position:0%
it representative the other aspect to
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
the larger policy concern is that um we
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
have more and more school administrative
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
units today than we ever have 20 years
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
ago there were maybe 80 or 85 85 84 885
 
00:43:47.069 --> 00:43:47.079 align:start position:0%
today we're up to about 107 so every
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
year there's more school administrative
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
units that means there's a need for more
 
00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
school school superintendence we don't
 
00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
have people going into that field as
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
much as we used to maybe 30 years ago so
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
we have more saus and a fewer number of
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
people to fill those positions so the
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
idea that an individual and a lot of the
 
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
part-time positions they're retired
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
people they'll work one day a week in
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
this district and one another day a week
 
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
in in another District so so that's I
 
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
guess the larger policy concerned with
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative further
 
00:44:20.589 --> 00:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
questions so um representativ col's
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
question is a good segue to my question
 
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
would would you be able to briefly
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
explain to the committee the process
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
um by which a superintendent is hired in
 
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
in that are there hearings is there
 
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity for public input it does one
 
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
person um decide the contract the school
 
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
board in multi- toown um saus the school
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
board might be comprised of many school
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
boards could you just go over that
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you very much for the
 
00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:51.079 align:start position:0%
question Madam chair um I can speak to
 
00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
directly to my experiences conducting
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
superintendent searches for for school
 
00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:56.559 align:start position:0%
intive units and then I can speak
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
anecdotally on what some other districts
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
may do um by way of background the
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
school boards Association does conduct
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent searches um for our
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
members um it's it's a four fee service
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
that we provide we do anywhere between 2
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
and 10 in any given year myself I've
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
probably done two dozen in the last
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
maybe seven or eight years um a a medium
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
to a larger size School District um the
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
school board or say you the school board
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
will um usually um comprise a committee
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
you'll have a couple teachers a couple
 
00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
administrators a couple school board
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
members a couple parents couple teachers
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
couple General community members if you
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
will uh that that committee will
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
comprise a a district leadership these
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
are public meetings because a
 
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard committee meeting your
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
policy committee your facilities
 
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
committee all have to be posted a notice
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
under under the right to no law so the
 
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
committee meetings are are public The
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
public's free to attend um and has a
 
00:45:54.549 --> 00:45:54.559 align:start position:0%
right to attend I should say um uh they
 
00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:56.559 align:start position:0%
will develop a leadership profile
 
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
develop the advertisement develop
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
attributes they will do community
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
surveys get feedback from parents get
 
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
feedback from teachers get feedback from
 
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
students feedback from the community at
 
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
large with that they develop a
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
leadership profile put together a um uh
 
00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:15.079 align:start position:0%
uh the advertisement um number of
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
different ways they can advertise um
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
they'll do a first round of interviews
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
those are usually a non-public session
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
um which is allowable under 91 A2
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph 3B the hiring of any person as
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
a Public Employee um and then they'll
 
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
call that down to maybe two or three
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
finalists and then do open public
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
interviews with those with those final
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
candidates the committee usually makes a
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the school board um
 
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
and then the school board um interviews
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
that candidate the candidates for a
 
00:46:46.829 --> 00:46:46.839 align:start position:0%
final time and ultimately makes a makes
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
a decision on how to hire the the
 
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
superintendent that's an ideal
 
00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
circumstance some of the smaller school
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
districts the school board may just post
 
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
an advertisement and interview people
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
and people on their own um or I can also
 
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
say that if a superintendent leaves in
 
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
the middle of a school year um I go
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
through my what I call my roll adex I
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
keep a list of individuals mostly
 
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
retired superintendents or indiv
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
superintendents who are working
 
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
part-time that I know may be interested
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
and picking up another 10hour a week gig
 
00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
here or there and then I'll pass them on
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
to the board and they'll do a a quick
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
interview but but so for a full search
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
in a medium large size District there's
 
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the public to to
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
participate thank you a followup to that
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
is with regards to current employment of
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
any of these candidates is that publicly
 
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
disclosed or
 
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:36.760 align:start position:0%

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
by whom the public yeah the the public
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
who's who would be you know because the
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
salary would be um paid through taxpayer
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
dollars and also the public being the
 
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
the people serving on the school boards
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
in the Committees um interviewing and
 
00:47:59.790 --> 00:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
making this decision yeah thank you very
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
much for the question uh Madam chair um
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
yeah nhba generally advises that the
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
first interview um take place in
 
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
non-public session and the candidates um
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
application materials resume letters of
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation so on and so forth are
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
not publicly disclosed at that point um
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
because there's a privacy interest for
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
the individual that's is the candidate
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
they may not their school board if it's
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
a superintendent in one District their

not know that they're looking for
 
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
another job and that can create some
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
some tension that you might not
 
00:48:33.069 --> 00:48:33.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily want but so we tell our
 
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:35.960 align:start position:0%

which is fine I defer to his expertise
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
and wisdom um as you know well I should
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
state that the nhsa opposes this bill we
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
feel like it would just be curtail what
 
00:50:03.309 --> 00:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
small and Rural communities can do in
 
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
their search for executive leadership
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
for their school districts excuse me as
 
00:50:11.549 --> 00:50:11.559 align:start position:0%
you know New Hampshire is a rural State
 
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't come as a surprise cooperative
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
and Regional School districts are found
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
throughout our state and community
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
seeking collaboration appropriate
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
efficiencies economies of scale and most
 
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
importantly opportunities for their
 
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.750 align:start position:0%
importantly opportunities for their
students

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
will oftentimes seek to collaborate with
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
their administrative leadership in a way
 
00:50:34.789 --> 00:50:34.799 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they are holding on to
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
their community's identity as well as
 
00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:40.359 align:start position:0%
fostering more opportunity and savings
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
for their
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
districts that's essentially all I
 
00:50:47.789 --> 00:50:47.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to state in that I think this
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do is sty me that
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh that search for
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
efficiency and ultimately impact the
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities that students are offered
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:01.720 align:start position:0%

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
relative to filling vacant positions on
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
elected mun ipal and select boards um
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
this bill although it's a few pages is
 
00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward it basically says
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
when the like when Municipal boards have
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
the right to fill a
 
00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:39.799 align:start position:0%
vacancy and they choose to they choose
 
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
to fill the vacancy from people that had
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
ran for the position and lost if they
 
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
choose to C if they choose to fill it
 
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
with from the pool of losers they have
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
to pick the person who got the next
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
highest number of votes and that way it
 
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
respects the rule of the voter so
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
basically Let me Give an example um I
 
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:01.160 align:start position:0%

school board chose the person that
 
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
received sixth place in that pre most
 
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
previous election instead of the person
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
that that received the the next highest
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
number of votes who also applied for the
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
position so I guess what I want to say
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
is I want this process to be fair and I
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
want to respect the the will of the
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
voters so if the if the board chooses to
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
fill a vacancy with an applicant that
 
00:56:46.029 --> 00:56:46.039 align:start position:0%
ran in any of the last three elections
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
for office they must first extend the
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
offer to the runner up in the most
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
previous election this doesn't require
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
them this doesn't require them to pick
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
the run her up this just gives this says
 
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
if they are going to choose somebody
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
that ran in the last previous three
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
elections they have to first extend it
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
to the next highest vote getter that was
 
00:57:06.119 --> 00:57:06.910 align:start position:0%
to the next highest vote getter that was
a

00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
loser I hope that makes sense to
 
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
everybody so the first
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
loser okay and that mainly the intent is
 
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
just to respect the will of Voters
 
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes in races it benefits one party
 
00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:21.640 align:start position:0%
over the other but it is the I feel like
 
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
in in this sense is the most Fair way to
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
conduct picking of replacement for a
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
municipal board um
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm happy to answer
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
questions I think this pretty
 
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
straightforward I'm sure I I could have
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
done better with this but I was in
 
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:41.799 align:start position:0%
another committee questions the chair
 
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Guthrie for a
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I really have
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
two if I have a runner up uh isn't it
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
possible that the uh in the example you
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
gave that the school committee could
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
have selected the third the Le the next
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
runner up they could
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
have isn't I if I could Madam chair uh
 
00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:18.039 align:start position:0%
fall to give another exception exception
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
which is a possibility where you have a
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh a two person race with three
 
00:58:25.319 --> 00:58:26.630 align:start position:0%
uh a two person race with three
candidates

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
and the third candidates get six
 
00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
votes because it's that's the way it is
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
the first the top two
 
00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:37.720 align:start position:0%
candidates uh overwhelmingly and the
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
third candidate is someone
 
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
that just is running for because he's
 
00:58:47.789 --> 00:58:47.799 align:start position:0%
interested that's or he she is
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
interested uh they would have to if
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
they'll spill passes they would have to
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
offer the school committee would have
 
00:58:58.349 --> 00:58:58.359 align:start position:0%
have to offer the
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
job uh the re replacement to that runner
 
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
up even though you only got three or
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
four votes they would not they would not
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
because the language in here says if the
 
00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:10.839 align:start position:0%
committee chooses to fill a vacancy with
 
00:59:14.589 --> 00:59:14.599 align:start position:0%
an applicant who ran if they must choose
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
the first runner up they don't have to
 
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
right like we're not forcing boards to
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
pick the next runner up in the most
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
previous election that candidate might
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
not even want it anymore right like but
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
we're saying in this situation if they
 
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
do right they they that board probably
 
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't choose the person who got six
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
votes but if they decided to pick
 
00:59:34.829 --> 00:59:34.839 align:start position:0%
somebody in the last election cycle
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
they'd have to at least offer it to that
 
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
person who got six votes first in that
 
00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
case the situation in gtown what
 
00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
happened is there is a board who and
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
this happened more or less in non-public
 
00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
which I think was also against the law
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
but um The Filling of this vacancy
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
happened based on almost an
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
ideological um
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
a belief that one candidate is going to
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
carry the board's Mission differently
 
01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
than another candidate and the candidate
 
01:00:05.789 --> 01:00:05.799 align:start position:0%
who got fourth place is from a
 
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:07.640 align:start position:0%
conservative wing of the town and the
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
candidate who got sixth place is from
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
more of a left wing of the town and so
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
this situation the school board picked
 
01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
the more left-wing candidate to help
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
fill the
 
01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
vacancy so again I think I'm not trying
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
to bring party into this at all because
 
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do with partisan
 
01:00:26.029 --> 01:00:26.039 align:start position:0%
politics what this has to do is it
 
01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
respecting the will of the voter so the
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
next highest vote getter should be the
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
one that the positions offered to if
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
to representative Colby has a question
 
01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I'm looking for
 
01:00:46.589 --> 01:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
clarification I'm not sure that the
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
language of the
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill is the same as this what you're
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
describing I guess in how I read this
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
and please please correct me if a board
 
01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.270 align:start position:0%
and please please correct me if a board
receives

01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
receives
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
applications then they would have to
 
01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:05.039 align:start position:0%
review the last three prior elections to
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
determine if any of the applicants have
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
run for office run for that particular
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
position correct then the bill would
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
suggests they pass up all other
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
candidates even if an application came
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
in that were more
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
qualified to offer offer the position to
 
01:01:27.549 --> 01:01:27.559 align:start position:0%
the first runner up from the previous
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
election am I am I no what would happen
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
is say there's or they just have to
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
notify say there's three no say there's
 
01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
um three people are looking to fill a
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
position on a library Board of
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
Trustees one of them ran in the last
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
previous election the other two have
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
never run for the position at all the
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
board could pick one of the other two
 
01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
that have never run for the position at
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
all but say at the library Board of
 
01:01:57.549 --> 01:01:57.559 align:start position:0%
Trustees two of the candidates both ran
 
01:01:57.559 --> 01:01:58.309 align:start position:0%
Trustees two of the candidates both ran
for

01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
trustee and they wanted to offer the
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
position to one of those candidates they
 
01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
would have to offer it to the person who
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
got the most amount of votes in the last
 
01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
previous election but they do not have
 
01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.710 align:start position:0%
previous election but they do not have
to

01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
followup yes that is not
 
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
what the language describes so that's
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
why explain explain me where the
 
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
language is is vague to you I'm just
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
trying ask really the committee um and
 
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm sorry if the
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
committee Cho es to fill a vacancy with
 
01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:30.039 align:start position:0%
an applicant who ran in any of the last
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
three elections for the office they must
 
01:02:36.269 --> 01:02:36.279 align:start position:0%
first extend an offer to the runner up
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
election

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
I the way I see it is that that's pretty
 
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
straightforward and this is this is um
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
the reason why this bill is so long is
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
it has to do with budget committee
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
membership Charter commission membership
 
01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:57.920 align:start position:0%

01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
vacancies so like Library boards and
 
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist that's why
 
01:03:05.549 --> 01:03:05.559 align:start position:0%
it's so long is they have they had to
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
change the RSA in every single place
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
where a municipal board or School Board
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
is being appointed but it it says the
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
same thing in every paragraph just to
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
make it clear across all the rsas okay
 
01:03:18.269 --> 01:03:18.279 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
01:03:18.279 --> 01:03:19.470 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
representative

01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:03:22.829 --> 01:03:22.839 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
question of
 
01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
course we all know that in local
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
elections they were talking about here
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
Dynamics change once an election is
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
complete candidates selected or voted in
 
01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
or voted out U so my question is given
 
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:43.720 align:start position:0%
that isn't the right thing just to hold
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
a special election and and let the
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
voters decide based on the remaining
 
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
candidates that are available to them
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
that are signed up you know have a an
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
open and honest election through a
 
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
special election I know there's some
 
01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
cost involved but yeah that's a that's a
 
01:03:59.710 --> 01:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
great question and and this bill is in
 
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
the committee hands I was just trying to
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
find a way to make it as inexpensive for
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
a town to fill a vacancy while Al also
 
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
respecting the will of the voters in the
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
last previous election
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
so the the town towns already have a
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
right to appoint somebody to fill these
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
vacancies all it's extending is the the
 
01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
next highest vote getter would have an
 
01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity if they choose to fill it um
 
01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:24.200 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that we necessarily
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
need a whole special election for it I
 
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
think it is an added cost for the town
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
and you might not have the same amount
 
01:04:32.589 --> 01:04:32.599 align:start position:0%
of turnout for that position so um the
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
the bill is in your hands but I think
 
01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
that this is the most inexpensive way to
 
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
also um respect the will of Voters
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
without having an extra
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
election the chair will recognize
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative stavis and then
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative Walker thank you madam
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
question um what
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
if what if the runner up in the most
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
recent prior election has moved
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
away then they don't have to offer that
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
position because they wouldn't be
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
qualified for the position it doesn't
 
01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
say that sorry madam chair no and and
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
respectfully they can't offer the
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
position to somebody who's not qualified
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
to serve I I don't think you need the
 
01:05:14.269 --> 01:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
language in the RSA to say they have to
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
offer it even if they don't even live in
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
the municipality or the Zone because
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
unqualified thank you you're
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
welcome chair recognizes representative
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
Walker is this language is uh kind of
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
contradictory in my view you say here
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
that if the board chooses to fill a
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
vacancy with an applicant who ran in
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
last three elections you must first
 
01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
offer it to the runner
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
up and then you say at the end of your
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
sentence but they don't have
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
to that kind of contradicts
 
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
itself okay first sentence if the
 
01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.309 align:start position:0%
itself okay first sentence if the
committee

01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:05:50.319 --> 01:05:52.309 align:start position:0%
committee
chooses

01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
chooses
 
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
okay that that right there is them
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
allowing the choice to pick between
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
applicants that have ran before and
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
those that have not if they choose not
 
01:06:04.109 --> 01:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
to to choose any of the applicants who
 
01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
ran then it would this this wouldn't
 
01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
position if they do they must first
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
extend it doesn't mean they have to may
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
I follow up
 
01:06:21.069 --> 01:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
yes how can a board choose not to fill a
 
01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:23.839 align:start position:0%
vacancy if it's on an important
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
board maybe it's a town I'm from the
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
city of Rochester that doesn't make
 
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
sense to me because if they choose to
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
fill it they can leave it vacant but if
 
01:06:36.269 --> 01:06:36.279 align:start position:0%
you choose to fill it you must take the
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
next guy the guy may not be qualified
 
01:06:41.309 --> 01:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
for it representative I think you're
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
reading it wrong because if the
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
committee chooses to fill the
 
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
vacancy with an
 
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
applicant they must first extend it to
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
the the runner up that they could choose
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
not to fill it they could choose to fill
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
they could choose to fill it with Mickey
 
01:06:59.710 --> 01:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
Mouse right but if Mickey Mouse if
 
01:07:02.029 --> 01:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
Donald Duck ran in the last election and
 
01:07:04.109 --> 01:07:04.119 align:start position:0%
Donald Duck was applying and they choose
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
to go between Donald Chuck Donald Duck
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
Minnie Mouse and then Mickey Mouse
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
didn't even run they'd have to choose
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
Donald Duck because he got the next
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
amount of votes it's it's I I'm trying I
 
01:07:15.309 --> 01:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know how else to explain
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
it's representative Walker could you
 
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
shut your mic off oh I know so I might
 
01:07:27.069 --> 01:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
be able to help here thank you so um the
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
construct of the sentence might be a
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
little off I would like to see if then
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
so the if Clause needs to be taken in it
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
in its entirety and it would be if the
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
committee chooses to fill a vacancy with
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
an applicant who
 
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
ran in any of the last three elections
 
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
so all those things need to be true if
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's the way that they're going to do
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
with all parts being true
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
then then the the bill language says is
 
01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
that they must first extend the offer to
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
the runner up with the most well it
 
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
would be the person with the most um
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
votes in the most recent prior election
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
so you have to take it all together and
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
then I would also say that perhaps what
 
01:08:15.669 --> 01:08:15.679 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do here is make this be
 
01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
enabling by by it's a choice it's not
 
01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
you have to do it this way it's you may
 
01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
do it this way if this is the path
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
you're going down I don't know if that
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
helps further questions that's like that
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
and and thank you I wasn't an English
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
major and I think the if then Clause
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
really helps clarify that so thank you
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
very much Madam chair yeah and there's
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
no then in the sentence either
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
so okay um
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
Gerard thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
repres for taking my question again I
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you have in the spill
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
and from what I'm hearing you say
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
basically this may actually have the
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
boards were they're sitting here trying
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
to get candidates that haven't run for
 
01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
election so that way if there was
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
somebody they didn't want to have on it
 
01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
they could actually get around it that
 
01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
way is basic if I'm hearing what you're
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
saying correctly yep thank
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
majority is recognized thank you madam
 
01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
chair wooden thank you for taking my
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
question um what if there was a
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
tie for the runner up and you know one
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
more is that kind contemplated here it's
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
not okay it's a great
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
question I think that would be very yeah
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.709 align:start position:0%
I don't
representative

01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
um grund grund is recognized and then
 
01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
repres I know you've had a couple ties
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative and then representative
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
Guthrie be because you already asked a
 
01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
question so representative grund thank
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
01:09:52.349 --> 01:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
my question so this is just selecting to
 
01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
fill the open vacancy and then the
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
following thing that happens is that
 
01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
there's an election because someone has
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
to actually run for the remaining part
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
position be a so you're not asking to
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
override that piece you're just asking
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
for that it could be a three-month piece
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
it could be a six Monon stint until they
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
10 days yep okay it could be as yeah
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's great a good point representative
 
01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:19.870 align:start position:0%
that's great a good point representative
goth

01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
goth
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
three thank you madam chair for letting
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
me ask an additional question thank you
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
for your question
 
01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh I it it I have a problem with whether
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
or not this is is necessary because this
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
the school committee or The Bard
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
selectman or whoever's making the
 
01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
appointment can follow this this
 
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
direction if they they want but are you
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
assuming that the person who comes in
 
01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
third in a twers race is in fact the the
 
01:10:59.149 --> 01:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
third choice of the electorate or is it
 
01:11:03.149 --> 01:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
just that they happen to get be in the
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
race for a two person person race and
 
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
they come in third I don't know if
 
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
that's clear or not no I mean I mean
 
01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
hypothetically if there's more
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
undervotes than that person received
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
maybe they aren't the third choice but
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
nobody else stepped ahead maybe if
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
there's a right in that received more
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
votes than the person on the ballot for
 
01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
third place they would offer it to the
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
right end because that person received
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
more votes
 
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
so I I think it's hypothetical I mean I
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know how else to answer
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
that question representative if I follow
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
up mam chair just if I could uh just
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
quickly it's it it seems to me that what
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do is a good thing
 
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
because uh I've I've had been in this
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
position a lot of times and we try have
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
always tried to pick that person who
 
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
showed an interest particularly if there
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
was nobody else interest CU it's all all
 
01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of possibilities but I would
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
suggest to you that uh without this bill
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
the individual committees who are making
 
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
the reappointment or the fill in
 
01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
appointment have the right to do this
 
01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
and should be aware that there's good
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
process to follow what you're trying to
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
do that it it may be best practice
 
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
representative I think in the ideal
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
world if a if a committee make an
 
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
appointment they would first offer I
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
think think they would first offer it to
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
the next highest vot getter I think if
 
01:12:29.229 --> 01:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
you know I serve on the budget committee
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
if that was something that happened I
 
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
would be like okay well who got the next
 
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
amount like who's interested but I think
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
the problem that we run into is maybe
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
not in your District but in other
 
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
districts there
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
are um ideological boards right that
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
have a clear position on something and
 
01:12:49.629 --> 01:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
they want to move in a certain direction
 
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
and the next highest vot atter might not
 
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
be the one that helps them fulfill the
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
mission that they're trying to do
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
but the six Place person does so what
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to do the intent of this bill
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
is to is to respect the voters in my
 
01:13:05.550 --> 01:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
situation of gtown that you know the
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
person lost by 40 votes but the person
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
they picked was somebody that lost by
 
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
hundreds so it it just seems like
 
01:13:15.149 --> 01:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
respecting what the voters did on town
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
meeting day I they were a loser both of
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
them were losers right but one was less
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
of a loser right and I think in that
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
situation they should if you're going to
 
01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
offer it you're going to offer it to the
 
01:13:25.159 --> 01:13:28.189 align:start position:0%
offer it you're going to offer it to the
next

01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
person thank you thank you madam
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
chair additional
 
01:13:37.709 --> 01:13:37.719 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
Des good morning Mr Dees welcome to
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government uh good
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
morning thank you madam chairwoman thank
 
01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
you to the committee uh for the record
 
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
my name is biry Dees I represent the N
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
and we are opposed to the bill as
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
written um our interpretation is the
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
same as what representative Colby shared
 
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
which is um specifically we we interpret
 
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
extend the offer as offering the
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
position to the individual and we read
 
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
it as provided that the board chooses to
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
fill a vacancy so if they choose to fill
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
a vacancy on the Committees and the
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
boards listed in this legislation um if
 
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
they offer that vacancy to anyone who
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
ran in the last three elections um they
 
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
must first extend the offer to the
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
runner up of the most prior election um
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
now it's been pointed out that someone
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
could be a runner up but lose by a lot
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
and that happens often in many local
 
01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
elections um there are people who might
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
be interested or unqualified for a board
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
and um and the voters reject them and so
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's the will of the voters so to then
 
01:14:48.629 --> 01:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
make it so it's automatically that they
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
become the first person who has to be
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
offered the vacancy um is kind of
 
01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
undermining the will of the voters in it
 
01:14:57.149 --> 01:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
also impedes the ability of local boards
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
and committees to determine who is the
 
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
most qualified candidate to serve on the
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
board um I also want to point out that
 
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
the that a person who ran in the
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
previous three elections may have W or
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
been an experience incumbent it's very
 
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
often that boards will go to someone to
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
fill a vacancy and to serve out the rest
 
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
of a term who has experience and has won
 
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
elections because they might not be
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
interested in running again so it kind
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
of guarantees that the seat will open up
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
again but in the interim you have a very
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
experienced person who will be on the
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
board and serve and help further um good
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
efficient government for that Community
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
um again as pointed out by
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie this kind of
 
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
impedes local boards and committies
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
ability to choose the most qualified
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
Andor experienced person and Boards do
 
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
try to find you know they try to choose
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
candidates who have shown interest in
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
serving the office but there are times
 
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
where someone has shown interest but
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
they're just not qualified and the
 
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
voters have resly rejected them in
 
01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
multiple elections I would imagine a
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
border or committee is not going to want
 
01:15:55.950 --> 01:15:55.960 align:start position:0%
to appoint someone who the voters have
 
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
rejected multiple times I mean you know
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
the voters would probably be very
 
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
confused and upset um if that was the
 
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
case um and these are also local issues
 
01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
and are best addressed locally and this
 
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
kind of over complicates a simple
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
process boards and committees currently
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
post say there's a vacancy there's an
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
opening we're looking for applicants
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
people will write letters in the boards
 
01:16:18.430 --> 01:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
will review those letters and they will
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
choose the person who is the most
 
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
qualified and they do take into context
 
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
have they ran an election have they won
 
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
an election have they served on a Bo
 
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
board what's your experience
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
professional experience often times can
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
be something they want to really
 
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
consider in a candidate um so for all
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
those reasons we'd ask you to please
 
01:16:36.669 --> 01:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
reject the bill as written and um I'll
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if there are any
 
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative grund thank you
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
question and something that was asked
 
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:51.320 align:start position:0%
earlier um I just want to get an
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
opinion if you're truly on the will of
 
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
the voters would you hold a special
 
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.790 align:start position:0%
the voters would you hold a special
election

01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.510 align:start position:0%
 
instead

01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
instead
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if there's currently in
 
01:17:04.629 --> 01:17:04.639 align:start position:0%
statute the ability to hold a special
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
election for some of these municipal
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
offices should they become vacant but
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
the special election would happen like
 
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
there would be a special election but it
 
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
would happen because it would happen at
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
the next town meeting um so when the
 
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
election of officers happens so um let's
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
say it's a select board and um someone
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
resigns with a year left on their term
 
01:17:27.629 --> 01:17:27.639 align:start position:0%
there would be a special election um
 
01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
that you know would happen at the next
 
01:17:31.149 --> 01:17:31.159 align:start position:0%
town meeting to fill out the rest of the
 
01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
term for the last year of it
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
um however there are times where
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
especially where you have a board of
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
Selectmen where it's three people um you
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
you don't want um you don't want only
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
two people on that board right because
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
then it requires you know you have one
 
01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
person get sick or injured or couldn't
 
01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
make a meeting now you're not able to
 
01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
make a quorum and your board of
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
Selectmen essentially would not be able
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
to find function so um there's a benefit
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
to filling these vacancies before the
 
01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
special election but no matter what a
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
special election is going to happen um
 
01:18:04.629 --> 01:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not you fill the
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
vacancy so I hope that answers your
 
01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
um with regards to special elections do
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
you know for sure if Municipal
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities have special elections
 
01:18:27.189 --> 01:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
not in the sense like the legislature
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
does where one of the towns will say you
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
know there's an opening on this you know
 
01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
for our legislative seat and we're
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
requesting a special election and then
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
you have a special election that's set
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
you know on a very it could be you know
 
01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
that's set by the Secretary of State but
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
there is a special election that
 
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
happens after um like for example I I
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
filled the vacancy of a library Board of
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
Trustees seat um previously taking this
 
01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:53.239 align:start position:0%
role and there was a special election to
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
fill out the last year of that term
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
so it's typically you fill the vacancy
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
or you leave it open and then at the
 
01:19:01.629 --> 01:19:01.639 align:start position:0%
next town meeting you elect someone to
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
fill out the rest of the vacancy um yeah
 
01:19:07.950 --> 01:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
I just I'm hesitating because using the
 
01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
term special election is a little
 
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
confusing I agree yeah okay so I did
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
have a question with regards to budget
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
committee memberships so um in your
 
01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
opinion and I'm just zoning in on budget
 
01:19:23.310 --> 01:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
committee because I was a member of a
 
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District budg budget
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
committee do you feel that this language
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
um is sufficient for the case where like
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
I said a budget committee is cooperative
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
and the committee membership is
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
comprised of more than one town is is is
 
01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
this language sufficient to to address
 
01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
that type of a case um in my reading the
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
statute cited is not the statute for um
 
01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District budget
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
committees so that would
 
01:19:55.629 --> 01:19:55.639 align:start position:0%
be an Omission in the bill
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
it it's just not
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
included thank
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
you so that was the last pink card that
 
01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:12.110 align:start position:0%
you so that was the last pink card that
I

01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
have so I will ask is there anyone
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
present who wishes to speak on the bill
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
who has not yet had the opportunity to
 
01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
do so seeing none the chair recognizes
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman to report out the
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
blue sheets thank thank you madam shair
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh on the remote sign in there were four
 
01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
in support and 140 as
 
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
opposed thank you and with that the
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.639 --> 01:21:23.550 align:start position:0%
 
closed

01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
so we are a little bit behind
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
schedule yes we are um at this time the
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
chair will open the public hearing on a
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
proposed non- gerine amendment number
 
01:22:25.709 --> 01:22:25.719 align:start position:0%
2025 -
 
01:22:29.310 --> 01:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
0153 to House Bill 125 enabling
 
01:22:31.709 --> 01:22:31.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities to tax standing wood and
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
Timber on land used for carbon
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
sequestration this amendment prohibits
 
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
the placement of land owned by the
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
county or state and land in trusts that
 
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
receive Public Funding from being
 
01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
enrolled in carbon sequestration
 
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
open good morning thank you Madam chair
 
01:22:58.350 --> 01:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Arnold Davis I
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
represent Coos District 2 I'm from Maron
 
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thank you for hearing my
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
testimony here today I am here to
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
introduce this non gerain amendment to
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
123 this bill is this amendment is
 
01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
actually very simple it prohibits County
 
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
and state lands in any lands that
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
receive Public
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
Funding from being entered into the cin
 
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.510 align:start position:0%
Funding from being entered into the cin
sequestration

01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
sequestration
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
program these properties were purchased
 
01:23:32.229 --> 01:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
with tax dollars and intended for
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
traditional uses putting these lands
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
into Carin projects could disqualify
 
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
them from some of these uses in which
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
they were intended
 
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
for we may hear testimony today claiming
 
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
that the state does not want to give up
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
potential possible Revenue in the future
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
they they have not entered into cin
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
projects before they're not doing any
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
now so if this is something that
 
01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
potentially could be done in the future
 
01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
I believe it would be prudent to revisit
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
this at that time for now I believe we
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
should bring stability to the timber
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
industry and to the wood products
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
industry of New
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh there's there's something
 
01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.629 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh there's there's something
called

01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
called
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
additionality so if the premise behind
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
this whole cin sequestration program is
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
to save trees and lessen greenhouse gas
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
emissions to slow down global warming
 
01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:27.639 align:start position:0%
then counting trees that are not going
 
01:24:30.189 --> 01:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
to be cut anyways disqualifies them from
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
cbin projects one example would be if
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
there's a conservation easement that
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
does not allow you to cut the trees
 
01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:40.280 align:start position:0%
anyways this this type of property would
 
01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:42.790 align:start position:0%
anyways this this type of property would
not

01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
qualify so th this is different than
 
01:24:48.189 --> 01:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
private land owners have rights we're
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
not trying to infringe upon that but
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
public lands paid for with tax dollars
 
01:24:56.109 --> 01:24:56.119 align:start position:0%
should be viewed differently the public
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
Forest should be managed at a high
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
standard best forestry practices not
 
01:25:04.109 --> 01:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
just for the woods Product Industry but
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
also for economic development for
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
wildlife habitat for the prevention of
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
forest fires and and for the the health
 
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
Recreation um before I before I open up
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
for questions I I just have like kind of
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
an FYI this is the second carbon bill
 
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
you you guys have heard in a week uh
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
does this whole premise is about about
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
sequestering carbon out of the
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
atmosphere does anybody here know what
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
the percentage of carbon that's in the
 
01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:38.830 align:start position:0%
the percentage of carbon that's in the
atmosphere

01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
atmosphere
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
today would would you believe me if I
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
said it's less than half a
 
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
percent okay so that's that's what the
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
big fear is here now it's a low number
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
but it's significant I'm not trying to
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
trying to make light of it if uh 12,000
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
years ago we were where we're standing
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
today was under ice that that number was
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
lower so moving that number just a
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
little bit does
 
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
matter so this whole carbon uh premise
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
is this state is 84% forested we do a
 
01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
very good job of managing it for a lot
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
of different
 
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
reasons I I just don't like the idea
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
that California the compliance
 
01:26:25.950 --> 01:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
Market will will continue to pollute at
 
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
the same rate by purchasing credits that
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
are actually making us manage our forest
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
in a a new way that I I don't believe is
 
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the state and so with that
 
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'd open up for questions other
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor seeing none thank you oh oh
 
01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
sorry no representative majorities it
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
might be more thank you madam chairwoman
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
it might be more of a question for for
 
01:26:57.070 --> 01:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
you I'm just trying to understand
 
01:26:59.709 --> 01:26:59.719 align:start position:0%
process uh this seems like it's a
 
01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
Germain amendment to what we're doing so
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not that it really might matter I'm
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand completely
 
01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
what we are
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
doing thank you for the question
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative so um with regards to um
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
issues like this amendments like this
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's at the determination of the speaker
 
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
and the speaker as well as I believe
 
01:27:25.109 --> 01:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
that the house clerk reviewed the link
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
and um determine that it was non gerain
 
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
I will allow the prime speaker to
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
supplement that explanation no that's
 
01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
your your spot on um the subject matter
 
01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
is similar but it affects different
 
01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.189 align:start position:0%
is similar but it affects different
rsas

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
rsas
 
01:27:44.109 --> 01:27:44.119 align:start position:0%
uh so that's I believe that was the
 
01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
amendment yep F further questions
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
you at this time the chair recognizes
 
01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:06.390 align:start position:0%
you at this time the chair recognizes
representative

01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
ulette good morning and welcome to
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
government good morning Madam chair and
 
01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
good morning committee members I'll be
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
very brief U just to expand a little bit
 
01:28:23.790 --> 01:28:23.800 align:start position:0%
on what representative Davis has said I
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
look at it and I think about it we look
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
at franconian Notch Canon Mountain Area
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
I mean that's really a a jewel of New
 
01:28:35.709 --> 01:28:35.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the um Department of forest
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
and lands have done a great job managing
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
that that area keeping it wild keeping
 
01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
open hikers skiers and uh we'll continue
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
to do so so in the carbon SE Quest
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
Station Market if you have a piece of
 
01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
Timberland that has no intention of ever
 
01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.149 align:start position:0%
Timberland that has no intention of ever
being

01:28:55.149 --> 01:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
cut it doesn't qualify for carbon
 
01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
sequesteration and that's a lot of our
 
01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:03.400 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:29:05.950 --> 01:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
lands the other part uh second thing I
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
just want to bring out is land that is
 
01:29:10.990 --> 01:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
managed for carbon sequest station a lot
 
01:29:13.149 --> 01:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
of times it really
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
changes how we look at the land how the
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
land's used because not necessarily a
 
01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
growing uh timber for
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
carbon is compatible with animal habitat
 
01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.470 align:start position:0%
carbon is compatible with animal habitat
and

01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
Recreation um if you do it on your
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
private land that's private land and you
 
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
know we all uh believe that um you
 
01:29:37.149 --> 01:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
should have the freedom to do what you
 
01:29:38.669 --> 01:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
like with your property but when it
 
01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
comes to state land or County Land
 
01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
that's uh bought with public monies um
 
01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:46.590 align:start position:0%
that's uh bought with public monies um
the

01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
traditional uh uses of land when the
 
01:29:50.669 --> 01:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
money was spent and bought for that
 
01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
property should stay
 
01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
intact um that concludes my my uh my
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
statement and I'm open to any questions
 
01:29:59.310 --> 01:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
questions I have a question um so you I
 
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
heard you say that the carbon
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
sequestration program affects how the
 
01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.109 align:start position:0%
sequestration program affects how the
the

01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
forests they they are managed but you
 
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
also I heard you say this carbon
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
sequestration program also affects how
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
these um forests are used so could you
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
you just expound upon the what the
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
impact would be for state-owned forests
 
01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
and how they would uh how that would
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
impact the use of the forests for for
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
like the public oh sure absolutely thank
 
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
you um a lot of the traditional uses in
 
01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
our forest of course is
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
hunting and when we're growing carbon
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
for sequest station our main goal is to
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
grow as much wood as fast as we can so
 
01:30:59.229 --> 01:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
different species grow at different
 
01:31:02.669 --> 01:31:02.679 align:start position:0%
rates different species of animals have
 
01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
habitat in different species of wood and
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
they're not always the same fast growing
 
01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
species is the best habitat or
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
compatible habitat for our our animals
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
so if you are growing a certain species
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
of wood to get as much carbon as you can
 
01:31:21.629 --> 01:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
um uh a very
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
desert likee um habitat for the animals
 
01:31:29.709 --> 01:31:29.719 align:start position:0%
there won't be animals there because
 
01:31:31.149 --> 01:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
they don't produce the feed that they
 
01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
need so that's that's one way where you
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
know growing isn't compatible with um
 
01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
uses representative
 
01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair can you
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
please explain to
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
me what it is about about using a forest
 
01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
for carbon
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
sequestration that in fact prevents it
 
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
from being used for recreation and other
 
01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:07.400 align:start position:0%
uses again thank you for your question
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
it's kind of twofold again uh looking at
 
01:32:13.709 --> 01:32:13.719 align:start position:0%
some of the um traditional uses like I
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
just explained with hunting and and
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
losing some of the habitat but the
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
second part of it is
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
um in
 
01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
most uh situations a lot of situations
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
we've seen around the country the use of
 
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
motorized Motorsports in uh carbon
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
sequest station is almost a conflict of
 
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
philosophies you know they're growing
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
the carbon to keep help the environment
 
01:32:41.229 --> 01:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
but at the same time they don't want uh
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
gas powered engines in that area so it's
 
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh it can be a conflict as far as uh
 
01:32:50.350 --> 01:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:51.870 align:start position:0%
 
Sports

01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
Sports
 
01:32:54.270 --> 01:32:54.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for answering answer my
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
question just a brief followup so in
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
fact there's really nothing about using
 
01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
a forest for carbon
 
01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:05.560 align:start position:0%
sequestration that conflicts with using
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
a forest for recreational purposes
 
01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
unless you restrict some kind of
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
recreational purpose I guess I'm trying
 
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
to get at you know what what is it
 
01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
really that's different about a forest
 
01:33:17.709 --> 01:33:17.719 align:start position:0%
of standing
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
trees that's used for carbon
 
01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
sequesteration and any other Forest
 
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
thank you again for your question um
 
01:33:29.950 --> 01:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
again on the motorized side it's kind of
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
a philos philosophical thing but on the
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
animal habitat thing it's not um as a
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
general rule the best uh animal habitat
 
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
for our deer and some of our smaller
 
01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
game is in the young Forest because
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of feed when you have an
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
a a a mature Forest that's not being cut
 
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
because of growing carbon you have large
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
canopies and there's no light getting to
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
the ground underneath and there's no
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
feed for the animals so a traditional
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
use in New Hampshire which I mean
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
there's hundreds of thousands of hunters
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
that um it's possible that that land
 
01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
would not
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
hunters representative
 
01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
grund thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um so when a
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
contract is made by a town to purchase a
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
piece of
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
land does the contract typically stay
 
01:34:33.390 --> 01:34:33.400 align:start position:0%
what the continued use of the land would
 
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
be or does it just State purchase price
 
01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
and ident identify the trative land um
 
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
or does a contract not say anything the
 
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
town decides the best use of the land
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your question and
 
01:34:49.229 --> 01:34:49.239 align:start position:0%
this non- derain bill uh excludes Town
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
business so this bill have no effect
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
only deals with counties and
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
state do you have followup yeah so I
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
guess let me clarify so when the town
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
has land right they for this carbon
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
sequestration that we're talking about
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
it might be a town
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
might when the contract was made to
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
purchase that land right from the town
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
like the town purchased it from a person
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
or whatever was the contract stay what
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
the continue do the land would be so the
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
town then needs to follow that or do
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
they get to decide the best could I um
 
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
interject so just to help and to be
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
clear okay count is that that the
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
non-main amendment does not pertain to
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
municip municipalities it's only limited
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
to counties or state
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
forests so it's does that help form your
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you yeah I I was thinking
 
01:35:50.669 --> 01:35:50.679 align:start position:0%
of the original purchase thank
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Colby
 
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm skipping over the
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
county and state and moving into I think
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
what's the sleeper here is the land in
 
01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:09.510 align:start position:0%
what's the sleeper here is the land in
trusts

01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
trusts
 
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
how does this effectively instruct
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
private land owners what to do with
 
01:36:18.239 --> 01:36:19.550 align:start position:0%
private land owners what to do with
their

01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
property in my opinion absolutely not
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:36.270 --> 01:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
Murphy are there any public lands that
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
have been gifted and any of those gifts
 
01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
them I yes we're there has been lands
 
01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
that have been
 
01:36:59.070 --> 01:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
gifted um to the state um and as far as
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions I don't know as far as
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
carbon not that I
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
believe so like land was you know for
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
for hunting or representative Murphy do
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
followup yeah do
 
01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
order representative
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
Davis thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking yet another question
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
um can you foresee some point in the
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
future when forest's Forest use for
 
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
carbon sequestration could coexist
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
nicely with Forest used for
 
01:37:41.310 --> 01:37:41.320 align:start position:0%
recreation and produce a significant
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
amount of revenue for the state that
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
would benefit taxpayers and and does
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
this legislation Forstall that Evolution
 
01:37:57.790 --> 01:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
is it possible it could be possible um
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
but again
 
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
the land that was either bought by the
 
01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:10.360 align:start position:0%
state or given to the state
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
um I look at it is was um done for
 
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
traditional uses or had some
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
restrictions on whatever there was but I
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
think that if the state wanted to uh
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
have a piece to property and
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
um wanted to put it in something that
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't traditional or part of the
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
purchase or or gift then they have the
 
01:38:39.589 --> 01:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
option to come back to this um this body
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
and and uh have it
 
01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
approved additional
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
you very much next the chair recognizes
 
01:39:04.510 --> 01:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
good morning and welcome to Municipal

government good morning for the record
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
I'm Jason stock I'm the executive
 
01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire Timberland
 
01:39:18.990 --> 01:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
Owners Association and
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh the second time in two weeks we've
 
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
come together to talk carbon
 
01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the opportunity to
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
testify we we oppose this we oppose this
 
01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
amendment and let me explain why um last
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
week we had there was a lot of
 
01:39:39.790 --> 01:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
discussion about uh taxes Timber taxes
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
and I provided a copy of our our
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
organization's kind of policy statement
 
01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
kind of the filter that we use when we
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
evaluate policy proposals relative to to
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
Forest carbon
 
01:39:57.550 --> 01:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
um representative Colby hit the nail on
 
01:40:01.470 --> 01:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
the head lines 12 and 13 this shall
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
include any land put into trust which
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
receives any public money from the
 
01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
state when we read that um I immediately
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
called our our attorney and said what
 
01:40:16.589 --> 01:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
does this mean and he said it's a great
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
question people in families put land in
 
01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
trust all the
 
01:40:25.229 --> 01:40:25.239 align:start position:0%
time revocable irre revocable trust you
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
do it as part of your estate plan you
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
have children you want to pass that land
 
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
down to your children or you have a
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
spouse you know you it's it's all part
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
of your personal estate planning you'll
 
01:40:39.589 --> 01:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
put your assets into
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
trust um and so that's when we look at
 
01:40:45.589 --> 01:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
this language there's kind of two fil or
 
01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
two two check offs there one is it in
 
01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
trust sure I put it into trust so my
 
01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
children I can I can do it as part of my
 
01:40:56.589 --> 01:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
estate planning the second piece is any
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
public money from the state any public
 
01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
money so let's say I get a grant from
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
department to do some wildlife habitat
 
01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
management out there I'm going to mow
 
01:41:10.350 --> 01:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
some Fields I'm going to create some
 
01:41:13.589 --> 01:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
whipper will whipper will habitat for
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
for you know a bird that's uh not as
 
01:41:19.709 --> 01:41:19.719 align:start position:0%
abundant as it should be or I'm going to
 
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
get a grant from the New Hampshire
 
01:41:24.589 --> 01:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture to to control
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
some invasive plant species or an
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
invasive bug to help me defay my cost
 
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
that checks box to and so in that in
 
01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
this instance when we look at this bill
 
01:41:40.189 --> 01:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
both boxes are checked and that would
 
01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
prohibit me or my family that land
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
that's in my family trust from enrolling
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
in a forest carbon
 
01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
program um and so in our in our position
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
statement we were very
 
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
clear the a landowner's ability and this
 
01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
is a property rights issue for us here
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
you have a land owner that wants to
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
enter into a private contract with
 
01:42:06.510 --> 01:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
someone that wants to buy an asset on
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
their property in this case carbon the
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
value of those trees is is standing
 
01:42:13.119 --> 01:42:14.629 align:start position:0%
value of those trees is is standing
carbon

01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
um this this as proposed in those
 
01:42:21.149 --> 01:42:21.159 align:start position:0%
instances where it's in a trust and I
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
may have received any money
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
it could be a grant or the state could
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
have purchased a piece of aof way across
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
my property or Department of
 
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation gave me money to pile
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
snow or something who knows I would be
 
01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
prohibited from exercising that property
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
right to enter into a private contract
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
with an entity that wants to purchase my
 
01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
carbon so for that reason we we we
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill um on the issue of
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
public land they can coexist with with
 
01:42:58.109 --> 01:42:58.119 align:start position:0%
Recreation they certainly can coexist
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
and as I testified last week they can
 
01:43:04.270 --> 01:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
coexist with with uh forest forest
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
management albeit the forest management
 
01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:07.709 align:start position:0%
management albeit the forest management
would

01:43:07.709 --> 01:43:07.719 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:43:11.550 --> 01:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
change um we do support we do support
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
the sponsor's intent on that piece and
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
again as I testified last week we have
 
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:20.719 align:start position:0%
members on this issue that are land
 
01:43:23.589 --> 01:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
owners we have members that are also
 
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
loggers Foresters and
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
Sawmills and when we when we evaluated
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
this issue we said look where do we draw
 
01:43:36.270 --> 01:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
the line we recognize property rights
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
that's clear on public land particularly
 
01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
state land um it it's our belief that
 
01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
there were traditional uses when that
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
property was acquired with public money
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
there were traditional uses carbon was
 
01:43:53.350 --> 01:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
not contemplated if it is the desire of
 
01:43:55.629 --> 01:43:55.639 align:start position:0%
the the general court to to start
 
01:43:58.189 --> 01:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
entering you know allowing State Forest
 
01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
to enter into carbon contracts then then
 
01:44:04.350 --> 01:44:04.360 align:start position:0%
cify that in in law but that land was a
 
01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
purchased with with money that was
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
public money with an expectation that
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
that land would be managed for multiple
 
01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:13.719 align:start position:0%
traditional uses that include Recreation
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
and of course Forest Products um the the
 
01:44:19.629 --> 01:44:19.639 align:start position:0%
state lands the the division of forest
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
and lands does a great job managing our
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
forest and
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
that their Timber sales and their
 
01:44:29.310 --> 01:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
forestry are an important source of are
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
an important source of raw ingredient
 
01:44:34.270 --> 01:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
raw material for our Mills across the
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
state and what we would like to avoid is
 
01:44:40.030 --> 01:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
a situation where someone says aha I've
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
got a clever way to plug a budget hole
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
let's take all this state land and and
 
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
roll it into a carbon program and here
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
we go problem solved and so for that
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
reason we thought
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
we we took the position that certainly
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
in the case of State lands that it was
 
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
not appropriate um at this point to just
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
say all right um you know enroll those
 
01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
in or allow those to be enrolled in a
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
carbon program again you're the you're
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
the Arbiter on all of this you're the
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
general court and you can decide at a
 
01:45:16.189 --> 01:45:16.199 align:start position:0%
later date yeah we want go for it let's
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
do some let's do some carbon and let's
 
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
try to to do that but at this point
 
01:45:23.709 --> 01:45:23.719 align:start position:0%
we're of the opinion keep state land and
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
using the traditional uses continue to
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
manage it as we have but um and so with
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
that I'll I'll include I'll conclude my
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm I'm happy to try and
 
01:45:39.310 --> 01:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
answer any questions and I appreciate
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
your patience with this tricky
 
01:45:48.510 --> 01:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
subject thank you questions represented
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
Davis thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question do do you
 
01:45:57.750 --> 01:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
think that this is an not a single issue
 
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
but a whole group of issues that
 
01:46:04.030 --> 01:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
requires a tremendous amount of study
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
from both policy environmental Financial
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders I do and and last week you
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
got a glimpse into the timber tax kind
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the municipal tax piece of it this
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
week you're getting another glimpse into
 
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
kind of public land management and in
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
kind of the kind of bigger picture of
 
01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
Land Management you've heard in
 
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
testimony about kind of the
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
additionality and some of the bigger
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
picture issues about just carbon trading
 
01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
in general California markets private
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
there are private markets out there
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
there are entities out there such as
 
01:46:46.350 --> 01:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
Microsoft that will because of some of
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
their environmental policies and goals
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
will enter into what are called
 
01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary markets this is a big issue
 
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's a new issue um and again as I
 
01:46:59.669 --> 01:46:59.679 align:start position:0%
offered last week representative stavis
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
chairman power I we're willing to work
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
with the committee if you do wish to to
 
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
do a study and take a bigger picture
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
look at this um and we certainly want to
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
work with with the sponsors of the bill
 
01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
and make sure
 
01:47:16.270 --> 01:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
that we can come to some resolution but
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
this is a big big
 
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
issue thank you further questions
 
01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
represent representative Jory thank you
 
01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman and this is a a
 
01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
fascinating topic one that we don't
 
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
typically hear in Municipal and County
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
so it's it's fascinating just to try to
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
understand it which is the nature of my
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
question so I think of the southeast
 
01:47:37.589 --> 01:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
Land Trust uh now which which which has
 
01:47:39.950 --> 01:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
Forest which were purchase through
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
grants do I understand correctly that
 
01:47:44.589 --> 01:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
that to the best of your knowledge they
 
01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
could not enter into that voluntary
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
currently they can they can yeah and in
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
and in fact last week there was there is
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
a registry at the in the state of New
 
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of you know so if you enter
 
01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:09.159 align:start position:0%
into a carbon program you that land gets
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
that land gets enrolled in a registry at
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
the division of forest and lands and
 
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
there are there are some land there I
 
01:48:18.189 --> 01:48:18.199 align:start position:0%
believe there are two land trust
 
01:48:20.589 --> 01:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
currently in that registry right now I
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
think it's bear with me I think it's
 
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
peek Lakes Region conservation trust um
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
is is one of them so there there are
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
there are land trusts that can can
 
01:48:42.189 --> 01:48:42.199 align:start position:0%
enroll in it um Can enroll case of selt
 
01:48:42.199 --> 01:48:43.430 align:start position:0%
enroll in it um Can enroll case of selt
um

01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
madok um nonprofits can now again coming
 
01:48:51.310 --> 01:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
back to the bill if that land were in
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
some some way shap perform in a
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
trust however you define what is a trust
 
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
if that parcel is in a trust and there
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
was public any public money part of
 
01:49:06.669 --> 01:49:06.679 align:start position:0%
either the transaction or part of the
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
stewardship work that's occurring on the
 
01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
property if this non- gerain amendment
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:21.629 --> 01:49:21.639 align:start position:0%
Eligibility thank you're welcome
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative stavis
 
01:49:25.870 --> 01:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
taking another question uh is it your
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
understanding that the um New Hampshire
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
old growth forest Network would be
 
01:49:37.390 --> 01:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
eligible to enroll in a carbon
 
01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:39.629 align:start position:0%
eligible to enroll in a carbon
sequestration

01:49:39.629 --> 01:49:39.639 align:start position:0%
sequestration
 
01:49:42.430 --> 01:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
program I'm not familiar
 
01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
with with that um if it's an
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
organization or if it's a land owner I
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not I I can't speak to that um what
 
01:49:54.149 --> 01:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
I do know is the way many of these
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
carbon contracts do work is there is a
 
01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
purchase of standing carbon so an
 
01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:02.719 align:start position:0%
inventory is
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
done the existing carbon that's on the
 
01:50:09.629 --> 01:50:09.639 align:start position:0%
property is valued and and purchased and
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
then there's subsequent growth that will
 
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
get that will get sold at future dates
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
depending on tree
 
01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
growth and so I don't know if the The
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
Entity that you're mentioning is in fact
 
01:50:28.270 --> 01:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
a land trust but if they do have if
 
01:50:30.189 --> 01:50:30.199 align:start position:0%
they're a private entity that owns Real
 
01:50:32.430 --> 01:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
Estate Old growth or otherwise and
 
01:50:34.830 --> 01:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm raising this there is
 
01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities to participate
 
01:50:40.069 --> 01:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:42.910 --> 01:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
markets further
 
01:50:47.229 --> 01:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
you next the chair calls Ms Meredith
 
01:50:50.719 --> 01:50:55.310 align:start position:0%
you next the chair calls Ms Meredith
Hatfield

01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
good morning and welcome to Municipal
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
and County government thank you madam
 
01:51:01.149 --> 01:51:01.159 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee Meredith
 
01:51:04.109 --> 01:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
Hatfield for The Nature Conservancy um
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
you heard from us last week uh on the
 
01:51:08.709 --> 01:51:08.719 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill uh where we raised
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
concerns and we also have concerns with
 
01:51:14.109 --> 01:51:14.119 align:start position:0%
this proposed amendment um many of which
 
01:51:15.790 --> 01:51:15.800 align:start position:0%
uh have already been raised so I won't
 
01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
repeat them um but we do believe that um
 
01:51:21.629 --> 01:51:21.639 align:start position:0%
participating in a forest carbon Market
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
can coexist exist with a lot of
 
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
traditional uses and we've actually seen
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh the folks at the state level who are
 
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
charged with uh protecting and managing
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
our state lands do a really good job of
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
making sure that they have the ability
 
01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
to do what they need to do on our state
 
01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
lands so we would urge you to not um
 
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
hamstring counties or uh state agencies
 
01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
from having options for a variety of
 
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
ways of managing lands we we think it
 
01:51:53.669 --> 01:51:53.679 align:start position:0%
actually wouldn't be wor able to come
 
01:51:56.669 --> 01:51:56.679 align:start position:0%
back to the legislature if there was an
 
01:52:00.270 --> 01:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so and to have to seek
 
01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
specific legislation in that instance um
 
01:52:06.669 --> 01:52:06.679 align:start position:0%
and we also as I said last week we do
 
01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
think this is a very complicated issue
 
01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
and that it probably would benefit from
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh further study and
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
investigation um and lastly um I'll say
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
again you know we we are very
 
01:52:21.149 --> 01:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to uh the concerns in the
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
North Country around um the Connecticut
 
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:27.719 align:start position:0%
Lakes Headwaters which um seems to have
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh inspired a lot of this legislation
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
and the future of the forest products
 
01:52:34.510 --> 01:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
industry so we think that also merits
 
01:52:37.109 --> 01:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
attention um from all of us in this Nate
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh not just folks in the North Country
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there
 
01:52:46.750 --> 01:52:46.760 align:start position:0%

we took no position on the underlying
 
01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
Bill and nor do we have one but we are
 
01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
opposed to to this amendment and uh it's
 
01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
it's already been mentioned but that
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
that sentence in lines uh 12 and 13
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
shall not include any land put into
 
01:53:46.990 --> 01:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
trust which receives any public money
 
01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
state any public money from the state um
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
there's there's farm and Forest land all
 
01:53:58.430 --> 01:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
over the state that is under an
 
01:54:02.069 --> 01:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
easement that may or may not be but uh
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
may be uh under in a
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
trust and anybody who understands
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
conservation easements they often
 
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
requires money being cobbled together
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
from all kinds of sources including
 
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
State the way this reads as well it says
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to it says that um which
 
01:54:23.709 --> 01:54:23.719 align:start position:0%
receives any public money from the state
 
01:54:25.629 --> 01:54:25.639 align:start position:0%
well what about Federal money that goes
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
to the state and then dispersed that way
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
is that is that included it's a question
 
01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
know I
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
think I think what in in listening to
 
01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:42.750 align:start position:0%
think I think what in in listening to
representative

01:54:42.750 --> 01:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:45.870 --> 01:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
ducet in answering the questions it
 
01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
appears to me that he's reading that
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
last sentence to say this should include
 
01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
any land put into public trust is my
 
01:54:58.510 --> 01:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
says we strongly believe that that land
 
01:55:06.030 --> 01:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
owners uh private land
 
01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:09.350 align:start position:0%
owners uh private land
owners

01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
um they well the that option is valuable
 
01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
to to to to to enter the carbon Market
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
that I guess in closing i' just like to
 
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
point out another example is just think
 
01:55:26.910 --> 01:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
about it a I'm a I'm a a private land
 
01:55:30.430 --> 01:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
owner I've I've uh put my my property
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
into a trust for various reasons and I
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't think I have to explain those and
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
I have uh been approached by uh an
 
01:55:41.669 --> 01:55:41.679 align:start position:0%
entity that would like to put a trail a
 
01:55:43.950 --> 01:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
public use Trail through my property and
 
01:55:46.109 --> 01:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
I say sure in their in their state funds
 
01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
are go to that that now prohibits me
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
from participating in a in a carbon
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
Market that's just not right
 
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
Z thank you for your attention I'll
 
01:55:59.390 --> 01:55:59.400 align:start position:0%

we are in support of this amendment
 
01:56:23.069 --> 01:56:23.079 align:start position:0%
representative Davis's other amend to
 
01:56:26.069 --> 01:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
have a yield tax on carbon tonnage and
 
01:56:28.350 --> 01:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
um I won't rehash some of the things
 
01:56:31.390 --> 01:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
that have been discussed with some of
 
01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
the concerns with the amendment um from
 
01:56:35.470 --> 01:56:35.480 align:start position:0%
some other stakeholders we're going to
 
01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
have a meeting later today to kind of
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
you know discuss more in depth how
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
exactly we want to deal with this issue
 
01:56:43.629 --> 01:56:43.639 align:start position:0%
but um the the issue is is that the
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
state may gain revenues from entering
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
into these types of lease agreements um
 
01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
to allow carbon sequestration but it
 
01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:52.830 align:start position:0%
to allow carbon sequestration but it
does

01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
um at the municipalities detriment in
 
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
their local taxpayers and the local
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
Timber industry by not by not
 
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
incentivizing the reasonable cutting of
 
01:57:04.109 --> 01:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
Timber um there is no collection of the
 
01:57:06.149 --> 01:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
yield tax by the municipalities and some
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities such as Pittsburgh each
 
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
year 5 to 10% of their budget is funded
 
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
with Timber tax um the reason for this
 
01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
kind of this um carbon sequestration
 
01:57:18.430 --> 01:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
industry existing is because the tax
 
01:57:20.510 --> 01:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
schemes in other states and countries
 
01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
that are kind of creating this new
 
01:57:24.030 --> 01:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
artificial industry and ultimately it'll
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
hurt municipalities unless
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities are able to tax the
 
01:57:29.870 --> 01:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
carbon tonnage and be able to recoup
 
01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
those loss revenues from the timber tax
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
and also there's a trickle down effect
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
where the timber industry um
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
disproportionately in the North Country
 
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
Carol County or Grafton County um where
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
they're going to lose um they're going
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
to lose their own business uh revenues
 
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
um once you start cutting Timber as stop
 
01:57:50.669 --> 01:57:50.679 align:start position:0%
cutting Timber as much um there's just
 
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
less productivity in the entire industry
 
01:57:56.030 --> 01:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
that depends on the uh Timber cutting um
 
01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
as was previously stated by our
 
01:57:59.430 --> 01:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
organization and I'll restate it again
 
01:58:02.589 --> 01:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
RSA 79 colon 5 which currently is you
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
know the existing statute that tries to
 
01:58:07.149 --> 01:58:07.159 align:start position:0%
deal with the loss of Timber revenues is
 
01:58:08.910 --> 01:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
um unworkable and we wouldn't recommend
 
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
that municipalities utilize that statute
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
to try to um to try to gain um tax
 
01:58:17.950 --> 01:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
revenue via credits for uncut Timber um
 
01:58:20.229 --> 01:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
standing Timber it's too ambiguous the
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
way it's written is based on general tax
 
01:58:25.629 --> 01:58:25.639 align:start position:0%
based on um previous laws so it wouldn't
 
01:58:28.109 --> 01:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
solve the issue um solving the issue is
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
taxing the carbon tonnage as a yield tax
 
01:58:34.069 --> 01:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
under the existing Timber tax RSA 79 and
 
01:58:37.069 --> 01:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
I'm helping municipalities um be able to
 
01:58:38.910 --> 01:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
preserve this Revenue source that helps
 
01:58:42.589 --> 01:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
their property taxpayers thank you are
 
01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:44.840 align:start position:0%

01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:47.390 align:start position:0%

amendment seeing none thank you thank
 
01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:52.750 align:start position:0%
amendment seeing none thank you thank

it's um good to be here my name is Bill

and Pignatelli with in the conquered
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
office our client is Aurora sustainable
 
01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
lands Aurora is the entity that is the
 
01:59:32.910 --> 01:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
current private owner of the connetic
 
01:59:35.870 --> 01:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lake Headwater Forest
 
01:59:39.470 --> 01:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
146,000 Acres a very important land for
 
01:59:41.149 --> 01:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire for the North
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
country and for all of those in uh who
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
use that precious property we I am here
 
01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
today to testify in
 
01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
opposition to this non Germain Amendment
 
01:59:56.910 --> 01:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
the reasons have been stated uh
 
02:00:01.149 --> 02:00:01.159 align:start position:0%
representative Colby was dead-on correct
 
02:00:04.629 --> 02:00:04.639 align:start position:0%
with the question what does that second
 
02:00:09.790 --> 02:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
sentence mean if this bill only applies
 
02:00:12.990 --> 02:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
to land that is owned directly or
 
02:00:17.550 --> 02:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
indirectly by the state or a County
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
government my client has no immediate
 
02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
concern concern with that however if you
 
02:00:28.069 --> 02:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
look at the lack of clarity in that
 
02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
second sentence one of the most poorly
 
02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
drafted unclear sentences which involves
 
02:00:36.910 --> 02:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
very significant Stakes we don't know
 
02:00:40.830 --> 02:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
what the word this means we don't know
 
02:00:43.470 --> 02:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
it may be as the sponsors and
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
representatives indicated oh no this
 
02:00:48.430 --> 02:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
refers to the first sentence which means
 
02:00:51.390 --> 02:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
only state own land if that's the case
 
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
again Aurora need not be directly
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
involved in this particular issue um
 
02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
include land put in a trust what kind of
 
02:01:05.669 --> 02:01:05.679 align:start position:0%
trust in fact Aurora owns the
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes Headwater Forest
 
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
through a special form of trust which
 
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
got us here to the table to bring
 
02:01:16.189 --> 02:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
testimony to your committee on this
 
02:01:19.390 --> 02:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment um receiving public
 
02:01:22.510 --> 02:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
money from the state uh Mr stock and and
 
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
others who testified pointed this out
 
02:01:27.069 --> 02:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
it's unclear what that means I grew up
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
in Cornish New Hampshire on a farm uh my
 
02:01:33.629 --> 02:01:33.639 align:start position:0%
parents who passed away owned the farm
 
02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
in trust they had the uh much of the
 
02:01:41.589 --> 02:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
forest land enrolled in current use it's
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
and they received grants my parents did
 
02:01:47.310 --> 02:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
and I helped them with it uh on various
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
cases for agricultural grants and others
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
does this a
 
02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
apply to that Family Farm now I'm
 
02:01:59.310 --> 02:01:59.320 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself here not Aurora but
 
02:02:01.870 --> 02:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
it would be many many many other private
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
owners as has been testified to one
 
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
thing that hasn't been testified to is
 
02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
if the legislature were to
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
try to write this correctly to apply
 
02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
apply to private owned property that
 
02:02:21.149 --> 02:02:21.159 align:start position:0%
where private owners have the right to
 
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
decide to hire Harvest Timber they have
 
02:02:26.189 --> 02:02:26.199 align:start position:0%
the right to let people on for tourism
 
02:02:29.310 --> 02:02:29.320 align:start position:0%
uses they have many ways of earning
 
02:02:32.669 --> 02:02:32.679 align:start position:0%
income uh it Aurora does but so do
 
02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
private land owners and one of those may
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
be this developing carbon sequestration
 
02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
system out there another way to get
 
02:02:45.669 --> 02:02:45.679 align:start position:0%
income from your private ownership of
 
02:02:48.270 --> 02:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
private property the constitution of
 
02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
this state and the Federal Constitution
 
02:02:56.589 --> 02:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
prohibits governments from taking
 
02:02:58.830 --> 02:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
private property either directly through
 
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
eminent domain or in many cases in one I
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
think this language would point to where
 
02:03:09.149 --> 02:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
it's kind of targeted to a particular
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
format it would prohibit a regulatory
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
taking in other words taking away the
 
02:03:17.950 --> 02:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
right of a private owner to benefit from
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
their private property uh I think that
 
02:03:24.510 --> 02:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
if this language were interpreted to
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
apply to private property you would have
 
02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
another issue that other people who
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
testified haven't brought forward but
 
02:03:32.790 --> 02:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
that it would violate the federal and
 
02:03:34.510 --> 02:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
state constitution New Hampshire has one
 
02:03:37.750 --> 02:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
of the strongest protections for private
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
property rights in the country and we
 
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
just had an amendment a number of years
 
02:03:46.030 --> 02:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
back uh that strengthened that even more
 
02:03:48.589 --> 02:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
i' finally close with and be happy to
 
02:03:52.549 --> 02:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
take questions that Aurora my client
 
02:03:56.709 --> 02:03:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh continues to manage its property this
 
02:04:00.430 --> 02:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
very precious property consistent with
 
02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
the terms and the spirit of the
 
02:04:04.669 --> 02:04:04.679 align:start position:0%
conservation easement with the state of
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we work with the state of
 
02:04:10.270 --> 02:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire regular regularly we uh
 
02:04:12.669 --> 02:04:12.679 align:start position:0%
and trying to get the stewardship plan
 
02:04:14.629 --> 02:04:14.639 align:start position:0%
finished we're working on that we work
 
02:04:18.030 --> 02:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders we are very happy to
 
02:04:20.310 --> 02:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
have Timber harvesting continue on the
 
02:04:22.589 --> 02:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
property even though it's been enrolled
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
in a carbon program since
 
02:04:27.790 --> 02:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
2013 and it's been the fact that it's
 
02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
been enrolled has been in the existing
 
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
state stewardship plan uh there's been
 
02:04:35.310 --> 02:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
harvesting going on regularly uh of
 
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
Timber since that time period subject to
 
02:04:41.830 --> 02:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
important things like weather and
 
02:04:45.310 --> 02:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
markets weather has been very tough up
 
02:04:48.149 --> 02:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
there recently with entire Road systems
 
02:04:51.310 --> 02:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
washed out and with warmer you know this
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
winter we've got a frozen pack in in our
 
02:04:56.990 --> 02:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
in my family's property when you had
 
02:04:59.470 --> 02:04:59.480 align:start position:0%
Frozen land that was the time to do the
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
harvesting we've got frozen land but our
 
02:05:04.030 --> 02:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
roads have been washed out up there so I
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of reasons to go in
 
02:05:08.430 --> 02:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
but we are continuing to harvest up
 
02:05:10.430 --> 02:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
there consistent with the terms of the
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
easement we are also very supportive of
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
Tourism efforts of motorized vehicles uh
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
of hunting and of preserving the
 
02:05:24.030 --> 02:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
incredible quality of that forest for
 
02:05:28.270 --> 02:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
wildlife for um the environment and and
 
02:05:31.470 --> 02:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh and we intend to continue to do so
 
02:05:33.549 --> 02:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we're here is just to
 
02:05:35.229 --> 02:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
let you know how much a partner we
 
02:05:37.030 --> 02:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
intend to be with the state of New
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we but we expect that the
 
02:05:43.229 --> 02:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
state will continue to work with us as a
 
02:05:45.149 --> 02:05:45.159 align:start position:0%
private owner consistent with private
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
property rights and I'd be happy to
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you thank you
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
you the last pink card that I have here
 
02:06:05.709 --> 02:06:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
Ley good morning and welcome to
 
02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government good
 
02:06:12.510 --> 02:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
morning thank you uh for the record I'm
 
02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
Matt Ley I'm the public policy director
 
02:06:16.549 --> 02:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
for the Society of protection of New
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Forest uh we also oppose this
 
02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
amendment and we do that
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
knowing as you've heard from some of the
 
02:06:28.430 --> 02:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
previous speakers the concerns about
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
these Forest carbon markets uh
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
specifically the loss of uh tax revenue
 
02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:35.629 align:start position:0%
specifically the loss of uh tax revenue
to

02:06:35.629 --> 02:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:06:37.950 --> 02:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities um so we understand that
 
02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
but you know the force Society also
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
views these um Forest carbon projects as
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
just a another tool that a forest land
 
02:06:51.069 --> 02:06:51.079 align:start position:0%
owner could use to help them better
 
02:06:55.069 --> 02:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
manage their forc resources so it's um
 
02:06:59.470 --> 02:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
again it's it's a tool um um so you know
 
02:07:03.069 --> 02:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
our concern with the amendment is to
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
have you know first a blanket
 
02:07:08.030 --> 02:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
prohibition as it would apply to um
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
State and County Properties but probably
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
more of concerning to us and we are a
 
02:07:17.950 --> 02:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
private non-profit land trust that one
 
02:07:19.870 --> 02:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
sentence that's been discussed I mean we
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
certainly view that um as impacting
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
private Forest land owners that's a
 
02:07:30.589 --> 02:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
concern um so again you know the issue
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
of force carbon Force management
 
02:07:38.910 --> 02:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
is very complex you could literally talk
 
02:07:42.549 --> 02:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
for days and weeks about this subject
 
02:07:45.870 --> 02:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
um and so I you know again I you know
 
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
what's being proposed we just think is
 
02:07:52.149 --> 02:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
um sort of
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
overreach about the current level of
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
forest land that's actually enrolled in
 
02:08:00.990 --> 02:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in these Forest uh markets
 
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
the um State of New Hampshire division
 
02:08:05.669 --> 02:08:05.679 align:start position:0%
of forest lands does have a carbon
 
02:08:08.430 --> 02:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
registry and I think there's seven or
 
02:08:10.709 --> 02:08:10.719 align:start position:0%
eight properties that are enrolled
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
totally about 180,000 Acres 140,000 of
 
02:08:18.189 --> 02:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
those acres is one project so I just
 
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
think as we're trying to figure out a
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
way to be fair to municipalities who may
 
02:08:26.310 --> 02:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
be losing revenue from these deals that
 
02:08:30.629 --> 02:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
we don't go too far in the other
 
02:08:32.549 --> 02:08:32.559 align:start position:0%
direction and actually end up
 
02:08:36.069 --> 02:08:36.079 align:start position:0%
prohibiting um the you know um decisions
 
02:08:38.189 --> 02:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
that a a forest ler may want to take to
 
02:08:40.149 --> 02:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
help them manage their Forest recess so
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
again we oppose the amendment but I'm
 
02:08:43.229 --> 02:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
02:08:47.069 --> 02:08:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you great
 
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you so that is the final pink card
 
02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
that I have is there anyone present who
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak on this bill who has not
 
02:09:01.229 --> 02:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
yet had the opportunity to do so so
 
02:09:03.470 --> 02:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will recognize
 
02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:05.360 align:start position:0%

blue sheets thank you m Madam chair um
 
02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:11.520 align:start position:0%

support and 35 in opposition on today's
 
02:09:17.709 --> 02:09:17.719 align:start position:0%
blue sheet we have three in support and
 
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:19.520 align:start position:0%

02:09:54.549 --> 02:09:54.559 align:start position:0%
I will open the public hearing on House
 
02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 490 relative to indemnification for
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities adopting policies to
 
02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:02.030 align:start position:0%
municipalities adopting policies to
address

02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:10:04.350 --> 02:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
homelessness the chair recognizes
 
02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative Howard to introduce the
 
02:10:09.910 --> 02:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
bill and I um appreciate your patience
 
02:10:12.510 --> 02:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
as we are behind schedule thank you
 
02:10:14.350 --> 02:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman uh no worries I'll make
 
02:10:16.510 --> 02:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
it quick for everybody uh and also thank
 
02:10:19.149 --> 02:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
you honorable committee members uh
 
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
homelessness has been a growing problem
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
in New New Hampshire and HP 490 is
 
02:10:25.589 --> 02:10:25.599 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that gives
 
02:10:27.589 --> 02:10:27.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities additional tools to
 
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
combat this issue the problem the bill
 
02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
is pretty simple uh as we all like to
 
02:10:36.589 --> 02:10:36.599 align:start position:0%
say uh as it just removes liability from
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
Municipal properties being used as
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
shelters right now under current law if
 
02:10:42.990 --> 02:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
a shelter were to be set up by a
 
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
municipality in a space that was not
 
02:10:47.390 --> 02:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
fully suitable there are a number of
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
potential lawsuits that could arise for
 
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
example if a space did not have the
 
02:10:54.549 --> 02:10:54.559 align:start position:0%
proper bathroom facilities or there was
 
02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
not proper snow removal compare that to
 
02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
their current living situation of uh the
 
02:11:02.709 --> 02:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
woods or in people's backyards or on the
 
02:11:05.069 --> 02:11:05.079 align:start position:0%
street and this is far more
 
02:11:07.950 --> 02:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
preferable municipalities want to help
 
02:11:09.149 --> 02:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
people get off the street but they are
 
02:11:11.069 --> 02:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
worried about the potential consequences
 
02:11:14.830 --> 02:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
of a lawsuit the worry that they have is
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
completely valid because whether it is
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
an ambulance Chaser or a legitimate
 
02:11:21.790 --> 02:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
claim money that was not available to
 
02:11:23.390 --> 02:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
upgrade or fix these shelters in the
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
first place would be redirected to any
 
02:11:28.549 --> 02:11:28.559 align:start position:0%
damaged party under this bill legal
 
02:11:30.350 --> 02:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
action against municipalities has to
 
02:11:33.589 --> 02:11:33.599 align:start position:0%
prove that they were Beyond neglectful
 
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh and act with a conscious disregard
 
02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
for the safety of others as long as
 
02:11:40.990 --> 02:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities are trying to do the
 
02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
right thing they will be protected if we
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
can pass this bill we can do a lot of
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
good help a lot of people and open more
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
shelter all through local control thank
 
02:11:57.950 --> 02:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative um
 
02:12:02.669 --> 02:12:02.679 align:start position:0%
representative Colby is recognized for a
 
02:12:04.430 --> 02:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair thank you
 
02:12:07.270 --> 02:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative Howard uh the majority of
 
02:12:10.589 --> 02:12:10.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities have um Hazard mitigation
 
02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
plans uh these plans define specific
 
02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
public buildings that can be used as
 
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
temporary shelters um I noticed the term
 
02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
temporary shelter uh being added here
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
would this also benefit
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and indemnify them
 
02:12:26.639 --> 02:12:27.830 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and indemnify them
through

02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:12:30.149 --> 02:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
using yeah I mean that that's a good
 
02:12:32.709 --> 02:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
point uh if I'm not mistaken in order to
 
02:12:34.990 --> 02:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
be eligible for FEMA funding uh we
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
actually have to have some of these uh
 
02:12:40.510 --> 02:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh things covered uh and make sure that
 
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
we actually have shelters available for
 
02:12:45.390 --> 02:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
people in municipalities uh so having
 
02:12:47.470 --> 02:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
this indemnification would really help
 
02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
kind of cover a lot of those bases great
 
02:12:53.350 --> 02:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative Dolan thank you
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh thank you representative
 
02:13:02.189 --> 02:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh this
 
02:13:04.750 --> 02:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
indemnification if if the homeless
 
02:13:09.229 --> 02:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
shelter was set up and it was not per
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
code for fire
 
02:13:15.149 --> 02:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
prevention and in the unfortunate s
 
02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
situation a fire actually occurred and
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
and we had death and and injury as a
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
result would would that still be would
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
they still be indemnified or or not so I
 
02:13:28.189 --> 02:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
I think that there would it would have
 
02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
to be a case by case basis because uh as
 
02:13:34.350 --> 02:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
if you can read uh section three of the
 
02:13:37.470 --> 02:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
bill uh any action to recover damages
 
02:13:39.470 --> 02:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
arising out of uh the appropriate
 
02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
Authority uh C it can be taken up in
 
02:13:46.270 --> 02:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
court as legal action and people can
 
02:13:47.669 --> 02:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
make claims against the municipality
 
02:13:50.109 --> 02:13:50.119 align:start position:0%
just there has to be proof that as I
 
02:13:53.950 --> 02:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
said uh there has to be uh one second I
 
02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
need to find this uh they have to
 
02:14:07.390 --> 02:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:10.750 --> 02:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
to here it is sorry apologies uh legal
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
election against municipalities has to
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
prove that they were Beyond neglectful
 
02:14:16.510 --> 02:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
and act as with conscious disregard for
 
02:14:19.109 --> 02:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
the safety of others so it's the fact
 
02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
that they have to prove that they were
 
02:14:23.589 --> 02:14:23.599 align:start position:0%
Beyond neglectful this means that they
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
were not necessarily uh doing everything
 
02:14:29.549 --> 02:14:29.559 align:start position:0%
that they could to make sure that these
 
02:14:32.510 --> 02:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
properties were uh as up to code as
 
02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
possible and for the most part A lot of
 
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
the buildings that are being used they
 
02:14:40.030 --> 02:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
are completely up to code it's just some
 
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
of the minor things like I had mentioned
 
02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
with Stow removal where if we can get uh
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
if we don't necessarily have the proper
 
02:14:48.669 --> 02:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
St removal out in front of these
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
shelters they can't legally be used uh
 
02:14:53.430 --> 02:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
as there could be potential hazards for
 
02:14:56.709 --> 02:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
like slipping on ice per se uh and if
 
02:14:58.750 --> 02:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
somebody gets injured on our property
 
02:15:01.229 --> 02:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
we're liable so it's just trying to
 
02:15:03.390 --> 02:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
cover those bases so that we can try to
 
02:15:05.470 --> 02:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that as many properties are
 
02:15:07.790 --> 02:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
useful as Pro as possible I don't
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily know if there would be one
 
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
that would be used that wouldn't be up
 
02:15:14.470 --> 02:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
to fire code but on the case that it was
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
I would potentially say uh it it depends
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
on the caseby casee scenario and whether
 
02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
or not there was another shelter
 
02:15:23.589 --> 02:15:23.599 align:start position:0%
available did meet those
 
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
codes representative
 
02:15:28.589 --> 02:15:28.599 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair and thank
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question do you have a
 
02:15:33.790 --> 02:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
definition of Beyond
 
02:15:37.390 --> 02:15:37.400 align:start position:0%
neglect I uh I personally do not I again
 
02:15:40.750 --> 02:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
I think that that's something where uh
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
if I think that the courts need to look
 
02:15:45.549 --> 02:15:45.559 align:start position:0%
at that and kind of determine as I said
 
02:15:48.510 --> 02:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:52.430 --> 02:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
basis additional questions I have a
 
02:15:55.069 --> 02:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
question I would assume that this is not
 
02:15:57.629 --> 02:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
permitted right now um so this is a
 
02:16:01.709 --> 02:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
totally new use for public property my
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
question is um with regards
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
to I understand that this bill would
 
02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
allow municipalities to be able to
 
02:16:13.950 --> 02:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
provide temporary shelter for
 
02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
homeless so that would be food and and
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
housing on public property is there any
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
um Provisions for I guess oversight with
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
regards to health and safety of all of
 
02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
those offerings or
 
02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
Provisions I don't believe that there
 
02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
are necessarily any in in that regard
 
02:16:40.389 --> 02:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
it's just the fact that we do have a
 
02:16:42.309 --> 02:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
number of shelters uh I mean for
 
02:16:43.469 --> 02:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
instance I know that there are some
 
02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
people from straford County we're going
 
02:16:47.150 --> 02:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
to be speaking uh in a little bit about
 
02:16:50.309 --> 02:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
the will and uh warming shelter and kind
 
02:16:53.429 --> 02:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
of the situ that is going on there and I
 
02:16:55.629 --> 02:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
mean that's a real world situation that
 
02:16:57.750 --> 02:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
I think that they could provide a little
 
02:17:00.150 --> 02:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
bit more information as to the need for
 
02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
that uh and kind of what they are doing
 
02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
to provide those services to make sure
 
02:17:07.509 --> 02:17:07.519 align:start position:0%
that people are fed make sure that
 
02:17:08.910 --> 02:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
people have access to the health care
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
that they need uh while they're
 
02:17:14.429 --> 02:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
shelters thank you further
 
02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:19.599 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
02:17:22.349 --> 02:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
02:17:29.150 --> 02:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
Taylor good uh morning and welcome to
 
02:17:33.589 --> 02:17:33.599 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government excent
 
02:17:35.309 --> 02:17:35.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Nick Taylor I'm the
 
02:17:38.870 --> 02:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
director of housing action New Hampshire
 
02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
we are a Statewide organization that
 
02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
advocates for pro housing policy and our
 
02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
members include developers landlords
 
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
lenders property managers homeless
 
02:17:51.509 --> 02:17:51.519 align:start position:0%
shelters and more um we appreciate the
 
02:17:53.750 --> 02:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
intent we don't have a formal position
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
on this bill um and it only really kind
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
of came to our attention recently so I
 
02:17:59.709 --> 02:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
apologize for not having a chance to
 
02:18:01.150 --> 02:18:01.160 align:start position:0%
talk to the sponsor about this either
 
02:18:03.230 --> 02:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
but so we appreciate the intent of what
 
02:18:05.150 --> 02:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here homelessness is
 
02:18:06.830 --> 02:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
a major issue in New Hampshire the point
 
02:18:09.709 --> 02:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
in time count has gone up by over 50%
 
02:18:11.389 --> 02:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
from 2022 to
 
02:18:13.990 --> 02:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
2023 and you know municipalities
 
02:18:15.750 --> 02:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
certainly need in the state need more
 
02:18:18.750 --> 02:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
tools to try and make this happen the
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
concerns that our members have Express
 
02:18:23.309 --> 02:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
to us around this is um what the
 
02:18:25.349 --> 02:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative brought up around code
 
02:18:28.429 --> 02:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
and lowering safety standards that would
 
02:18:31.309 --> 02:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
potentially put Folks at risk and that
 
02:18:33.990 --> 02:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
this could create a situation where
 
02:18:35.549 --> 02:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
there's essentially a race to the bottom
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
where you're using shelters and
 
02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
structures that are not suitable for
 
02:18:42.509 --> 02:18:42.519 align:start position:0%
folks to be living in and not safe and
 
02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
that in our opinion can't be the answer
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
to addressing our homeless crisis is we
 
02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
can't just say oh we've got an abandoned
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
building over here that doesn't have
 
02:18:55.070 --> 02:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
bathrooms that isn't heated that may not
 
02:18:57.549 --> 02:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
be up to code and let's go put folks
 
02:19:00.509 --> 02:19:00.519 align:start position:0%
over there so we um you know they're out
 
02:19:02.950 --> 02:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
of sight in some cases and again not
 
02:19:04.629 --> 02:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
saying that's the intent necessarily
 
02:19:06.270 --> 02:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
here but that is a concern that came up
 
02:19:08.349 --> 02:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
about how this could be implemented
 
02:19:10.190 --> 02:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
there have been a lot of really great
 
02:19:12.589 --> 02:19:12.599 align:start position:0%
conversations and I believe even last
 
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
year around legislation around
 
02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
innovative solutions pods temporary
 
02:19:18.589 --> 02:19:18.599 align:start position:0%
structures these things that may be
 
02:19:21.150 --> 02:19:21.160 align:start position:0%
outside of existing building code that
 
02:19:23.709 --> 02:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
are sort of on the The Cutting Edge of
 
02:19:25.309 --> 02:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
how do you provide a temporary shelter
 
02:19:27.309 --> 02:19:27.319 align:start position:0%
in the midst of a crisis I think that
 
02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
has a incredible amount of Merit to be
 
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
able to look at take a peak make sure
 
02:19:34.230 --> 02:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
that our laws aren't preventing that or
 
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
mitigating risk there um but we do have
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of data on best practices for
 
02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
addressing homelessness that includes
 
02:19:44.349 --> 02:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
systems of care that includes person
 
02:19:46.870 --> 02:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
Byers identification that includes
 
02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
structures that provide health care that
 
02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
includes being able to when folks are
 
02:19:52.349 --> 02:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
getting sheltered have access to
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
additional resources in our opinion
 
02:19:57.150 --> 02:19:57.160 align:start position:0%
that's the direction we should be going
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
on this rather than just opening up um
 
02:20:02.830 --> 02:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
potentially unsafe environments but
 
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
again we don't have a formal position
 
02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
and we'd be happy to work with the
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
sponsor and the committee on you know
 
02:20:10.270 --> 02:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
any solutions if there is a agree upon
 
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
area moving forward and happy to take
 
02:20:15.990 --> 02:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
questions questions for Mr
 
02:20:19.469 --> 02:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
Taylor seeing none thank

into from study
 
02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
um I've been working for the last three

02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:51.280 align:start position:0%

work in the homelessness issue and on
 
02:21:02.190 --> 02:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
the policy committee which I served on
 
02:21:03.710 --> 02:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
with the welfare directors from the
 
02:21:07.030 --> 02:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
three cities in straford County uh we uh
 
02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
we looking at what are the obstacles to
 
02:21:11.790 --> 02:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
providing housing this is a very
 
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
complicated issue and we were looking
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
for something that we could do to be
 
02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
meaningful to help communities address
 
02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
housing this is not a replacement for
 
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
shelters real shelters that provides
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
services and safety and convenience for
 
02:21:31.070 --> 02:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
those who are homeless we did a survey
 
02:21:33.389 --> 02:21:33.399 align:start position:0%
in the straford County area and we found
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
that there were approximately 1400
 
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
people who are functionally unhoused
 
02:21:38.429 --> 02:21:38.439 align:start position:0%
these are people who may be couch
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
surfing living in their cars living in
 
02:21:43.750 --> 02:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
tents or boxes in the woods um or being
 
02:21:45.389 --> 02:21:45.399 align:start position:0%
put up in hotels by the local
 
02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
communities it's all most of it's very
 
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
expensive when we deal with homelessness
 
02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
also as a farmer state representative I
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
used to receive numerous phone calls
 
02:21:56.309 --> 02:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
from people who had homeless encampments
 
02:21:58.110 --> 02:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
in their backyards or just beyond their
 
02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
property in fact the biggest culprit
 
02:22:03.670 --> 02:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
that I had here was uh Spalding tur Pike
 
02:22:05.070 --> 02:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
runs through Rochester and it runs
 
02:22:07.469 --> 02:22:07.479 align:start position:0%
through my district and I would get
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
calls from people saying that they're
 
02:22:10.270 --> 02:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
behind my house and I've got an
 
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
encampment there and they're leaving
 
02:22:13.830 --> 02:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
trash all over the place what can I do I
 
02:22:15.230 --> 02:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
call the City of Rochester and they say
 
02:22:16.830 --> 02:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
it's on State
 
02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
Property well the thing is is yeah it's
 
02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
on state property but there's no nobody
 
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
there to move them off that property and
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
when we do move them off that property
 
02:22:25.870 --> 02:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
all we do is we chase them to another
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
piece of property in somebody else's
 
02:22:30.309 --> 02:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
backyard if a municipality has a piece
 
02:22:32.950 --> 02:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
of land that may be available where they
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
can set up their
 
02:22:38.510 --> 02:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
tents why aren't we able to use that I
 
02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
served on the city council in Rochester
 
02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years served with
 
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative WKA here for many years
 
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
and we looked at solutions for many
 
02:22:48.590 --> 02:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
problems and if you're a city councilman
 
02:22:51.309 --> 02:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
or a board of selectman member when you
 
02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
have approach where your your town
 
02:22:54.910 --> 02:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
administrator or city manager may come
 
02:22:55.870 --> 02:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
in and
 
02:22:58.150 --> 02:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
say we've got a piece of land that we'd
 
02:23:00.110 --> 02:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
like to use that maybe we can move these
 
02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
homeless people to it may be a park that
 
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
hasn't been used much or an area or even
 
02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
a parking lot that isn't being used or
 
02:23:09.790 --> 02:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
behind an a building or maybe it's a
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
vacant building that you
 
02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
have I would look at my administrator
 
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
and and and my manager and I would say
 
02:23:18.750 --> 02:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
what are our liabilities and he said
 
02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
well he would say he or she would say if
 
02:23:21.870 --> 02:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
somebody gets hurt we're probably going
 
02:23:24.750 --> 02:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
to get sued and I would say nope not
 
02:23:26.670 --> 02:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
going there because I don't want to put
 
02:23:30.349 --> 02:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
my taxpayers in situation of having
 
02:23:32.309 --> 02:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that could cost hundreds of
 
02:23:34.030 --> 02:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to the taxpayers if
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
somebody was to be
 
02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
injured these people are currently
 
02:23:41.429 --> 02:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
living in the woods let's start with
 
02:23:41.439 --> 02:23:42.510 align:start position:0%
living in the woods let's start with
that

02:23:42.510 --> 02:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
proposition when we met as a policy
 
02:23:46.510 --> 02:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
committee the directors of plan the
 
02:23:48.510 --> 02:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
welfare directors of Rochester Dover
 
02:23:50.190 --> 02:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
summersworth the housing administrator
 
02:23:54.429 --> 02:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
and in Dover as well um we talked about
 
02:23:56.190 --> 02:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
that these people are living in the
 
02:23:58.590 --> 02:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
woods right now they're living in boxes
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
they're living in tents they're living
 
02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:01.790 align:start position:0%
they're living in tents they're living
under

02:24:01.790 --> 02:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
tarps communities have land that may be
 
02:24:06.910 --> 02:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
a better case place for them to
 
02:24:10.110 --> 02:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
be we may have a vacant garage which we
 
02:24:11.910 --> 02:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
can make
 
02:24:14.510 --> 02:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
safe what it says in the
 
02:24:17.389 --> 02:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
bill is that employee if employees
 
02:24:20.830 --> 02:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
intentionally act to create harm or risk
 
02:24:23.030 --> 02:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
of harm or acted with a conscious
 
02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
disregard for the safety of
 
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
others then we're responsible but if we
 
02:24:30.309 --> 02:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
don't meet that
 
02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
criteria then we should be held harmless
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
if a community decides to provide an
 
02:24:37.230 --> 02:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity straford county has the war
 
02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
Willard warming Center and what happened
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
there is that we they were licensed
 
02:24:43.550 --> 02:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
basically to have 80 people in the
 
02:24:45.870 --> 02:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
center and I know I met with the city
 
02:24:47.950 --> 02:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
manager of the city of Dover and he went
 
02:24:49.469 --> 02:24:49.479 align:start position:0%
in and he said you know we've got a lot
 
02:24:50.590 --> 02:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
of people I went in and looked like a
 
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
military Barracks quite honestly there
 
02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
were bunk beds people were living in
 
02:24:56.950 --> 02:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
them people were sleeping in them in the
 
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
evenings but they weren't there during
 
02:25:00.389 --> 02:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
the day time they had their stuff stored
 
02:25:01.870 --> 02:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
and he said you know this is unsafe you
 
02:25:04.030 --> 02:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
got stuff that's stored here overnight
 
02:25:05.110 --> 02:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
we're not supposed to have anything here
 
02:25:06.429 --> 02:25:06.439 align:start position:0%
stored overnight what do these people
 
02:25:07.469 --> 02:25:07.479 align:start position:0%
supposed to do with their stuff
 
02:25:09.550 --> 02:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
particularly if they're going to a
 
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
job and then when they got to a point
 
02:25:15.550 --> 02:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
where they had maybe 12 people show up
 
02:25:16.990 --> 02:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
on a very cold
 
02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
evening some of them were pitching their
 
02:25:21.910 --> 02:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
tent on the grounds
 
02:25:25.269 --> 02:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
that wasn't unsafe it was very safe it
 
02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
was safer than being where they where
 
02:25:29.790 --> 02:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
they were out in the woods or in
 
02:25:31.870 --> 02:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
somebody's backyard causing A disruption
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
to the people who own that property this
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
was a bill that was a simple approach to
 
02:25:39.790 --> 02:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
allow communities to address the
 
02:25:41.790 --> 02:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
situations for temporary places for
 
02:25:43.230 --> 02:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
shelter while they're dealing with it
 
02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
you get many communities particularly
 
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
small communities it's not in their
 
02:25:48.030 --> 02:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
budget to put up a homeless shelter a
 
02:25:49.230 --> 02:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
lot of times they send them to the
 
02:25:51.309 --> 02:25:51.319 align:start position:0%
cities and the Cities end up with them
 
02:25:53.510 --> 02:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
living on the streets or living in in
 
02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:54.630 align:start position:0%
living on the streets or living in in
people's

02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
people's
 
02:25:57.309 --> 02:25:57.319 align:start position:0%
backyards and in drafting this bill I
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
felt this was a way to approach the
 
02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
situation to provide opport so that
 
02:26:04.230 --> 02:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a
 
02:26:07.429 --> 02:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
roadblock to a community saying we can
 
02:26:10.750 --> 02:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
do something here it's not perfect but
 
02:26:11.790 --> 02:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
02:26:14.269 --> 02:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
start I'll be happy to answer any
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
questions thank you other
 
02:26:21.750 --> 02:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
02:26:23.389 --> 02:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
so at this time I would ask is there
 
02:26:25.150 --> 02:26:25.160 align:start position:0%
anyone present who wishes to speak on
 
02:26:26.830 --> 02:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
this bill who has not yet had the
 
02:26:29.150 --> 02:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so seeing none the
 
02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Gilman

appreciate your patience
 
02:29:59.150 --> 02:29:59.160 align:start position:0%

668 FN local authorizing municipalities
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
to hold a referendum to resend the
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
licenses of historic horse racing
 
02:30:16.030 --> 02:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
facilities at this time the chair
 
02:30:18.349 --> 02:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative M the prime
 
02:30:20.230 --> 02:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor to introduce the bill to the
 
02:30:22.269 --> 02:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
committee good morning and welcome to
 
02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government good
 
02:30:27.070 --> 02:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
morning Madam chair and good morning to
 
02:30:29.429 --> 02:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
the representatives of the committee uh
 
02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
you've heard my first bill which is to
 
02:30:35.070 --> 02:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
uh allow an optin and this is this this
 
02:30:37.269 --> 02:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
is the other uh part of the process to
 
02:30:39.349 --> 02:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
allow and opt out this bill is
 
02:30:42.190 --> 02:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
essentially a tool in your toolbox to
 
02:30:45.550 --> 02:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
deal with possible problems in your
 
02:30:48.590 --> 02:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
community what the bill does is gives
 
02:30:50.550 --> 02:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
local control
 
02:30:52.349 --> 02:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
over Casino
 
02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
locations if you like your casino at
 
02:30:57.630 --> 02:30:57.640 align:start position:0%
your location you can keep it if you
 
02:31:00.750 --> 02:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
don't like it you can ask them to move
 
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
or you can shut them
 
02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
down so why do we need this
 
02:31:10.870 --> 02:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
bill well as I mentioned previously
 
02:31:13.230 --> 02:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
cities and towns were never allowed to
 
02:31:16.230 --> 02:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
have an optin vote on casinos in your
 
02:31:17.950 --> 02:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
local city and
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
town the bill that allowed
 
02:31:23.150 --> 02:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
the historic horse racing machines was a
 
02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
very simple Bill and said that you if
 
02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
you have a charitable gaming license you
 
02:31:29.950 --> 02:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
can apply for a HHR license which turns
 
02:31:31.830 --> 02:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
out to be slot
 
02:31:35.630 --> 02:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
machines okay now in the past and
 
02:31:37.429 --> 02:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
various Casino bills that Ways and Means
 
02:31:40.030 --> 02:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
had worked on if you wanted to do
 
02:31:42.910 --> 02:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
expanded gaming you're required to have
 
02:31:45.550 --> 02:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
a referendum by the city and town the
 
02:31:47.710 --> 02:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
state will allow it but you the city and
 
02:31:49.950 --> 02:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
town you the municipality
 
02:31:52.469 --> 02:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
have that decision to take it or leave
 
02:31:55.630 --> 02:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
it not available in this uh current
 
02:31:58.469 --> 02:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
legislation that allow the HHR
 
02:32:01.469 --> 02:32:01.479 align:start position:0%
machines so these tend to be very
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
profitable devices if you have slot
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
machines and other jurisdictions you
 
02:32:08.429 --> 02:32:08.439 align:start position:0%
typically have a very large license fee
 
02:32:11.790 --> 02:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
in NE of 25 million bucks to 80 million
 
02:32:14.550 --> 02:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
bucks just to have a license to have
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
these type of machines
 
02:32:20.190 --> 02:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we charge
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:27.230 --> 02:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
bucks um in other jurisdictions if you
 
02:32:28.590 --> 02:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
have these machines there's a pretty
 
02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
considerable tax on
 
02:32:33.870 --> 02:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
these in Massachusetts if you if you buy
 
02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
a license for 25 million bucks you're
 
02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
subject to a 49%
 
02:32:42.429 --> 02:32:42.439 align:start position:0%
tax here in New
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have to give
 
02:32:49.269 --> 02:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
25% to the state and to Charities and
 
02:32:51.070 --> 02:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
the oper keep keeps
 
02:32:54.349 --> 02:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
75% pretty generous so now you have an
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
Enterprise that has um non-existent
 
02:32:59.910 --> 02:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
license fee a very high margin and the
 
02:33:01.950 --> 02:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
ability to put slot machines wherever
 
02:33:02.830 --> 02:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
they want
 
02:33:05.790 --> 02:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
them so what's
 
02:33:07.710 --> 02:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
happening well what's happening is the
 
02:33:09.429 --> 02:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
mom and pop operators in charitable
 
02:33:12.349 --> 02:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
gaming lucky moose in Nashville where I
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
live sell out to the big investors
 
02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
because they're saying well geez I can
 
02:33:22.190 --> 02:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
put in a slot C know with very little
 
02:33:26.030 --> 02:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
expense to do it and very good terms if
 
02:33:29.630 --> 02:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
I put it in I pay roughly five and 3/4%
 
02:33:32.030 --> 02:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
to Charities under state law the rest is
 
02:33:33.269 --> 02:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
split to the
 
02:33:37.950 --> 02:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
lottery um a pretty good deal so the mom
 
02:33:39.429 --> 02:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
and pop operators was sing out to the
 
02:33:42.670 --> 02:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
big investors ecl
 
02:33:46.550 --> 02:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
entertainment um Delaware North large
 
02:33:49.990 --> 02:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
out ofate corporations no problem
 
02:33:51.790 --> 02:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
because they have a lot of capital and
 
02:33:53.469 --> 02:33:53.479 align:start position:0%
they use that Capital
 
02:33:58.750 --> 02:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
to put these licenses into a much bigger
 
02:34:01.550 --> 02:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
building in my case I live in
 
02:34:04.750 --> 02:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
nashille the Feather Lane mall is a main
 
02:34:08.110 --> 02:34:08.120 align:start position:0%
shopping center Sears is one of the five
 
02:34:09.630 --> 02:34:09.640 align:start position:0%
big stores there they they're on of
 
02:34:11.349 --> 02:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
business that's
 
02:34:14.990 --> 02:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
vacant so Sears gets bought
 
02:34:18.590 --> 02:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
out and now we have a casino coming in
 
02:34:20.269 --> 02:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
that'll be opening next month
 
02:34:22.269 --> 02:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
it'd be over a thousand
 
02:34:25.469 --> 02:34:25.479 align:start position:0%
Machines of same square footage and
 
02:34:27.790 --> 02:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
it'll attract a big
 
02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:29.990 align:start position:0%
it'll attract a big
crowd

02:34:29.990 --> 02:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
crowd
 
02:34:34.190 --> 02:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
so what's the impact on the local
 
02:34:36.830 --> 02:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
folks I spent 10 weeks
 
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
campaigning and I asked people what
 
02:34:41.389 --> 02:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
their concerns are and I'm sure there're
 
02:34:43.110 --> 02:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
the concerns that you've heard from your
 
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
constituents which is property
 
02:34:48.670 --> 02:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
taxes we've had a snap revaluation in
 
02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:51.030 align:start position:0%
taxes we've had a snap revaluation in
ashaa

02:34:51.030 --> 02:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
ashaa
 
02:34:53.550 --> 02:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
our typical property which is in the
 
02:34:57.469 --> 02:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
order of 4 100,000 now has gone up
 
02:34:57.479 --> 02:34:59.510 align:start position:0%
order of 4 100,000 now has gone up
100,000

02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
100,000
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
valuation and that caused their tax
 
02:35:05.910 --> 02:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
bill to go up about a th000
 
02:35:09.469 --> 02:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
bucks so we're pretty unhappy about the
 
02:35:12.269 --> 02:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
property taxes in nville and I'm sure
 
02:35:13.550 --> 02:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
your cities and towns are feeling the
 
02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:14.469 align:start position:0%
your cities and towns are feeling the
same

02:35:14.469 --> 02:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:35:17.070 --> 02:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
way so then they asked me well what are
 
02:35:19.750 --> 02:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
we going to do about it
 
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
well I said well we got this big Casino
 
02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
coming up in The Fez Lane
 
02:35:27.510 --> 02:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:30.389 --> 02:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
us no they're not
 
02:35:32.670 --> 02:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
required the best we can do is say well
 
02:35:34.150 --> 02:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
we want to be one of the Charities maybe
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
we can get a piece of the action maybe
 
02:35:40.349 --> 02:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
you know one half of 10 days a year for
 
02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:46.750 --> 02:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
$100,000 I would point out that in other
 
02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
Casino bills that we
 
02:35:51.070 --> 02:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
had there was a lot of thought given to
 
02:35:54.750 --> 02:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
mitigation by the host Community our
 
02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
communities that mitigation was in the
 
02:36:00.510 --> 02:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
form of 5% off the
 
02:36:03.349 --> 02:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
top we don't have that it's not in the
 
02:36:04.750 --> 02:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
horse racing
 
02:36:08.110 --> 02:36:08.120 align:start position:0%
Bill the casino operators have no
 
02:36:10.150 --> 02:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
obligation to give anything to the
 
02:36:11.269 --> 02:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
cities and
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
towns besides they very modest property
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
tax and a m in at the pH Lan mall for
 
02:36:20.309 --> 02:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
example it's
 
02:36:23.870 --> 02:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
$118,000 on the current valuation you
 
02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
know for business that's going to put
 
02:36:32.190 --> 02:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
out $24 million to charity 20 million to
 
02:36:34.910 --> 02:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
charity 200,000 to the city of nasua
 
02:36:36.870 --> 02:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
seems a little
 
02:36:40.510 --> 02:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
unbalanced so what I'm suggesting is
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
that we set ourselves up to a bit of
 
02:36:48.950 --> 02:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
negotiation um shouldn't we have a tool
 
02:36:51.630 --> 02:36:51.640 align:start position:0%
in our tool box that says if you're not
 
02:36:53.630 --> 02:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
treating us right and this would be
 
02:36:55.630 --> 02:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
voluntary there's no statutory
 
02:36:57.389 --> 02:36:57.399 align:start position:0%
obligation to do anything for the city
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
and towns but if you're not treating us
 
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
right so we have in our toolbox that
 
02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
says you know we enjoyed being here for
 
02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
three years but now your license is
 
02:37:06.990 --> 02:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
coming up for
 
02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
Renewal and you know our citizens are
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
kind of concerned about property taxes
 
02:37:14.389 --> 02:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
the cost we have to pay for schools
 
02:37:16.750 --> 02:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
which is most our property tax and
 
02:37:20.070 --> 02:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
you're not doing anything for us
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
so maybe we should
 
02:37:25.309 --> 02:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
negotiate now if you don't have any
 
02:37:29.870 --> 02:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
tools to negotiate well good luck if you
 
02:37:32.190 --> 02:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
have a tool that says you don't want to
 
02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
talk to
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
us we're going to put out a
 
02:37:39.469 --> 02:37:39.479 align:start position:0%
referendum and see what the folks think
 
02:37:40.910 --> 02:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
and see if the people who are unhappy
 
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
about their property taxes and see this
 
02:37:45.510 --> 02:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
casino with the traffic any other issues
 
02:37:50.710 --> 02:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
which is documented in this long handout
 
02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:52.309 align:start position:0%
which is documented in this long handout
that

02:37:52.309 --> 02:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:37:54.630 --> 02:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't want you anymore and
 
02:37:56.550 --> 02:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
we'll say thanks for your three years
 
02:37:59.429 --> 02:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
but uh time to move
 
02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
on so let me talk a little bit about the
 
02:38:05.389 --> 02:38:05.399 align:start position:0%
cost of crime in
 
02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
casinos this document is a 20-year
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
study of every count every county in the
 
02:38:14.349 --> 02:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
United States excuse me representative
 
02:38:18.030 --> 02:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
on could could you focus your testimony
 
02:38:23.309 --> 02:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
on the is issue of the um opt out
 
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
provision I and focus on that and
 
02:38:27.910 --> 02:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
because we do have a lot of pink cards
 
02:38:31.349 --> 02:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
so if you could Target your testimony
 
02:38:35.870 --> 02:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
and seek to um finish up having laid the
 
02:38:37.389 --> 02:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
foundation for the out
 
02:38:41.830 --> 02:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
provision the provision is is that uh
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
the city and town has the
 
02:38:48.269 --> 02:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
right to call a
 
02:38:51.190 --> 02:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
referendum and as to whether
 
02:38:55.230 --> 02:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
this Enterprise this horse racing Casino
 
02:38:58.990 --> 02:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
shall be allowed to stay or
 
02:39:04.309 --> 02:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
not the bill says that if we choose to
 
02:39:07.150 --> 02:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
either the citizens with a 5% vote of
 
02:39:09.190 --> 02:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
the people in
 
02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
town or the town
 
02:39:15.230 --> 02:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
administrators can call a referendum and
 
02:39:17.349 --> 02:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
ask do we want to have
 
02:39:19.990 --> 02:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
this casino license
 
02:39:21.190 --> 02:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
remain in
 
02:39:24.910 --> 02:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
place or do we want to have it
 
02:39:28.910 --> 02:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:31.389 --> 02:39:31.399 align:start position:0%
tool I hope you consider some of the
 
02:39:34.309 --> 02:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
reasons for having that tool and the
 
02:39:35.309 --> 02:39:35.319 align:start position:0%
choice is
 
02:39:38.110 --> 02:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
yours thank you madam chairman thank you
 
02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:41.389 align:start position:0%
yours thank you madam chairman thank you
other

02:39:41.389 --> 02:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative Colby thank you
 
02:39:47.429 --> 02:39:47.439 align:start position:0%
madam chair just a really quick question
 
02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh if a municipality were to vote favor
 
02:39:51.630 --> 02:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
of prohibition while there is an
 
02:39:54.830 --> 02:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
existing operation in place how much
 
02:39:59.110 --> 02:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
notice uh would the municipality be
 
02:40:02.429 --> 02:40:02.439 align:start position:0%
required to give to the owner
 
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
operator yeah that's specified in the
 
02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
statute uh for
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
referendums um and that's an excellent
 
02:40:11.950 --> 02:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
question because you can't shut down an
 
02:40:13.950 --> 02:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
existing business you can only shut down
 
02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:15.990 align:start position:0%
existing business you can only shut down
the

02:40:15.990 --> 02:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:17.630 align:start position:0%
the
license

02:40:17.630 --> 02:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:40:21.550 --> 02:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
um the timeing on this is at the annual
 
02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:22.990 align:start position:0%
um the timeing on this is at the annual
Town

02:40:22.990 --> 02:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
Town
 
02:40:25.389 --> 02:40:25.399 align:start position:0%
meetings so when you have your votes for
 
02:40:28.429 --> 02:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
your budget this would be part of that
 
02:40:30.750 --> 02:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
process and it would not be retroactive
 
02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
it would be prospective when the license
 
02:40:36.750 --> 02:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
comes up for Renewal and this referenda
 
02:40:39.230 --> 02:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
passes that license shall not be renewed
 
02:40:42.510 --> 02:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:45.389 --> 02:40:45.399 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction further
 
02:40:48.590 --> 02:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
questions I had a quick question so um
 
02:40:50.030 --> 02:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
with regards
 
02:40:54.309 --> 02:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
to I guess gambling or um this casino
 
02:40:56.670 --> 02:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
licensing is there a separate license
 
02:40:59.750 --> 02:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
for like the casino for example like the
 
02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
what is it called the the what moose the
 
02:41:05.670 --> 02:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
lucky moose in nashaa right so there's a
 
02:41:07.950 --> 02:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
separate license for that operation and
 
02:41:09.630 --> 02:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
then is it correct that there's a
 
02:41:12.110 --> 02:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
separate license for
 
02:41:15.309 --> 02:41:15.319 align:start position:0%
HHR uh the license for the lucky moose
 
02:41:15.319 --> 02:41:16.389 align:start position:0%
HHR uh the license for the lucky moose
is

02:41:16.389 --> 02:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:41:19.269 --> 02:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
$250 and they can apply to have historic
 
02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
op racing which they have and were
 
02:41:25.309 --> 02:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
granted so you have a chable gaming
 
02:41:28.030 --> 02:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
operation card games
 
02:41:31.990 --> 02:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
standard you know Blackjack and uh hold
 
02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:32.870 align:start position:0%
standard you know Blackjack and uh hold
them

02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:41:34.910 --> 02:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
tournaments you were allowed to apply
 
02:41:37.389 --> 02:41:37.399 align:start position:0%
for a license for expanding that
 
02:41:37.399 --> 02:41:38.830 align:start position:0%
for a license for expanding that
historic

02:41:38.830 --> 02:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
historic
 
02:41:42.070 --> 02:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
racing and 14 of the chable gaming
 
02:41:46.349 --> 02:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
establishments were qualified for
 
02:41:50.030 --> 02:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
that so a followup is is this this bill
 
02:41:53.469 --> 02:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
pertains just to that secondary license
 
02:41:56.590 --> 02:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
to allow HHR it wouldn't be shutting
 
02:41:59.469 --> 02:41:59.479 align:start position:0%
down the entire operation it's just that
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's just that particular game yes CH
 
02:42:07.870 --> 02:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
yes the uh the facilities that have HHR
 
02:42:10.750 --> 02:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
machines would be shut
 
02:42:13.389 --> 02:42:13.399 align:start position:0%
down if they don't have HHR they're not
 
02:42:16.469 --> 02:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:19.750 --> 02:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
effective representing a frock
 
02:42:21.269 --> 02:42:21.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:42:25.150 --> 02:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I I assume that
 
02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
these slot machines cost a considerable
 
02:42:32.510 --> 02:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
amount of money to the owner of the
 
02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
casino um if they lose their license
 
02:42:41.710 --> 02:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
would they have a claim of in essence
 
02:42:44.870 --> 02:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
taking unlawfully taking of their
 
02:42:47.150 --> 02:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
property I would be skeptical on that
 
02:42:48.630 --> 02:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
first these machines are tend to be
 
02:42:50.750 --> 02:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
least rather than
 
02:42:53.550 --> 02:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
purchased if they are purchased they
 
02:42:55.389 --> 02:42:55.399 align:start position:0%
have a license for 3 years to operate
 
02:42:55.399 --> 02:42:56.269 align:start position:0%
have a license for 3 years to operate
these

02:42:56.269 --> 02:42:56.279 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:42:58.750 --> 02:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
machines they're not guaranteed Beyond
 
02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:00.190 align:start position:0%
machines they're not guaranteed Beyond
three

02:43:00.190 --> 02:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:43:02.469 --> 02:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
years for these machines they made a
 
02:43:05.469 --> 02:43:05.479 align:start position:0%
business decision as to what to invest
 
02:43:07.309 --> 02:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
how long they can have them and what
 
02:43:08.870 --> 02:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
kind of profit they can make to pay for
 
02:43:11.309 --> 02:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
that Enterprise beyond that would be
 
02:43:14.870 --> 02:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
speculation uh thank you that answers my
 
02:43:17.389 --> 02:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
question further
 
02:43:20.790 --> 02:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank thank
 
02:43:27.750 --> 02:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:30.349 --> 02:43:30.359 align:start position:0%

gaming operators Association we are here
 
02:43:43.230 --> 02:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
in opposition of this bill as it was
 
02:43:44.950 --> 02:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
just indicated it would resend the
 
02:43:46.590 --> 02:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
rights of existing businesses to
 
02:43:48.030 --> 02:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
continue practicing
 
02:43:49.910 --> 02:43:49.920 align:start position:0%

five more in the application process it
 
02:43:58.710 --> 02:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
caps out at that there are no other

applications allowed to be accepted by
 
02:44:02.830 --> 02:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire until 2031 so
 
02:44:05.070 --> 02:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
there is already a limit on this these
 
02:44:07.190 --> 02:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
11 operating and the three that are
 
02:44:09.590 --> 02:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
building out have spent millions of
 
02:44:12.389 --> 02:44:12.399 align:start position:0%
dollars in order to have the space the
 
02:44:14.550 --> 02:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
time and the facilities to operate
 
02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing some do buy them
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
some do lease them and they have
 
02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts but if you were to
 
02:44:23.269 --> 02:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
look at where these physical businesses
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
were and what they looked like before
 
02:44:26.750 --> 02:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
the authorization of historic horse
 
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
racing 2021 you would see the incredible
 
02:44:31.070 --> 02:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
amounts of money these operators have
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
put in to make it a full gaming
 
02:44:35.510 --> 02:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
experience if a town were to resin their
 
02:44:37.710 --> 02:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
right to practice they would absolutely
 
02:44:38.990 --> 02:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
lose an enormous amount of money that
 
02:44:40.910 --> 02:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
had they have given to New Hampshire and
 
02:44:42.710 --> 02:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
to of course the hundreds of Charities
 
02:44:45.110 --> 02:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
that benefit from HHR just in December
 
02:44:46.150 --> 02:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
so that you know that's the recent
 
02:44:49.190 --> 02:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
numbers I have uh the state received 2.5
 
02:44:51.269 --> 02:44:51.279 align:start position:0%
million in revenue from historic horse
 
02:44:53.950 --> 02:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
raising and Charities received 1.4
 
02:44:56.469 --> 02:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
million and for those reasons we are
 
02:44:57.590 --> 02:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill and I'm happy to
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%

rely on us as their family based on our
 
02:52:13.870 --> 02:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
contract with the state we receive a

daily rate for the children in our care
 
02:52:20.070 --> 02:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
which covers only half of our expenses
 
02:52:22.070 --> 02:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
that said is it is critical that we
 
02:52:24.150 --> 02:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
close the funding Gap with revenue
 
02:52:26.269 --> 02:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
streams including grants individual and
 
02:52:28.110 --> 02:52:28.120 align:start position:0%
corporate donations and thankfully
 
02:52:30.389 --> 02:52:30.399 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
02:52:32.630 --> 02:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
funds the charitable gaming funds are
 
02:52:34.309 --> 02:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
critical to the Webster house they help
 
02:52:36.229 --> 02:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
us provide the highest level of care for
 
02:52:38.070 --> 02:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
our residents who deserve a second
 
02:52:40.269 --> 02:52:40.279 align:start position:0%
chance give them a home filled with
 
02:52:42.229 --> 02:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
healthy food appropriate clothing and
 
02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
all of the basic needs that build their
 
02:52:46.990 --> 02:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
trust happiness confidence and enable
 
02:52:49.630 --> 02:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
them to thrive These funds are well
 
02:52:51.750 --> 02:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
established in our budget and very very
 
02:52:54.229 --> 02:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
grateful for these funds and we rely on
 
02:52:57.190 --> 02:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
them to close this funding Gap any
 
02:52:59.389 --> 02:52:59.399 align:start position:0%
Revenue loss from charitable gaming will
 
02:53:02.229 --> 02:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
would hurt us and the many I believe
 
02:53:04.670 --> 02:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
it's 800 organizations that serve those
 
02:53:08.309 --> 02:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
in need eliminating any of this funding
 
02:53:11.309 --> 02:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
would significantly impact our operation
 
02:53:12.469 --> 02:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
and would mean we would have to
 
02:53:14.950 --> 02:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate some of the initiatives that
 
02:53:18.030 --> 02:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
positively impact our children
 
02:53:20.229 --> 02:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming has provided much
 
02:53:22.910 --> 02:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
needed Revenue to organizations like the
 
02:53:25.349 --> 02:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
Webster house making them an essential
 
02:53:28.070 --> 02:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
component of our state's so social
 
02:53:32.550 --> 02:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
safety net we rely on these funds HB
 
02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
668 would put Charities like ours at
 
02:53:39.190 --> 02:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
risk I strongly urge you to reject HB
 
02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
668 and protect our charitable Gaming
 
02:53:43.790 --> 02:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
Community losing those funds would be
 
02:53:46.150 --> 02:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
harmful to our organization and hurt

lot to the patients that we serve this
 
02:55:54.590 --> 02:55:54.600 align:start position:0%

relied on charitable gaming to fund

essential programs House Bill 668
 
02:57:39.830 --> 02:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
threatens that
 
02:57:42.510 --> 02:57:42.520 align:start position:0%

essential funding for nonprofits
 
02:57:49.070 --> 02:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide for us that means fewer

athletic trainers reduced Injury Care

02:58:52.389 --> 02:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
money that should be used for your home
 
02:58:52.399 --> 02:58:53.429 align:start position:0%
money that should be used for your home
budget

02:58:53.429 --> 02:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:58:57.550 --> 02:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
Etc uh on gambling we've had experience
 
02:59:01.469 --> 02:59:01.479 align:start position:0%
of people that uh were in important
 
02:59:05.150 --> 02:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
positions that ended up
 
02:59:09.990 --> 02:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
on uh I think one of them in jail uh
 
02:59:14.630 --> 02:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
because they stole from the organization
 
02:59:17.750 --> 02:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
that they were working for um because
 
02:59:20.309 --> 02:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
they were addicted to
 
02:59:20.319 --> 02:59:21.870 align:start position:0%
they were addicted to
gambling

02:59:21.870 --> 02:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
gambling
 
02:59:27.429 --> 02:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
and I rather regard our current position
 
02:59:31.550 --> 02:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
as that we are funding part of our
 
02:59:34.190 --> 02:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
government on
 
02:59:36.870 --> 02:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
addiction of those
 
02:59:40.550 --> 02:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
people that are not capable of stopping
 
02:59:44.070 --> 02:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
gambling once they've been been addicted
 
02:59:47.269 --> 02:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
to it we have almost no money and we
 
02:59:54.550 --> 02:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
have no uh even board left that in the
 
02:59:57.389 --> 02:59:57.399 align:start position:0%
uh the Lottery Commission there is
 
02:59:59.790 --> 02:59:59.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a board connected to it
 
03:00:01.670 --> 03:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
which is doing problem
 
03:00:05.070 --> 03:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
gambling and uh I think it was three of
 
03:00:07.870 --> 03:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
the four people who were on it have
 
03:00:11.349 --> 03:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
resigned at this point and there is
 
03:00:14.030 --> 03:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
really nothing else in the state except
 
03:00:16.630 --> 03:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
individuals going out and trying to talk
 
03:00:20.550 --> 03:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:23.429 --> 03:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
um we we stand pretty much with
 
03:00:26.870 --> 03:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
Littleton on this both of us were given
 
03:00:31.550 --> 03:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
casinos without uh knowing what we were
 
03:00:35.429 --> 03:00:35.439 align:start position:0%
getting into in our case it was a a
 
03:00:39.110 --> 03:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming group that was started
 
03:00:43.510 --> 03:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
for poker uh by someone who knew that
 
03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
the bill was likely going to pass at one
 
03:00:48.630 --> 03:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
point or another
 
03:00:54.150 --> 03:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
and um it's now a major Casino uh across
 
03:00:57.830 --> 03:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
from our cheapest best
 
03:01:02.269 --> 03:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
supermarket and AC and down one building
 
03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
from the our major thrift store which
 
03:01:08.870 --> 03:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
funds a lot of our poverty
 
03:01:13.110 --> 03:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
initiatives the people in that
 
03:01:17.710 --> 03:01:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh on store thrift store or and the
 
03:01:19.429 --> 03:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
people people who run
 
03:01:23.469 --> 03:01:23.479 align:start position:0%
listen uh have said that they didn't
 
03:01:25.670 --> 03:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
want to ask for any of that money
 
03:01:28.429 --> 03:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
because they are seeing too much damage
 
03:01:29.910 --> 03:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
since it
 
03:01:33.790 --> 03:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
moved uh before it moved when it was a
 
03:01:36.790 --> 03:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
small Poker Palace that they put a lot
 
03:01:42.030 --> 03:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
of machines in um on too much damage to
 
03:01:45.790 --> 03:01:45.800 align:start position:0%
their clients who are incapable of
 
03:01:49.590 --> 03:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
stopping and also Inc capable of funding
 
03:01:54.389 --> 03:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
their families or their housing or their
 
03:01:57.710 --> 03:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
food so
 
03:02:00.750 --> 03:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
um I feel pretty strongly about this
 
03:02:03.950 --> 03:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
individually I I know for sure that the
 
03:02:05.710 --> 03:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
city of Lebanon would have voted this
 
03:02:07.950 --> 03:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
down 15 years ago I don't know if it
 
03:02:12.309 --> 03:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
would now uh but I do think that that
 
03:02:15.269 --> 03:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
other towns ought to have the chance to
 
03:02:17.269 --> 03:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
decide whether they want that in their
 
03:02:19.070 --> 03:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
town or not
 
03:02:23.710 --> 03:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
not thank you thank you are there any
 
03:02:26.990 --> 03:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so this
 
03:02:28.870 --> 03:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
was the last pink card that I have and
 
03:02:30.750 --> 03:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask at this time is there
 
03:02:32.630 --> 03:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
anyone present who wishes to speak on
 
03:02:34.269 --> 03:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
this bill who has not yet had the
 
03:02:36.229 --> 03:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do
 
03:02:39.389 --> 03:02:39.399 align:start position:0%

04:08:42.269 --> 04:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
working with the sponsor uh and myself
 
04:08:44.149 --> 04:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
to try to work through the details of
 
04:08:47.630 --> 04:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
this bill which to uh which to some this
 
04:08:50.309 --> 04:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
bill we've seen many many times before
 
04:08:52.630 --> 04:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
um and we just try to get to a point
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
where we have something that that
 
04:08:58.710 --> 04:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
satisfies everybody and we can finally
 
04:09:01.030 --> 04:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh put behind us uh lock it up into
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
statute and our conversation was that we
 
04:09:09.670 --> 04:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
should with RSA 147 uh colon one create
 
04:09:11.870 --> 04:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
the guard rails to what health officers
 
04:09:14.229 --> 04:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
can do per the order ordinance and we
 
04:09:17.429 --> 04:09:17.439 align:start position:0%
think it leaving it too um as in their
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
for the removal of nuisances as in their
 
04:09:21.109 --> 04:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
judgment the health and safety of the
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
people require puts a guardrail because
 
04:09:25.870 --> 04:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
the statute again is specific to
 
04:09:28.309 --> 04:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
nuisances I had a wonderful conversation
 
04:09:29.469 --> 04:09:29.479 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor of the bill
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey bolia to talk
 
04:09:33.550 --> 04:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
about the potential to work together
 
04:09:36.590 --> 04:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
then in an additional year about giving
 
04:09:38.910 --> 04:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
the health officers than the same kind
 
04:09:42.149 --> 04:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
of latitude that that currently exists
 
04:09:44.030 --> 04:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
but they were curtailing bit but to give

them that Latitude in their communities

not fit neatly into a bucket that does

not fit neatly into a statute and how

willingness of the sponsor to uh to work

discussion representative
 
04:25:28.429 --> 04:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
majori thank you madam chairwoman
 
04:25:31.870 --> 04:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
um so we uh it seemed like it was a
 
04:25:33.510 --> 04:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable idea when we first heard the
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill and then as more information came
 
04:25:38.990 --> 04:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh as we learn more information there is
 
04:25:40.750 --> 04:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
a bill that's almost identical that's
 
04:25:43.109 --> 04:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
going through the Senate right now
 
04:25:46.189 --> 04:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
um and as we learned more information
 
04:25:49.229 --> 04:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
the current language in statute came as
 
04:25:52.269 --> 04:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
a recommendation from a study bill to
 
04:25:54.750 --> 04:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
clarify ambiguous language and the
 
04:25:57.269 --> 04:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill would be to take us
 
04:25:59.469 --> 04:25:59.479 align:start position:0%
not the intent but the result of this
 
04:26:01.349 --> 04:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
bill would be to take us back to what
 
04:26:05.349 --> 04:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
was considered ambiguous language so uh
 
04:26:08.750 --> 04:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
for those simple for for those reasons
 
04:26:11.269 --> 04:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
um I object the ought to pass and would
 
04:26:14.109 --> 04:26:14.119 align:start position:0%
hope that rather than an itl we might be
 
04:26:17.469 --> 04:26:17.479 align:start position:0%
able to get to um a point of retaining
 
04:26:20.070 --> 04:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
so that we can figure out what is
 
04:26:22.950 --> 04:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
actually the best language to have in
 
04:26:24.790 --> 04:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
here because I don't object to what they
 
04:26:26.670 --> 04:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
want to do I just think that we need to
 
04:26:28.990 --> 04:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
have a better way to get there so thank
 
04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
you further comments discussion
 
04:26:34.469 --> 04:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
representative stavis thank you madam
 
04:26:36.790 --> 04:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
chair I would agree with my colleague
 
04:26:39.070 --> 04:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
that this his bill would be better
 
04:26:42.790 --> 04:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
retained than passed um
 
04:26:45.109 --> 04:26:45.119 align:start position:0%
as a resident of Lebanon New Hampshire
 
04:26:47.710 --> 04:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
and neighboring Hanover New Hampshire we
 
04:26:51.830 --> 04:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
are surrounded by educational charitable
 
04:26:51.840 --> 04:26:53.070 align:start position:0%
are surrounded by educational charitable
nonprofit

04:26:53.070 --> 04:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
nonprofit
 
04:26:56.389 --> 04:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
organizations that own vast tracts of
 
04:26:58.349 --> 04:26:58.359 align:start position:0%
land within our
 
04:27:01.510 --> 04:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and sometimes the
 
04:27:04.590 --> 04:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
activities conducted on those tracts of
 
04:27:08.870 --> 04:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
lands do not comport with their missions
 
04:27:12.590 --> 04:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
and it is extremely difficult to make
 
04:27:14.830 --> 04:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
those distinctions and I I do believe
 
04:27:17.189 --> 04:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
that this bill bill makes it even more
 
04:27:19.389 --> 04:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
difficult to make those
 
04:27:21.790 --> 04:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
distinctions further
 
04:27:24.590 --> 04:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
comments so I had one comment as I
 
04:27:26.990 --> 04:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
recall during the hearing the primes and
 
04:27:28.590 --> 04:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
I do acknowledge what represented
 
04:27:31.870 --> 04:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
majority said um with the language
 
04:27:33.870 --> 04:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
that's in statute but I I do believe
 
04:27:36.429 --> 04:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
that I recall that the prime sponsor had
 
04:27:40.630 --> 04:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
explained that in in recent times um the
 
04:27:43.510 --> 04:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation is not being interpreted
 
04:27:46.309 --> 04:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
properly and therefore she felt the need
 
04:27:49.790 --> 04:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
to um clarify the language so that the
 
04:27:54.070 --> 04:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
statute was being applied um as the
 
04:27:56.349 --> 04:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
legislative in
 
04:28:00.630 --> 04:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
intent um was in the bill so I just
 
04:28:04.510 --> 04:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:07.790 --> 04:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
comment further
 
04:28:10.389 --> 04:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none the motion before
 
04:28:14.990 --> 04:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
us is ought to pass on House Bill 147 if

04:31:09.030 --> 04:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
second second representative majority
 
04:31:10.830 --> 04:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
seconds that would you like to speak to
 
04:31:14.070 --> 04:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
your motion to adopt the amendment
 
04:31:16.990 --> 04:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you um
 
04:31:18.750 --> 04:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment came as a result of
 
04:31:20.830 --> 04:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
conversations with the
 
04:31:24.590 --> 04:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh view of land and tax appeal uh made
 
04:31:26.429 --> 04:31:26.439 align:start position:0%
some additional modifications and made
 
04:31:28.389 --> 04:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill I believe a little bit
 
04:31:31.309 --> 04:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
better uh as far as they're concerned
 
04:31:33.670 --> 04:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
and the enforcement of the uh the bill
 
04:31:37.670 --> 04:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:44.269 --> 04:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:49.229 --> 04:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
discussion so um I have a
 
04:31:52.269 --> 04:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
comment so I looked I I do I'm not
 
04:31:54.510 --> 04:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
against the intent of the bill but as I
 
04:31:58.070 --> 04:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
continued to look at the bill and and
 
04:31:59.550 --> 04:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
especially the amendment I do
 
04:32:03.269 --> 04:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the amendment um fixes
 
04:32:07.590 --> 04:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
some incorrect dates that the bill um as
 
04:32:11.590 --> 04:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
filed had in it but I have I do have a
 
04:32:16.149 --> 04:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
con concern with I I I feel
 
04:32:19.630 --> 04:32:19.640 align:start position:0%
that the language here in the amendment
 
04:32:21.910 --> 04:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
which replaces um section one of the
 
04:32:25.710 --> 04:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
bill it doesn't quite do perhaps what
 
04:32:28.750 --> 04:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is hoping that the
 
04:32:32.269 --> 04:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
bill will will do and I would also say
 
04:32:34.990 --> 04:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
that the reason why we have um House
 
04:32:35.000 --> 04:32:35.910 align:start position:0%
that the reason why we have um House
Bill

04:32:35.910 --> 04:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:32:42.750 --> 04:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
426 was because 2024 House Bill 1055
 
04:32:44.229 --> 04:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
there again
 
04:32:48.309 --> 04:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
so there's the intent of the bill um and
 
04:32:52.870 --> 04:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
I think that what was missed is that any
 
04:32:56.910 --> 04:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
um bill that affects local property
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
taxes the effective date shall be April
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
1st of the following year and and there
 
04:33:05.470 --> 04:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
were some I
 
04:33:08.551 --> 04:33:08.561 align:start position:0%
guess questions as to oh why well why
 
04:33:11.230 --> 04:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
was that um effective date that well
 
04:33:13.750 --> 04:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's a statutory requirement so that
 
04:33:16.750 --> 04:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
answers that so but because of that
 
04:33:19.590 --> 04:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
because of what was trying to be done in
 
04:33:23.949 --> 04:33:23.959 align:start position:0%
1055 the original bill um and because of
 
04:33:26.109 --> 04:33:26.119 align:start position:0%
that effective date that's why we have
 
04:33:30.029 --> 04:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
this um second bill in the amendment and
 
04:33:33.070 --> 04:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
the concern is
 
04:33:37.429 --> 04:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
that on the last line nine it references
 
04:33:37.439 --> 04:33:38.629 align:start position:0%
that on the last line nine it references
RSA

04:33:38.629 --> 04:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:33:41.949 --> 04:33:41.959 align:start position:0%
7234 a and my understanding is that
 
04:33:44.349 --> 04:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
appeals must be done by September
 
04:33:44.359 --> 04:33:45.869 align:start position:0%
appeals must be done by September
1st

04:33:45.869 --> 04:33:45.879 align:start position:0%
1st
 
04:33:50.109 --> 04:33:50.119 align:start position:0%
and furthermore my concern is is that
 
04:33:53.109 --> 04:33:53.119 align:start position:0%
the way that this amendment is written
 
04:33:55.830 --> 04:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
that there's really no time limit that
 
04:33:58.869 --> 04:33:58.879 align:start position:0%
somebody can come back and you know
 
04:34:01.670 --> 04:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
request an adjustment so so that's a
 
04:34:04.070 --> 04:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
concern because it seems like it's just
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
going to throw
 
04:34:10.670 --> 04:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
um deadlines out out the window so I I
 
04:34:13.949 --> 04:34:13.959 align:start position:0%
won't um I won't go on but I I'm opposed
 
04:34:15.029 --> 04:34:15.039 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:34:15.039 --> 04:34:17.029 align:start position:0%
to the
amendment

04:34:17.029 --> 04:34:17.039 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:34:20.429 --> 04:34:20.439 align:start position:0%
and therefore yeah we'll we'll just take
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
the vote on
 
04:34:25.150 --> 04:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
this is there any other comments I'd
 
04:34:28.470 --> 04:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
like to respond yeah uh thank you madam
 
04:34:31.150 --> 04:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
chairman this is one thing we can really
 
04:34:33.470 --> 04:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
do the right thing just think if you're
 
04:34:37.429 --> 04:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit and in 8 months you have a
 
04:34:42.150 --> 04:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
choice of not paying 25 or 30 or 50,000
 
04:34:44.670 --> 04:34:44.680 align:start position:0%
in taxes because the law is going to
 
04:34:47.789 --> 04:34:47.799 align:start position:0%
change uh this this clearly identifies
 
04:34:49.349 --> 04:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
this is for the
 
04:34:54.230 --> 04:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
2024 tax year and right now if if people
 
04:34:56.189 --> 04:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
go in and say I'm I'm Ling my taxes I
 
04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
can't give any excuse the selectman just
 
04:35:00.150 --> 04:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
say that's too bad you owe 20 grand or
 
04:35:02.390 --> 04:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
15 grand or whatever it is this gives
 
04:35:04.590 --> 04:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity to go into the
 
04:35:06.750 --> 04:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
board of Selectmen and explain why
 
04:35:08.629 --> 04:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
they're late that's all it does it
 
04:35:09.629 --> 04:35:09.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't say you're going to get your
 
04:35:11.109 --> 04:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
taxes you don't have to pay your taxes
 
04:35:13.230 --> 04:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
or whatever it gives them the
 
04:35:14.910 --> 04:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go in and be
 
04:35:17.310 --> 04:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
heard and I think they least deserve
 
04:35:19.029 --> 04:35:19.039 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
04:35:22.910 --> 04:35:22.920 align:start position:0%

04:37:00.990 --> 04:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
15-3 do I have a motion a sec another
 
04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
motion representa
 
04:37:09.269 --> 04:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
McDonald yes I move uh otpa is there a
 
04:37:11.670 --> 04:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
second I'll second the motion
 
04:37:14.709 --> 04:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
representative majority seconds that
 
04:37:17.150 --> 04:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative uh Vice chairman McDonald
 
04:37:19.310 --> 04:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
04:37:23.109 --> 04:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
no thank you okay is there any um
 
04:37:26.629 --> 04:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
comments okay representative
 
04:37:31.109 --> 04:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
grund so one of my concerns about this
 
04:37:33.869 --> 04:37:33.879 align:start position:0%
is setting precedence
 
04:37:36.750 --> 04:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
to each year someone comes back and asks
 
04:37:38.551 --> 04:37:38.561 align:start position:0%
again and again and I do understand the
 
04:37:42.709 --> 04:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
concern over maybe a a MISD but I do I
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
am concerned on this one um and the idea
 
04:37:50.910 --> 04:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
of a retrospective bill um in the New
 
04:37:53.629 --> 04:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution part one article
 
04:37:56.470 --> 04:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
23 retrospective built laws are highly
 
04:37:58.590 --> 04:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
injures oppressive and unjust and no
 
04:38:00.709 --> 04:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
such laws therefore shall be made for
 
04:38:02.150 --> 04:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
either decision of civil causes or
 
04:38:04.869 --> 04:38:04.879 align:start position:0%
punishment offenses is a concern of
 
04:38:11.830 --> 04:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:14.590 --> 04:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
represent uh Vice chairman
 
04:38:18.510 --> 04:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you uh i' just like to uh
 
04:38:21.629 --> 04:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
talk about the retrospective laws uh
 
04:38:23.349 --> 04:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of court cases New
 
04:38:25.189 --> 04:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Court cases Norton versus
 
04:38:27.510 --> 04:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
Patton 125 New Hampshire
 
04:38:30.590 --> 04:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
413 and State versus Belo
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
125 New Hampshire
 
04:38:35.551 --> 04:38:35.561 align:start position:0%
304 um much like you I do some research
 
04:38:37.310 --> 04:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
on some of the cases and I don't have
 
04:38:40.949 --> 04:38:40.959 align:start position:0%
access to a uh a lot of uh case Maxs but
 
04:38:42.629 --> 04:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
I would look up all the cases so use
 
04:38:45.029 --> 04:38:45.039 align:start position:0%
Google and what these cases basically
 
04:38:48.029 --> 04:38:48.039 align:start position:0%
found was uh constitutional Hampshire
 
04:38:50.590 --> 04:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution retrospective laws the
 
04:38:53.429 --> 04:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
provisions in the hamster Constitution
 
04:38:56.150 --> 04:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
for excuse me forbidding retrospective
 
04:38:57.789 --> 04:38:57.799 align:start position:0%
or post-facto laws prohibits the
 
04:39:00.590 --> 04:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
enactment of any laws which create a new
 
04:39:03.551 --> 04:39:03.561 align:start position:0%
obligation impose a new Duty or attaches
 
04:39:05.390 --> 04:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
a new disability in respect to
 
04:39:07.789 --> 04:39:07.799 align:start position:0%
transactions already passed this bill
 
04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
does none of that okay when you think of
 
04:39:11.709 --> 04:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
something like that that it's like if
 
04:39:13.150 --> 04:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sitting in prison for burglary and
 
04:39:15.150 --> 04:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
they changed the burglar law I'm sitting
 
04:39:16.590 --> 04:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
there for seven years and I say now I
 
04:39:18.551 --> 04:39:18.561 align:start position:0%
get a s there for 10 years that's what
 
04:39:20.510 --> 04:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
that is this does nothing this bill does
 
04:39:23.869 --> 04:39:23.879 align:start position:0%
nothing like this it's actually to help
 
04:39:25.949 --> 04:39:25.959 align:start position:0%
help the nonprofits it's not penalizing
 
04:39:28.629 --> 04:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
them or giving this disabled or any of
 
04:39:30.789 --> 04:39:30.799 align:start position:0%
that other things uh so at this time I
 
04:39:34.070 --> 04:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't believe that the rospective law uh
 
04:39:36.708 --> 04:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:39.910 --> 04:39:39.920 align:start position:0%

04:39:47.470 --> 04:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald my is it isn't
 
04:39:49.910 --> 04:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
my my understanding that this is a
 
04:39:52.910 --> 04:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
one-time look back to
 
04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%

comments again I I I understand the
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill but I I I maintain my
 
04:40:09.430 --> 04:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
position that the the wording in this
 
04:40:13.470 --> 04:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
bill as amended just doesn't
 
04:40:16.390 --> 04:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
accomplish what the intent is that's
 
04:40:24.430 --> 04:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:28.190 --> 04:40:28.200 align:start position:0%

I the amendment does seem to answer one
 
04:44:50.190 --> 04:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
of the questions that we had in
 
04:44:52.230 --> 04:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
committee which is to allow the trust to
 
04:44:57.990 --> 04:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
claim the exemp the exemption so I am
 
04:45:01.390 --> 04:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
supportive of this amendment but we'll
 
04:45:02.788 --> 04:45:02.798 align:start position:0%

04:45:05.150 --> 04:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
supportive of that because this is one
 
04:45:07.990 --> 04:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
of the questions that was

raised and it answers the question
 
04:45:12.750 --> 04:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
further comments or
 
04:45:16.788 --> 04:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
discussion so um to to reiterate that
 
04:45:19.350 --> 04:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment reflects as you recall
 
04:45:21.430 --> 04:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
during the hearing the prime sponsor had
 
04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
noted that when she submitted the
 
04:45:29.830 --> 04:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
language to OS for the LSR that somehow
 
04:45:32.190 --> 04:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
the provision with regards to trust
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%

comments representative
 
04:47:50.150 --> 04:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
majority thank you m chairwoman uh so
 
04:47:51.310 --> 04:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
while supportive of the amendment
 
04:47:52.548 --> 04:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
because I do think the amendment makes
 
04:47:54.868 --> 04:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
the bill better um we heard numerous
 
04:47:56.390 --> 04:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
times in committee even from the prime
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor and from testimony that we
 
04:47:59.868 --> 04:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
received from the prime sponsor that the
 
04:48:01.350 --> 04:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars is probably not the
 
04:48:02.670 --> 04:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
right number and the number should be
 
04:48:04.948 --> 04:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
more like half a million dollars I mean
 
04:48:07.270 --> 04:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's even in the we have from the from
 
04:48:09.628 --> 04:48:09.638 align:start position:0%
the attorney so I'm not I don't oppose
 
04:48:11.150 --> 04:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
to increasing it but I don't see any
 
04:48:12.628 --> 04:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
evidence to where a million dollars is
 
04:48:14.868 --> 04:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
the right number and in fact to the
 
04:48:16.708 --> 04:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
again to the contrary where I see a half
 
04:48:18.910 --> 04:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
a million dollars is is probably the
 
04:48:22.110 --> 04:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
right number um so it's one of those
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
things where I I I just don't it just
 
04:48:26.948 --> 04:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like I have the evidence to
 
04:48:28.510 --> 04:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
support the bill as it has been
 
04:48:32.788 --> 04:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
presented thank you further comments
 
04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative stavis thank you madam
 
04:48:38.110 --> 04:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
chair and I feel not qualified to speak
 
04:48:39.788 --> 04:48:39.798 align:start position:0%
to this and since I wasn't at the
 
04:48:42.190 --> 04:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
hearing but in reviewing the bill
 
04:48:44.990 --> 04:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
afterwards I have some questions about
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
definitions that I don't believe were
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
answered uh in the hearing because I've
 
04:48:52.110 --> 04:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
asked and one of them is what is the
 
04:48:54.070 --> 04:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
definition of a housing
 
04:48:56.470 --> 04:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
cooperative and that is in line eight of
 
04:49:00.910 --> 04:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
the bill um it is is nowhere defined I
 
04:49:02.830 --> 04:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
can't find any reference to it in
 
04:49:06.030 --> 04:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
existing law I don't know what it
 
04:49:08.990 --> 04:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
is so I while I'm supportive of the
 
04:49:13.628 --> 04:49:13.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:13.638 --> 04:49:17.110 align:start position:0%
 
further

04:49:17.110 --> 04:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:20.628 --> 04:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
comments representative grund one of the
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
other concerns I remember was talking
 
04:49:25.350 --> 04:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
was brought up about um home housing
 
04:49:26.948 --> 04:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
cooperatives which I think is what
 
04:49:28.830 --> 04:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
you're talking about and it was
 
04:49:31.350 --> 04:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
referenced as HOAs and there was the
 
04:49:33.670 --> 04:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
concern about whether percentage of land
 
04:49:36.350 --> 04:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
in an HOA is now attached and things so
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
I am opposed to this bill for that
 
04:49:42.190 --> 04:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:42.200 --> 04:49:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:49:43.510 --> 04:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:49:46.190 --> 04:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
stavis um thank you representative grund
 
04:49:48.270 --> 04:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
and Madam chair with respect to
 
04:49:50.948 --> 04:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations this could be a
 
04:49:53.990 --> 04:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
disastrous bill because it it while it
 
04:49:56.510 --> 04:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
is true that in an HOA you own your land
 
04:49:58.670 --> 04:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
and you own the home you also own a
 
04:50:01.350 --> 04:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
percentage of the common land and a
 
04:50:03.230 --> 04:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
percentage of the open land that's
 
04:50:05.868 --> 04:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
required by the planning board to remain
 
04:50:09.548 --> 04:50:09.558 align:start position:0%
open in perpetuity and so any judgment
 
04:50:12.590 --> 04:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
Against One homeowner could put the
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:24.390 --> 04:50:24.400 align:start position:0%

chair

04:53:41.628 --> 04:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:53:45.030 --> 04:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
um the addition of the additional
 
04:53:48.628 --> 04:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
language um I understand that the
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
purpose uh was
 
04:53:55.510 --> 04:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
to simplify and clarify and it seems to
 
04:53:58.990 --> 04:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
do the opposite uh section B suggests
 
04:54:03.070 --> 04:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
adding vague language to RSA
 
04:54:05.910 --> 04:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
7223 uh which currently allows for tax
 
04:54:08.270 --> 04:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
exempt religious organizations to rent
 
04:54:10.830 --> 04:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
properties but here they're using using
 
04:54:15.070 --> 04:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
terms like similar Mission or
 
04:54:18.590 --> 04:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
um similar residential real estate and
 
04:54:20.948 --> 04:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
those terms are overly broad they are
 
04:54:23.470 --> 04:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
poorly defined and they just create
 
04:54:26.430 --> 04:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
significant ambiguity and then down in
 
04:54:29.548 --> 04:54:29.558 align:start position:0%
section c we're complicating matters
 
04:54:31.788 --> 04:54:31.798 align:start position:0%
further by imposing excessive
 
04:54:34.470 --> 04:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
requirements on organizations as well as
 
04:54:36.788 --> 04:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
Municipal assessors who are not
 
04:54:38.708 --> 04:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
certified public
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
accountants uh it fairly forces
 
04:54:43.830 --> 04:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
assessors to evaluate an organization's
 
04:54:47.390 --> 04:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
income and expenses in relation to the
 
04:54:49.948 --> 04:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
law uh this could lead to dep uh
 
04:54:52.190 --> 04:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
potential disputes placing unreasonable
 
04:54:54.030 --> 04:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
burdens on assessors who may lack the
 
04:54:56.788 --> 04:54:56.798 align:start position:0%
necessary time or expertise to perform
 
04:54:59.430 --> 04:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
Financial assessments uh the additional
 
04:55:00.948 --> 04:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
burdens coupled with overly broad
 
04:55:03.070 --> 04:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
terminology are likely to result in more
 
04:55:05.470 --> 04:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
confusion unequal application across
 
04:55:07.910 --> 04:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and would then worsen the
 
04:55:09.910 --> 04:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
very problem this bill attempts to
 
04:55:09.920 --> 04:55:13.270 align:start position:0%
very problem this bill attempts to
correct

04:55:13.270 --> 04:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:16.030 --> 04:55:16.040 align:start position:0%

Davis thank you madam chair um I'd like
 
04:55:23.430 --> 04:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
to also point out in section c of the
 
04:55:26.030 --> 04:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
bill that there's a a
 
04:55:29.548 --> 04:55:29.558 align:start position:0%
contradiction where uh in line 11 it a
 
04:55:31.510 --> 04:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
that rents not more than one church
 
04:55:33.628 --> 04:55:33.638 align:start position:0%
parsonage or similar residential real
 
04:55:36.910 --> 04:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
estate and or not more than one worship
 
04:55:39.230 --> 04:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
building and then at the end of that
 
04:55:41.708 --> 04:55:41.718 align:start position:0%
paragraph in line 17 it says an
 
04:55:43.750 --> 04:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
organization shall not claim more than
 
04:55:46.948 --> 04:55:46.958 align:start position:0%
one exemption under this s subparagraph
 
04:55:49.190 --> 04:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
when I read those two sentences together
 
04:55:51.750 --> 04:55:51.760 align:start position:0%

speak to your motion to accept the
 
04:59:05.750 --> 04:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
amendment yes thank you very much um I
 
04:59:08.150 --> 04:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
after speaking with the sponsor and
 
04:59:10.310 --> 04:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
taking a significant amount of input
 
04:59:13.830 --> 04:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
from uh from uh from one of our
 
04:59:16.190 --> 04:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
assessors from the town of Hudson um I'm
 
04:59:17.670 --> 04:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
afraid to name him I don't want to put
 
04:59:19.310 --> 04:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
him on the spot to do that but he's
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
sitting here so he might throw something
 
04:59:23.110 --> 04:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
at me if I do or don't uh anyway we took
 
04:59:24.868 --> 04:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
some some good input on this to try to
 
04:59:26.548 --> 04:59:26.558 align:start position:0%
find some language it it seemed like it
 
04:59:28.788 --> 04:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
would be easier than it was but to try
 
04:59:31.868 --> 04:59:31.878 align:start position:0%
to find some language that allows the
 
04:59:33.910 --> 04:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
municipality and the tax exempt
 
04:59:35.750 --> 04:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
organizations within that municipality
 
04:59:37.510 --> 04:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
to work together to make sure that the
 
04:59:40.990 --> 04:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
proper forms are sent and received
 
04:59:43.070 --> 04:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh sent by the municipality and received
 
04:59:45.190 --> 04:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
by the organization so the organization
 
04:59:47.548 --> 04:59:47.558 align:start position:0%
can then respond in a timely fashion and
 
04:59:49.470 --> 04:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
receive the exemption which then the
 
04:59:50.990 --> 04:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
municipality can make sure that they're
 
04:59:53.150 --> 04:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
qualified to receive and we think what
 
04:59:55.110 --> 04:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment um has done what we
 
04:59:57.150 --> 04:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
believe the amendment has done is it's
 
04:59:59.548 --> 04:59:59.558 align:start position:0%
referenced that the municipality the
 
05:00:01.948 --> 05:00:01.958 align:start position:0%
governing the municipality rather shall
 
05:00:03.990 --> 05:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
send the proper forms according to
 
05:00:05.910 --> 05:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
statute so we're not naming a specific
 
05:00:08.628 --> 05:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
form in case that form should change uh
 
05:00:11.350 --> 05:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
but stating where in the statute uh that
 
05:00:13.270 --> 05:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
the municipality should look that those
 
05:00:16.230 --> 05:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
couple of forms should be sent out in a
 
05:00:19.150 --> 05:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
timely fashion um so that the
 
05:00:21.310 --> 05:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
municipality can then consider but or
 
05:00:26.070 --> 05:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
not a but and the uh that neither the
 
05:00:28.350 --> 05:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
municipality nor the
 
05:00:31.390 --> 05:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
organization uh shall be penalized if
 
05:00:33.470 --> 05:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
there happens to be yet another oops
 
05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
maybe it wasn't received on time maybe
 
05:00:37.150 --> 05:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
it was sent on time but the mail was
 
05:00:39.990 --> 05:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
slow and and it happened in return also
 
05:00:41.310 --> 05:00:41.320 align:start position:0%
so so we want to make sure that they're
 
05:00:45.070 --> 05:00:45.080 align:start position:0%
not penalized uh in that and as we spoke
 
05:00:47.708 --> 05:00:47.718 align:start position:0%
before about a different Bill uh last
 
05:00:51.070 --> 05:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
year House Bill 1055 was
 
05:00:54.788 --> 05:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
passed um and that was in response to uh
 
05:00:58.470 --> 05:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations that did not
 
05:01:00.708 --> 05:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
get their forms in on time and there was
 
05:01:02.670 --> 05:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
nothing in statute that allowed the
 
05:01:05.750 --> 05:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
governing body the latitude to grant
 
05:01:08.030 --> 05:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
them the exemp exemption nothing in
 
05:01:10.110 --> 05:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
statute they had to be denied happened
 
05:01:13.788 --> 05:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
in my own town the what this bill does
 
05:01:17.110 --> 05:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
what house bill 421 does is it just says
 
05:01:19.670 --> 05:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
Hey municipality organization work
 
05:01:21.670 --> 05:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
together let's try to avoid that problem
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
from ever happening again we think that
 
05:01:26.910 --> 05:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment does that um and does it
 
05:01:29.548 --> 05:01:29.558 align:start position:0%
in a way that satisfies both organiz or
 
05:01:31.150 --> 05:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
both organizations so I would hope that
 
05:01:33.510 --> 05:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
you would pass the amendment and if I
 
05:01:35.590 --> 05:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
said anything wrong jisho now will throw
 
05:01:41.070 --> 05:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:45.350 --> 05:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:48.390 --> 05:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none the the mo oh I'm
 
05:01:52.270 --> 05:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
sorry who who oh representative Walker I
 
05:01:54.830 --> 05:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
do think the uh making the assessing
 
05:01:57.390 --> 05:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
office send out mailers is an undue
 
05:01:59.910 --> 05:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
burden to that office both in their
 
05:02:01.910 --> 05:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
budget cost wise and the time to make
 
05:02:05.350 --> 05:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
the mailers up I do think the underlying
 
05:02:08.230 --> 05:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
problem with this whole law is why is it
 
05:02:09.868 --> 05:02:09.878 align:start position:0%
you have to put these paperwork in
 
05:02:13.750 --> 05:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
yearly why can't it be five years or t
 
05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
two by annually having it to do it every
 
05:02:21.070 --> 05:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
year seems dumb that's all I just have
 
05:02:21.080 --> 05:02:22.868 align:start position:0%
year seems dumb that's all I just have
to

05:02:22.868 --> 05:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:02:27.070 --> 05:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:30.190 --> 05:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
discussion oh represent a majority thank
 
05:02:33.708 --> 05:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
you again um to my friend from Rochester
 
05:02:36.670 --> 05:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
I I agree with you and would add that
 
05:02:38.110 --> 05:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
when I was on the budget committee we
 
05:02:40.670 --> 05:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
reviewed all of the tax exempt
 
05:02:44.070 --> 05:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
organizations annually to make sure that
 
05:02:46.868 --> 05:02:46.878 align:start position:0%
they were still qualified to be tax
 
05:02:48.910 --> 05:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
exempt organizations under under their
 
05:02:51.310 --> 05:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
Charter or whatever reasons so I think
 
05:02:53.750 --> 05:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
you're you're both right but I would but
 
05:02:55.310 --> 05:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
we may need to look at that a little bit
 
05:02:57.190 --> 05:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
further to figure out a way so that we
 
05:02:59.430 --> 05:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
don't have to continue to do this or I
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with you at all that
 
05:03:03.470 --> 05:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
you're asking the community right now to
 
05:03:06.270 --> 05:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
send out mail which is a burden to the
 
05:03:08.750 --> 05:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
municipality so I don't I don't that's
 
05:03:12.830 --> 05:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
that's not falling on Def years so thank
 
05:03:15.948 --> 05:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
you further
 
05:03:18.270 --> 05:03:18.280 align:start position:0%

make a motion to retain House Bill 458
 
05:09:32.270 --> 05:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
is there a second Madame chair I like to
 
05:09:34.270 --> 05:09:34.280 align:start position:0%
second that uh representative Murphy
 
05:09:36.310 --> 05:09:36.320 align:start position:0%

05:09:38.628 --> 05:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion yes
 
05:09:39.868 --> 05:09:39.878 align:start position:0%
this needs a
 
05:09:42.350 --> 05:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of work
 
05:09:45.230 --> 05:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be retained to be worked
 
05:09:45.240 --> 05:09:46.390 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be retained to be worked
on

05:09:46.390 --> 05:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:09:50.910 --> 05:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
later further comments on
 
05:09:54.070 --> 05:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Dolan thank you
 
05:09:58.590 --> 05:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair this was a case where uh the
 
05:10:01.830 --> 05:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
neither the sponsor nor any co-sponsor
 
05:10:05.868 --> 05:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
showed up uh and which put I believe
 
05:10:07.788 --> 05:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
puts puts the committee at a severe
 
05:10:10.270 --> 05:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
disadvantage to be able to elicit
 
05:10:13.708 --> 05:10:13.718 align:start position:0%
information about the bill I think in
 
05:10:17.750 --> 05:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
most cases when that situation arises we
 
05:10:19.628 --> 05:10:19.638 align:start position:0%
ought to give strong consideration to an
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
itl motion however in this case I will
 
05:10:26.270 --> 05:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
side with uh leadership and and support
 
05:10:26.280 --> 05:10:27.910 align:start position:0%
side with uh leadership and and support
the

05:10:27.910 --> 05:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:10:31.590 --> 05:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:33.868 --> 05:10:33.878 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
05:10:36.350 --> 05:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair I continue
 
05:10:38.230 --> 05:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
to think that when a sponsor doesn't
 
05:10:40.548 --> 05:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
show up to present their bill or take
 
05:10:43.868 --> 05:10:43.878 align:start position:0%
questions on their bill that it as my
 
05:10:45.948 --> 05:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
colleague says puts this committee at a
 
05:10:47.868 --> 05:10:47.878 align:start position:0%
severe disadvantage it also puts the
 
05:10:50.030 --> 05:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire at a severe
 
05:10:52.350 --> 05:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
disadvantage because they don't have the
 
05:10:55.030 --> 05:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hear us ask questions on
 
05:10:55.040 --> 05:10:55.910 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hear us ask questions on
their

05:10:55.910 --> 05:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:11:00.628 --> 05:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
behalf um so I I will support the retain
 
05:11:02.990 --> 05:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
motion but I think in the future we
 
05:11:04.750 --> 05:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
should have a conversation and a
 
05:11:06.470 --> 05:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
discussion about what happens when
 
05:11:08.628 --> 05:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
sponsors don't show because several
 
05:11:10.948 --> 05:11:10.958 align:start position:0%
several of them have
 
05:11:13.910 --> 05:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
not thank you representative stavis um
 
05:11:13.920 --> 05:11:16.350 align:start position:0%
not thank you representative stavis um
further

05:11:16.350 --> 05:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:11:20.270 --> 05:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
comments so I I I'll add a comment and
 
05:11:22.430 --> 05:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
I'll support the motion to retain due to
 
05:11:24.868 --> 05:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
the fact that we had another bill that
 
05:11:28.708 --> 05:11:28.718 align:start position:0%
was similar to this and the thought is
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
perhaps we want to kind look at both of
 
05:11:30.958 --> 05:11:32.430 align:start position:0%
perhaps we want to kind look at both of
them

05:11:32.430 --> 05:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:11:36.990 --> 05:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:39.670 --> 05:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none the most motion
 
05:11:44.948 --> 05:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:48.948 --> 05:11:48.958 align:start position:0%

05:13:00.430 --> 05:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
yes the motion to retain passes with a
 
05:13:04.230 --> 05:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
vote of 13 to5 and there's no reports on
 
05:13:07.750 --> 05:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
retain bills at this time so with that I
 
05:13:10.510 --> 05:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
will close the executive session on

this bill um particularly uh tying the

amount of the um exemption to the CPI I
 
05:14:34.830 --> 05:14:34.840 align:start position:0%

miss the hearing for this bill but I
 
05:15:52.670 --> 05:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
have a question about the definition of
 
05:15:55.628 --> 05:15:55.638 align:start position:0%
efficacy uh I mean what in Heaven's name
 
05:15:58.948 --> 05:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
does that mean in this context is it
 
05:16:01.830 --> 05:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
quantity of tax exemptions granted is it
 
05:16:03.830 --> 05:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
the benefit to the people who receive
 
05:16:06.910 --> 05:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
the exemptions is it the I mean what
 
05:16:12.510 --> 05:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:15.030 --> 05:16:15.040 align:start position:0%

forgot that lost my tip of my tip of my
 
05:16:23.788 --> 05:16:23.798 align:start position:0%
tongue um yeah what is the definition of
 
05:16:27.030 --> 05:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
e efficacy really is uh an important
 
05:16:31.150 --> 05:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
part of um how valuable this tool may be
 
05:16:33.628 --> 05:16:33.638 align:start position:0%
um we don't know and the prime sponsor
 
05:16:36.548 --> 05:16:36.558 align:start position:0%

05:16:39.510 --> 05:16:39.520 align:start position:0%

speak to your motion sure I will be as
 
05:19:24.670 --> 05:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
brief as possible um there was a diff a
 
05:19:29.670 --> 05:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
split of 5050 before basically the covid
 
05:19:31.750 --> 05:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
era from the federal government for
 
05:19:34.948 --> 05:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of nursing homes uh during
 
05:19:38.110 --> 05:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
the covid time period there was a change
 
05:19:41.030 --> 05:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
in the split to 56.2% from the federal
 
05:19:43.750 --> 05:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
government um and that difference of the
 
05:19:45.948 --> 05:19:45.958 align:start position:0%
6.2% went to the state but was never
 
05:19:47.788 --> 05:19:47.798 align:start position:0%
given back down to the counties the
 
05:19:49.390 --> 05:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
counties are owed this money and it
 
05:19:51.670 --> 05:19:51.680 align:start position:0%

questions uh represented majority did I
 
05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
get my dates wrong again no
 
05:22:45.190 --> 05:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
no I had from last week sorry I had from
 
05:22:47.070 --> 05:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
last week and it could be certainly
 
05:22:49.150 --> 05:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
could be me I always blame me first I
 
05:22:51.590 --> 05:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
put in the 26th for hearing you're
 
05:22:54.788 --> 05:22:54.798 align:start position:0%
saying the 27th so just to be
 
05:22:57.948 --> 05:22:57.958 align:start position:0%
clear when I say scheduled that means
 
05:23:00.430 --> 05:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
it's actually scheduled and it's been
 
05:23:03.270 --> 05:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
publicly noticed when I say please
 
05:23:06.350 --> 05:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
hold that means that that's tenative
 
05:23:08.990 --> 05:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
because we share resource
 
05:23:11.708 --> 05:23:11.718 align:start position:0%
and this is why we're in this room today
 
05:23:18.350 --> 05:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
so um I did put in the request
 
05:23:21.948 --> 05:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
yesterday um so that should be um being
 
05:23:24.110 --> 05:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
that should be scheduled for the 27th
 
05:23:27.270 --> 05:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
but that's what I put in and yes I did
 
05:23:30.590 --> 05:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
when I was looking forward PRI in Prior
 
05:23:32.990 --> 05:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
weeks I wasn't sure when where that was
 
05:23:34.788 --> 05:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
going to land and I pick Thursday
 
05:23:37.430 --> 05:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
because that gives us like a week that
 
05:23:39.270 --> 05:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
gives us more than instead of putting it
 
05:23:41.910 --> 05:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
at the head front of the
 
05:23:45.628 --> 05:23:45.638 align:start position:0%
week no no
 
05:23:48.750 --> 05:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
no does this is it better for me not to
 
05:23:50.590 --> 05:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
say anything until it's actually
 
05:23:53.110 --> 05:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
scheduled no seriously I'm trying to
 
05:23:56.350 --> 05:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
give you guys a heads up Madam chair yes
 
05:24:00.190 --> 05:24:00.200 align:start position:0%

request and I don't know if it's
 
05:24:30.230 --> 05:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
processed yet it should be it hasn't
 
05:24:32.190 --> 05:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
been public did you all receive a notice
 
05:24:37.070 --> 05:24:37.080 align:start position:0%

05:24:39.670 --> 05:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
too specific but we're penciling in
 
05:24:40.868 --> 05:24:40.878 align:start position:0%

05:24:45.788 --> 05:24:45.798 align:start position:0%
problem with the committee assistant
 
05:24:48.150 --> 05:24:48.160 align:start position:0%

05:24:58.510 --> 05:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
it's the 27th of Thursday that's what it
 
05:25:00.910 --> 05:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
should be because I did put in that
 
05:25:03.830 --> 05:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
request but it to be completely clear it
 
05:25:06.750 --> 05:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't been officially noticed
 
05:25:10.510 --> 05:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
yet sorry to be so
 
05:25:14.070 --> 05:25:14.080 align:start position:0%

Gilman can you repeat the the March date
 
05:25:23.430 --> 05:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
because that that went right past me
 
05:25:26.708 --> 05:25:26.718 align:start position:0%
while I was okay so I am looking ahead
 
05:25:29.310 --> 05:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm saying pencil
 
05:25:32.310 --> 05:25:32.320 align:start position:0%

05:25:38.590 --> 05:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
hearings and executive session on Monday
 
05:25:42.590 --> 05:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
March 3rd okay and that's pencil in
 
05:25:44.670 --> 05:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
because when I go to put in that request
 
05:25:51.390 --> 05:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:55.868 --> 05:25:55.878 align:start position:0%
oh well can we talk offline yes
 
05:25:58.990 --> 05:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
n and and yes that is corre did did we
 
05:26:00.868 --> 05:26:00.878 align:start position:0%
get that email notice
 
05:26:04.470 --> 05:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
yet okay and I do recall yes it is at 9:
 
05:26:07.270 --> 05:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of bills we have a
 
05:26:09.150 --> 05:26:09.160 align:start position:0%
an aggressive schedule
 
05:26:11.948 --> 05:26:11.958 align:start position:0%
so yes I do
 
05:26:15.548 --> 05:26:15.558 align:start position:0%
what the 27th all right maybe I
 
05:26:18.350 --> 05:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:18.360 --> 05:26:22.990 align:start position:0%
 
to

05:26:22.990 --> 05:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:25.510 --> 05:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
okay well I feel like I'm confusing some
 
05:26:27.310 --> 05:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
people I'm trying to help
 
05:26:30.430 --> 05:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
but when help gets confusing then I
 
05:26:33.190 --> 05:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
question whether it's helpful or
 
05:26:33.200 --> 05:26:34.830 align:start position:0%
question whether it's helpful or
not

05:26:34.830 --> 05:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:26:37.990 --> 05:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay so yes representative Dolan as I
 
05:26:41.070 --> 05:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
Rec call we were starting on Thursday
 
05:26:44.510 --> 05:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
February 27th at 9: because we have
 
05:26:47.910 --> 05:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:51.110 --> 05:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
bills I did not um I did not put in a
 
05:26:53.948 --> 05:26:53.958 align:start position:0%
scheduling request
 
05:26:56.510 --> 05:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
yet so I I don't
 
05:27:00.590 --> 05:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
know it's either going to be 9: or
 
05:27:04.990 --> 05:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
