00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
the well you're here to talk about
 
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
whatever you want you know
 
00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 align:start position:0%
um I like to hear first though from
 
00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 align:start position:0%
Emily Barker representing the um Board
 
00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
oh okay so how's Will 655 as you know
 
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
was a pretty beefy bill
 
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
and all of House Bill 655 was in house
 
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
bill 2. the trailer builds the budget
 
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
and so what we've done to make this a
 
00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh reasonable from from our community
 
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint is that we took all the
 
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 align:start position:0%
repeal portion of house bill in House
 
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 655 and we took that out
 
00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 align:start position:0%
the repeal portion of house bill 655. is
 
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
taken out
 
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.729 align:start position:0%
taken out
okay

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
all that is gone
 
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 65 655 is meant to codify
 
00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in oplc on the
 
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
organizational level and not on the
 
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
okay and then House Bill 2
 
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
still has those portions of the repeal
 
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
in it and this committee will have a
 
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
work session on that on Friday at two
 
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
o'clock so we're essentially dividing
 
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
the bill in half
 
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
the oplc portion
 
00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 align:start position:0%
and the board portion
 
00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.809 align:start position:0%
and the board portion
okay

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so please miss Barker
 
00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 align:start position:0%
we need that because I never speak up
 
00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 align:start position:0%
enough I'm Emily Baker I'm a physician
 
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 align:start position:0%
and the current president for the Board
 
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
of Medicine and I submit submitted a
 
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
document that at your pleasure to read
 
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
so in the um I believe in
 
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 because this has been
 
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
removed from this part of the bill has
 
00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
been removed from house bill 655.
 
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
so um do you have some comments about
 
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.930 align:start position:0%
so um do you have some comments about
the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
medical review board can you speak to
 
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 align:start position:0%
that because it says a component that
 
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
was in House Bill 655 and we'd like your
 
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 align:start position:0%
input on that yeah sure
 
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
the medical abuse subcommittee is
 
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
established in statute currently
 
00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
also comprised of licensees and public
 
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.550 align:start position:0%
also comprised of licensees and public
members

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 align:start position:0%
and does investigations on complaints
 
00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 align:start position:0%
that come in through and right now they
 
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
come in through the office of oplc
 
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.330 align:start position:0%
come in through the office of oplc
and

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding at least from my read
 
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 align:start position:0%
of hb2 was that that would the intent
 
00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 align:start position:0%
was for that to go away
 
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
and my second paragraph in my document
 
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
lends the boards
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
support for some version of a panel
 
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
to review complaints and assist in
 
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.310 align:start position:0%
to review complaints and assist in
investigations

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
and I describe what I think is sort of
 
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
in the value of a panel and it's similar
 
00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
to any board where you have more than
 
00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
one individual who has potential for
 
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
expertise to talk about an investigation
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
and make a recommendation
 
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
and whether or not
 
00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 align:start position:0%
that continues in the form of where it
 
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
stands in statute currently or falls
 
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
under the Aegis of the oplc with details
 
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
sorry okay so on Friday that's going to
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
be part of the discussion at two o'clock
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
so if you could come back yeah that
 
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate would be an
 
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate conversation to have at that
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
time that's great I will okay thank you
 
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to bring some more copies of
 
00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
the document I have no idea if you're
 
00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
the exact same group it will be the same
 
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
group and um
 
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
I think what I'll let I'll let the
 
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
committee know when we meet to save this
 
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
document for Friday okay
 
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
not cut down any more trees exactly
 
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anything else that
 
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
you'd like to say did you have any
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
questions about the review of the
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
applicants the first part of my
 
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
good morning Representatives Shane
 
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
Goulet attorney for the office of
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
I am board counsel to the Board of
 
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
Medicine I just wanted to comment on the
 
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
board's position as it relates to the
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
Authority for issuing licenses there was
 
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
a portion in Dr Baker's letter and
 
00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 align:start position:0%
submissions as it relates to that it's
 
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
unclear as to what that would look like
 
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
in totality but the board was concerned
 
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
with the ability to review certain
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
specific applications as it relates to
 
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
ones that include past disciplinary
 
00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 align:start position:0%
actions in other state criminal history
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
it's not specific I know that it
 
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
illustrates that it would require input
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
and objective standards that were
 
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
created by the board so it might not be
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
problematic but it was certainly a
 
00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 align:start position:0%
concern of the board that certain
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
applications would absolutely need to be
 
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
before the board that contain that type
 
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
okay I'll make a note of that
 
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
this is the accept committee have any
 
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.270 align:start position:0%
this is the accept committee have any
questions

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair
 
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone uh pardon my being
 
00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:16.259 align:start position:0%
a little bit late
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
um so I'm concerned uh with regard to uh
 
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
this the smoothness of the uh the
 
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
procedure that we're potentially
 
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
embarking on here because uh you know I
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
I've been on this committee now for 17
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
years I I saw the
 
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
office of Professional Licensing and
 
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
certification come in
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
roughly 10 or 11 years ago
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
and it was a was a very new operation
 
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of rough edges I don't
 
00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
know how many of you were here at that
 
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
time uh but now we're embarking on
 
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
something new uh in terms of of
 
00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
procedure at least and my question is
 
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
whether uh what this the workability is
 
00:08:07.089 --> 00:08:07.099 align:start position:0%
going to be as good as uh as it may be
 
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:10.220 align:start position:0%
after you've
 
00:08:13.089 --> 00:08:13.099 align:start position:0%
taken off the rough edges so to speak
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
and do do anticipate uh an easy
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
transition a smooth transition to the
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
new procedures or are there certain
 
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:25.740 align:start position:0%
aspects that uh that you haven't even
 
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
encountered yet or haven't thought about
 
00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:31.379 align:start position:0%
uh and so can you can you speak to that
 
00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
because I am concerned that especially
 
00:08:35.339 --> 00:08:35.930 align:start position:0%
because I am concerned that especially
um

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
the the licensees you're you're going to
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
be working into it
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
um and you'll have repeated instances of
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
it because you're doing it every day or
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
every week some of the people will be
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
coming in they won't have seen it at all
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm wondering whether they're
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
going to go like I am I'm used to
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
turning right at this corner like the
 
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:00.140 align:start position:0%
old milk horse I'm way too old for uh
 
00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
for this group in terms of Mill courses
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
but I remember the milk course used to
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
turn right at this corner doesn't want
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
to turn left in the new Administration
 
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
I I just want to be clear representative
 
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
um that I am employed by the office of
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
but my capacity here and my capacity
 
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
within that agency is specific to the
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
boards uh I represent the boards in
 
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
their capacity
 
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
um and my testimony here is specific and
 
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
relative to the Board of Medicine I can
 
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
say from a process and procedure
 
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
standpoint as it relates to how the
 
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine has interacted with
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
the office and I defer to Dr Baker to
 
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
correct me if I State anything
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
inaccurately that it relates to the you
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
know expeditious
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
or more uh expedient issuance of
 
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
licenses the Board of Medicine is
 
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:57.899 align:start position:0%
working directly with the office to
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
ensure that that occurs kind of hand in
 
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
glove and I I think that the board has
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
been satisfied by the efforts that the
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
office has been making in relation to
 
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
that is as evidenced by the testimony
 
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
submitted by Dr Baker in creating
 
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
matrices we do have the Board of
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
Medicine does have a compact which does
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
allow for the expeditious issuance of
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
licenses by the office currently the
 
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine is all also authorized
 
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
the office to
 
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:27.829 align:start position:0%
the office to
um

00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
have a matrix if you will on what needs
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
to come before the board and what does
 
00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
not to expediate the or to kind of make
 
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
the licensing process go faster is that
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
a fair and accurate assessment of the
 
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
if you're make sure I've understand your
 
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
question right of whether or not we
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
feel that we're going to have be able to
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
work on this easily with the board I
 
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
mean we've had with the oplc we're
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
already working with them and feel
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable with their staff and our
 
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:06.740 align:start position:0%
made changes and are adapting that
 
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
off as well and I imagine
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
there may be issues and it's one of
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
those things where I don't know what I
 
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
don't know and if something comes up I
 
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
think the board has the ability to adapt
 
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
with the oplc what I can't say is what
 
00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:27.140 align:start position:0%
license our licensees would experience
 
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
our intent our job is to protect the
 
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.810 align:start position:0%
our intent our job is to protect the
public

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
and whether or not the licensees find it
 
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
comfortable and about the role of the
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
oplc is of secondary importance
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
so that if we can get our job done well
 
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
with the current structure we will work
 
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
with it absolutely and I don't have any
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:55.250 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much time you want to
 
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
spend on any of this man I'm sure
 
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
another three minutes would be good okay
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to defer until later
 
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Elizabeth Eaton
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
I'm also an attorney with the office of
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm here representing three boards
 
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.490 align:start position:0%
and I'm here representing three boards
today

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
um I represent the Midwifery Council and
 
00:13:07.569 --> 00:13:07.579 align:start position:0%
I have written testimony on their behalf
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
I'm here for the board of natural
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
scientists and I have written testimony
 
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
on their behalf as well as the Board of
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
Nursing with again written testimony on
 
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
their behalf with the
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
change here to the bill
 
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony may not apply
 
00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
right now we'd have to kind of go back
 
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
and reevaluate but I would love to give
 
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
these um this testimony to you on behalf
 
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
of these boards and
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that I need to explain
 
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
much more than that okay and this will
 
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
be discussed from Friday because this is
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
to do with the repeal section of the
 
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
bill some of it does correct um I would
 
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:49.940 align:start position:0%
say that the board of natural scientists
 
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.490 align:start position:0%
say that the board of natural scientists
has

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:51.500 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
concerns about the application review
 
00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
process similar to The Board of Medicine
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
and so that would apply even with the
 
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
without even when you're taking out the
 
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.170 align:start position:0%
without even when you're taking out the
repeals

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
repeals
 
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
because licensing is Shifting in that
 
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:06.740 align:start position:0%
first section under oplc
 
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.569 align:start position:0%
first section under oplc
[Music]

00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
um otherwise I'd have to take a look at
 
00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
what we've written here and and really
 
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
okay so anything that so I should say
 
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
this is this is the process that
 
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:19.740 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and I have
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
the house bills 465 Amendment will have
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
everything that's in House Bill 465 plus
 
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
some comments that were made at the last
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
committee meeting up until the repeal
 
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.090 align:start position:0%
committee meeting up until the repeal
section

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
that part of the hospital for 655 will
 
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
be taken out of house bill 2. and it
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
will stand alone on its own
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
the repeal section we're going to take a
 
00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
look at that and make comments on that
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
at any amendments that have to be made
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 2 will be made as a
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
non-germanic amendment to a bill that we
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
will have retained in this committee
 
00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
right so that
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
if we don't get it all right the first
 
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
time around we can amend whatever
 
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
amendments need to be done
 
00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
we'll do over the summer for the next
 
00:15:11.699 --> 00:15:12.949 align:start position:0%
we'll do over the summer for the next
year

00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
says that does everybody understand that
 
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
okay good thanks certainly I I guess
 
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
coming here I didn't know that those
 
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
parts were going to be correct you know
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm here on behalf of boards who
 
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
took votes to send testimony and so I'm
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
just going to send the testimony as it
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
is yes uh and then we can go from there
 
00:15:35.329 --> 00:15:35.339 align:start position:0%

the subcommittee to discuss this so
 
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
um do you have any comments in addition
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
to the email that you sent to us uh yes
 
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
I do especially since you're looking at
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
splitting it this way yeah
 
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:26.220 align:start position:0%
um if you were to look in my email there
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
is an attached document of suggested
 
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
edits for the um the bill and especially
 
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
they also I have seen the revision
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
suggested by actually you your name is
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
on it now
 
00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:16:42.779 --> 00:16:43.430 align:start position:0%
um and
um

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
there are things that
 
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
the board of mental health practice and
 
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
the board of psychology I'm speaking I'm
 
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
Dr Deborah Warner I'm in Littleton I'm
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
speaking as an individual I'm very well
 
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
informed about these board things having
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
been involved in boards but I'm speaking
 
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
as an individual just want to make it
 
00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:01.940 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
there are things that those two boys I
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
did about 12 years ago about the same
 
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
time oplc was generated that were
 
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
Advanced and are especially good ways of
 
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
conducting board business and things
 
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
like protecting patient rights and
 
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
medical records privacy which did get
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
put into this revision as well as other
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
things like the
 
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.850 align:start position:0%
things like the
um

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
the protection of the allegation status
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
and the disclosure about that and things
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
like that that are very important and I
 
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
believe should be promulgated across the
 
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
boards and I think it would be good to
 
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
include it in the first sections the 310
 
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
sections that are being separated out
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
from the other parts that are the
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
repeals because I think they're just
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
very good ways to do this across Sports
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
some things in the first portion the 310
 
00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
section that particularly alarmed me are
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
in the 310 colon 9 where the board the
 
00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:03.620 align:start position:0%
oplc is allowed to initiate
 
00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:06.260 align:start position:0%
investigations of its own
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
and not requiring a board order where
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
it's structured and has charges to be
 
00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:18.299 align:start position:0%
investigated and inquired about and that
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
there'd be limitations to that process
 
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
and the concern with that is that oplc
 
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
or any state agency that doesn't have
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
guard rails like that can do
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
investigations on whim they can do it on
 
00:18:32.289 --> 00:18:32.299 align:start position:0%
on their own
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
bias or whatever there could be I think
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
we have a good functioning oplc office
 
00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:39.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not charging them with anything but
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
without it being in the law I think it
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
could get out of hand and I don't think
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
we want that to happen so various of my
 
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
my things if you were to look at my
 
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
attachment that has edits for the three
 
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
tens I believe that those are very
 
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
germane to the portion that you're
 
00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
looking at keeping in this Bill thank
 
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
you thank you does anyone have any
 
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.409 align:start position:0%
you thank you does anyone have any
questions

00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:03.419 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
no okay thank you all right thank you
 
00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:09.860 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak uh attorney
 
00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:12.539 align:start position:0%
osterhound or executive director
 
00:19:12.539 --> 00:19:26.270 align:start position:0%
osterhound or executive director
Courtney

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
you know what I don't need pink cards I
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the convenience but
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
this is not like a real this is a
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing so we don't
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to really save them
 
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.029 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to really save them
perfect

00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
um well then thank you madam chair for
 
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:44.220 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Lindsay Courtney
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of The Office
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
of professional life insurance
 
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
certification and with me at general
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
counsel Douglas osterhout
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
gotta correct this time
 
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.590 align:start position:0%
gotta correct this time
um

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:57.409 --> 00:19:57.419 align:start position:0%
so essentially the proposed amendment
 
00:19:57.419 --> 00:19:59.110 align:start position:0%
so essentially the proposed amendment
would

00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:20:02.169 --> 00:20:02.179 align:start position:0%
eliminate all of the proposed repeals
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
that are presently in 655 and just focus
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
on the recodification of oplc and 310.
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
practically I think as I've expressed
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
before it's quite difficult for
 
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
individuals to know where to look when
 
00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:18.299 align:start position:0%
it comes to oplc's Authority because
 
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
it's tucked up before all of the other
 
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:22.940 align:start position:0%
technical statutes in
 
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
310a1a and so I think recodification is
 
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
just necessary in order to provide that
 
00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:30.299 align:start position:0%
transparency as to what law actually
 
00:20:30.299 --> 00:20:31.549 align:start position:0%
transparency as to what law actually
applies

00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
applies
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
additionally one of the objectives that
 
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%
I think oplc has and certainly I think
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
has been expressed in legislation
 
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
throughout the last several years is
 
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
that there's a need to streamline the
 
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
way we do business in the office and so
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
this proposed amendment really provides
 
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
a consistent regulatory framework for
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
how the licensing boards are supposed to
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
operate both with respect to licensing
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
and with respect to discipline now
 
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
because the repeals are not proposed
 
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
here there would still be some conflicts
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
in the law and I think certainly the
 
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
boards that do have conflicting
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
Provisions there would be an opportunity
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
for them to rely on those statutes to
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
some extent we'd have to do that legal
 
00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
analysis but I think it provides a
 
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
pathway for us to start streamlining and
 
00:21:21.049 --> 00:21:21.059 align:start position:0%
consolidating the way we do business and
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
I think frankly it's pretty necessary
 
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
you know given our limited resources
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
regarding Dr Warner's specific concerns
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
I we the proposed statute does not
 
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
contain specifically the statutory
 
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.010 align:start position:0%
contain specifically the statutory
um

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:36.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
requirements that there be an allegation
 
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
and then that's elevated to a complaint
 
00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
practically that's the way our
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
investigations are already handled
 
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
essentially they are screened there's a
 
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
determination of whether or not they can
 
00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
um once it's determined that the Acclaim
 
00:21:57.409 --> 00:21:57.419 align:start position:0%
has been is potentially viable then it
 
00:21:59.710 --> 00:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
there's an order of formal investigation
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
in the psychology context that would be
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
when an order of formal investigation
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
would issue and be elevated to
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
complaints so practically I don't see a
 
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.450 align:start position:0%
complaints so practically I don't see a
distinction

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
in terms of the guardrails for
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
investigation I would say the guardrails
 
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
are what the guardrails are for the
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
board and that our investigative
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
Authority would be limited to to
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not there's been
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
a violation of something within the
 
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
board's jurisdiction we don't have
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
plenary powers we're not a police we're
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
not a law enforcement agency so
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
certainly there are significant
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
limitations on what we would be able to
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
do I'll turn it over to Douglas to see
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
if he has any other
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
um items I hate link to adjust
 
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that after Friday when we
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
review the rest of House Bill 2 those
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
conflicts will go away
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know between the amendment so I hope
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
you'll be here on Friday I certainly
 
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
plan on playing hair party okay great
 
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
great great great
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative Schmidt
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
again I I want to consult with the chair
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
with regard to how much we're going to
 
00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
get into details here uh and how much is
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
going to be deferred until Friday uh but
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
um for those of you who are relatively
 
00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
recent to the whole process uh you may
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
not be aware that you know there there
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
is a history involved in some of this uh
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm concerned about and
 
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:27.299 align:start position:0%
specifically uh you know the the board
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
of mental health practice originally
 
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
grew out long before I came into the
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
legislature out of the board of
 
00:23:35.409 --> 00:23:35.419 align:start position:0%
psychologists okay
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
and gradually over the years uh in the
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
somewhat distant past the board of
 
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
mental health practice grew up around
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
what had originally been the board of
 
00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:48.250 align:start position:0%
what had originally been the board of
psychology

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:48.260 align:start position:0%
psychology
 
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
and about roughly 10 years ago the
 
00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
psychologist came in uh to Edna and they
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
said with an uh the new bill saying this
 
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
is not really working we need to have
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
our own board and and the LED and this
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
committee looked at this very carefully
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
and ultimately determined that we were
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
going to give the psychologists their
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
own board again and keep the board of
 
00:24:18.409 --> 00:24:18.419 align:start position:0%
mental health uh practice intact except
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
for the removal of the board of
 
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
psychology now we're talking about
 
00:24:24.649 --> 00:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
putting that back together again and I
 
00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039 align:start position:0%
have real concerns as to whether this is
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
uh you know a solution in search of a
 
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
problem because to some degree to the to
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
the ASP that to the degree that we are
 
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
trying to get more efficient and and and
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
smoother and easier and more uniform
 
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
that there's some theoretical benefit to
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
that but in the Practical world the
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
question I have is is it is the return
 
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
on investment really justified by the
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
amount of disruption that may be caused
 
00:24:59.770 --> 00:24:59.780 align:start position:0%
by this process
 
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
and this is something that that I think
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
we have to give some consideration to to
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
see whether we're spending a dollar to
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
get you know uh 50 cents worth of
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
benefit and whether we're in enhancing
 
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
our procedures at the expense of the
 
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
practitioners and the public so I want I
 
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
want everybody to be mindful of this
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
particular aspect to see whether we are
 
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
getting bang for the buck and and if you
 
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
can speak to any of those aspects at
 
00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
this time I'm I would be happy to hear
 
00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
that if Friday is better I'm willing to
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
wait until then as well thank you
 
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative I I can speak to the fact
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
that the proposed changes that you speak
 
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
of are not in this bill and not in this
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment they're in hb2
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
certainly but not in this proposed
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
amendment this proposed amendment would
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
impact the current structure of any of
 
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
those boards it would just provide a
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
consistent way that we issue licenses
 
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
but licenses in the agency as well as
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
manage investigations and disciplinary
 
00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.669 align:start position:0%
manage investigations and disciplinary
proceedings

00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
intent of the amendment was to do that
 
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
so I think the the purpose of the
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
amendment is to get house this part of
 
00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:30.020 align:start position:0%
the the codification of oplc under 310
 
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:34.820 align:start position:0%
and to allow them to
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
go on with that and leave the rest of it
 
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 so that and that gives
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
us more time really because we just got
 
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 Thursday gives us more time
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
to look at those elements in it that are
 
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
more complicated and that overlap with
 
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
existing statutes so that was the
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
purpose for the house bill 655 Amendment
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
Nikki if I may represent him just add
 
00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
one more Point
 
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the licensing uh
 
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
process that's proposed in this amended
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
version of 655
 
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
it's consistent with what the large
 
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
majority of our boards already do and
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
that the large majority of our boards
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
have already delegated the authority to
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
us to Asia licenses unless there are
 
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
obviously questions regarding criminal
 
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
history checks which would still be
 
00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:25.400 align:start position:0%
reviewed under this proposed structure
 
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
only a handful of boards still review
 
00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
applications on a very regular basis
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
most boards have delegated that to us
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
because they recognize one that it
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
largely is just an administrative
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
function to make sure that all criteria
 
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
is satisfied because it's objective and
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
then two there are serious Workforce
 
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
challenges with having to wait every 30
 
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
60 90 days to review and possibly issue
 
00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:51.539 align:start position:0%
licenses so it's consistent with what we
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
are doing but there have been concerns
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
raised by the LBA in audits performance
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
audits as to whether or not boards have
 
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
the authority to delegate that Authority
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
so this way this would essentially clear
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
up that question
 
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.310 align:start position:0%
up that question
foreign

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
I think that's very helpful to have this
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
dissociation as discussed early on that
 
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
you've already thought through this to a
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
considerable degree I think that's very
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
helpful for us to have confidence that
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
we're not getting from here to
 
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
Manchester by way of Los Angeles okay
 
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
I'll be very brief uh shengue attorney
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
with the office of professional
 
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification I'm here on
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Dental Board the board of
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
land surveyors the Board of Professional
 
00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:53.659 align:start position:0%
Engineers and the board of accountancy
 
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
the board of accountancy has a written
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:14.870 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
I believe the board of accountancies
 
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
written testimony speaks for itself uh
 
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
to the best of my ability I'll answer
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
questions as it relates to that as far
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
as the land surveyors and the
 
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers uh they did meet
 
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
yesterday and wanted to put on the
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
record that they are in opposition to
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
655 full stop that was the vote that
 
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
they gave me to represent to this
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
committee today as it relates to the
 
00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:42.299 align:start position:0%
Dental Board they had a few specific
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
concerns again this is notwithstanding
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment because they were not
 
00:29:48.889 --> 00:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
aware of that that may or may not change
 
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
their opinion as it relates to that I
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
couldn't make any representations as it
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
relates to that here today but
 
00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:56.820 align:start position:0%
specifically as it regards the Dental
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
Board they did have concerns with the
 
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
complaint process and procedure and the
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
vetting of the complaints having the
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
complaints come into oplc and having
 
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
them conduct the investigation without
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
any input from the board was problematic
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
for them they view their own
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
professional expertise and ability to
 
00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
view those complaints of prime
 
00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:22.460 align:start position:0%
importance and utilizing those expertise
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
they are aware that oplc does have the
 
00:30:27.769 --> 00:30:27.779 align:start position:0%
authority to contract with necessary
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
experts but that was their input as it
 
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
related to that specific concern the
 
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
other concern when reviewing the 655
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
that was currently constructed prior to
 
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment was that there was no
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
consideration as to what constitute
 
00:30:45.769 --> 00:30:45.779 align:start position:0%
professional misconduct as it related to
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
their specific profession so what if
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
anything they were to utilize so that
 
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
was a concern that they noted that also
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
applies to their reciprocal discipline
 
00:30:58.490 --> 00:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
because that was in the same repeal
 
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
again that is not concerned given the
 
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:03.539 align:start position:0%
fact that there's an amendment here
 
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
today but they wanted to put that on the
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
record they also had some concerns that
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
it related to reciprocity and the
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
issuances of licenses as many states
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
they highlight it's specifically Vermont
 
00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
have different standards so they were
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about an individual's ability
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
or a license ability to go to the
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
easiest State and then similarly be
 
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
situated within this state now I know
 
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
there's specific language that has been
 
00:31:33.529 --> 00:31:33.539 align:start position:0%
authorized about similarly situated in
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
good standing but they did have concerns
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
with the definition of what does
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction mean does that mean you
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
know within the United States
 
00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
Continental are we talking about
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
territories are we talking about
 
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction globally so that was some
 
00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
of their concerns open for questions if
 
00:31:54.049 --> 00:31:54.059 align:start position:0%
you have any thank you okay and so that
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
you're going to be here on Friday to
 
00:31:58.730 --> 00:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
address that I will okay perfect yes Dr
 
00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:02.510 align:start position:0%
address that I will okay perfect yes Dr
Warner

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.850 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:05.930 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
while she's coming up questioning the
 
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
chair uh Journey passed out some
 
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
information I have it right here and are
 
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
we all supposed to get that yes but I
 
00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:18.059 align:start position:0%
was going to wait until I was going to
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
wait till after if that's okay if it has
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
to do with I'm fine with that you're
 
00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:24.419 align:start position:0%
you're in control of the situation yeah
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I've had a chance to
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
look at the format that you have for the
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm looking at page five
 
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
um line 31 where it's talking about rule
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
making Authority uh where the oplc would
 
00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:54.299 align:start position:0%
be promulgating rules with the advice
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
and recommendations of the
 
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
representative board I would strongly
 
00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:00.620 align:start position:0%
suggest that you insert the words
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
with the active collaboration and the
 
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
advice okay you're on page five
 
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry page five the bottom of the
 
00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.210 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry page five the bottom of the
page

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:11.220 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
line 31
 
00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:19.019 align:start position:0%
all fees set forth yes all fees set
 
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
forth and RSA 310 colon 5 with the
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
advice and recommendations of the
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
respective board I would highly
 
00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:30.620 align:start position:0%
recommend inserting the words with the
 
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
after 310 colon 5 with the active
 
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
collaboration and advice and
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the board the reason
 
00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
for that is this is more passive and as
 
00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
it is right now the boards may get a
 
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
notice about rule changes with a couple
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
of days 300
 
00:33:57.529 --> 00:33:57.539 align:start position:0%
rules and such with a couple of days at
 
00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
the same time that they're preparing for
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
a board meeting but if there's active
 
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:03.419 align:start position:0%
collaboration then
 
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
they would have a chance to go review
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
with an oplc rule-making person what the
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
changes are and if they have any advice
 
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:14.599 align:start position:0%
and recommendations for that
 
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
as it's written it's somewhat passive
 
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
that they need to just simply be asked
 
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
okay we'll take that into consideration
 
00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:22.619 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll take it into
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you very much
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like this time for this time
 
00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:30.839 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee which is representative
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
Dolan myself and representative
 
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick to talk about the amendment
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
and whether or not we want to recommend
 
00:34:39.609 --> 00:34:39.619 align:start position:0%
it to the committee
 
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
I can say to you that representative
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
McGuire and I have been working on this
 
00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:46.250 align:start position:0%
McGuire and I have been working on this
together

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
because we felt that house bill 655
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
because it's an entirety was also
 
00:34:56.089 --> 00:34:56.099 align:start position:0%
in-house bill 2.
 
00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
we wanted to pull out the nuts and bolts
 
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
of oplc
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
and take that out of House Bill 2 and
 
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
deal with it with this amended form of
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 655
 
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
and then Friday the committee will get
 
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
together as a whole to discuss the
 
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh remaining part of House Bill 655
 
00:35:23.089 --> 00:35:23.099 align:start position:0%
that's still in-house Bill too is that
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to make this as easily
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
understood as possible if you have any
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
questions no thank you for your for your
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
work on it and it seems like a
 
00:35:34.569 --> 00:35:34.579 align:start position:0%
reasonable approach
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
yeah I've had requests
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
some spoke some folks who testified
 
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
today that that this is uh something
 
00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
that we ought to retain I don't want to
 
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
retain it we're not going to retain it
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
sorry at least I'm not going to
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
recommend that we retain it if you want
 
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
to make that motion
 
00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:55.079 align:start position:0%
I will
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
vote against that motion
 
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
don't want to retain or do one or
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
anything because it's in if we if we
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
retain this it will stay in House Bill
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
too so we're going to look at it one way
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
or the other
 
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.010 align:start position:0%
or the other
right

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
so by splitting it out
 
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
and pull it apart right this is the more
 
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
the part that's difficult and the part
 
00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
that we've heard from a lot of people
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
has to do with the repeals of the boards
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
and their authorities
 
00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
and that part has all been left in house
 
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
bill 2.
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
and we will deal with that starting
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
Friday well we're dealing with it as we
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
go along but we'll have a full committee
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
we'll have a full work committee meeting
 
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
on Friday about all those elements of it
 
00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:48.020 align:start position:0%
so the path is to amend it
 
00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.670 align:start position:0%
so the path is to amend it
exactly

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
the path is to approve this amendment
 
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.210 align:start position:0%
the path is to approve this amendment
no

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
um what question of the chair so the the
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
I think all of us that uh been
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
confronted with this situation on very
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
short notice and some of this is
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
extremely fundamental this is kind of
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
like ripping something out by the roots
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
uh and thinking that somehow you can
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
kind of Pat it on top of the ground and
 
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
make it go that that's troubling uh but
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
also the this involves a lot of
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and the and the the
 
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
well-being and the the benefit of the
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and and to the degree that they are
 
00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:40.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the bill or the
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm talking about the whole
 
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
situation because first of all we had
 
00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:50.660 align:start position:0%
655 came in came in and it was very
 
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
voluminous uh and then suddenly uh we
 
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
were confronted by the fact that the
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
governor had put the all this repeal in
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
um and that we all know that has to pass
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
so the contents of the trailer Bill uh
 
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
are extremely troubling to me if we
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
don't get the Public's input for the
 
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
benefits excuse me representative
 
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
Schmidt we are talking about the
 
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
amendment that we have here we're not
 
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
talking about House Bill 2. we're going
 
00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
to talk about you can talk about health
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
Bill too but not right now I don't want
 
00:38:29.329 --> 00:38:29.339 align:start position:0%
to talk about House Bill 2 what I want
 
00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
to talk about is the the fact that we
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
have some of the important members of
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
the public here right now and the
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
question is are we in any way
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
short-circuiting this process because
 
00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
it's so rushed
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
and we have so little time to do this
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
that to the degree that the public has
 
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
concerns that we will never hear because
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
the process is so what what concerns and
 
00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
House Bill and this amendment does the
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
what concerns do you have this is
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
codifying what they're doing now
 
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
that that it sounds good
 
00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that we don't
 
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
skip stuff where the public will not be
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
able to participate and will not know
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
and that we won't have time to really
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
fully this is the second cup
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting and we had a
 
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.370 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting and we had a
hearing

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
did we not we did have a hearing you're
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
talking you're not talking about the
 
00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:25.619 align:start position:0%
work session you're talking about the
 
00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
original hearing we had a hearing we had
 
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
we had enough committee meeting that you
 
00:39:32.329 --> 00:39:32.339 align:start position:0%
didn't attend in February we had a work
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
session on this and now we have another
 
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing
 
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm only making sure making sure
 
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
that my voice is heard with regard to
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
the having a thorough process where the
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
we and the public can really see what's
 
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
going on and have time to adjust this uh
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
and I I think the fact that you and the
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
chair have brought forward an amendment
 
00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
that seems to resolve some of the
 
00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
initial concerns we have I'm very glad
 
00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
to hear about that the uh but the
 
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
concern I have is that the public who
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
are the practitioners in many cases and
 
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
their boards that they have an
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to also be a full partner in
 
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
this redo of some very important
 
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
statutes uh and and I think I see what's
 
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
going in a good direction so I'm glad to
 
00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
hear that the Friday meeting is going to
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
take this up again I just want to make
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
sure we don't get you know kind of the
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
bums Rush here okay let's remember the
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 is in the is in Finance
 
00:40:40.609 --> 00:40:40.619 align:start position:0%
okay so we are not going to
 
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
we have really the only thing that we
 
00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
can do is make recommendations I
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
understand I understand the difficulty
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
of the process I just want to make sure
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
that we at least are looking at it and
 
00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
that we recognize that we're doing a lot
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
of important things Even in our
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
committee yeah so I I think I I'm
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
hearing a good process beginning I just
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%

foreign
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
good morning welcome to Edna
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'm opening the public hearing on
 
01:02:06.049 --> 01:02:06.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 84 and I call the sponsor
 
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
good morning executive departments and
 
01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
administration committee thank you so
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to introduce HB 84. this
 
01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
bill adds language to RSA 21-p colon 37
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
which I've given everyone a copy of
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
and it directs the director of Homeland
 
01:02:49.609 --> 01:02:49.619 align:start position:0%
Security Emergency Management
 
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
to assemble and mobilize a municipal
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
Emergency Response Team in conjunction
 
01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Transportation in
 
01:02:59.809 --> 01:02:59.819 align:start position:0%
order to assist municipalities that have
 
01:03:03.289 --> 01:03:03.299 align:start position:0%
been impacted by a natural disaster
 
01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:06.140 align:start position:0%
this Municipal Emergency Response Team
 
01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:09.299 align:start position:0%
would be comprised of existing staff
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
that could be mobilized in an instant to
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
respond to a natural disaster in one or
 
01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
more municipalities in the state
 
01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:20.420 align:start position:0%
it's much like when a business has
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
employees located on each floor of their
 
01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
company to be floor wardens or fire
 
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
wardens that could jump into action if
 
01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
an emergency occurs at work
 
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
a municipal Emergency Response Team
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
would contact the town or vice versa and
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
be ready to help provide any necessary
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
resources that the town may not have at
 
01:03:42.359 --> 01:03:43.609 align:start position:0%
resources that the town may not have at
hand

01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
they could draw from State resources
 
01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:51.260 align:start position:0%
things like trucks sand gravel signs Etc
 
01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
and deliver them quickly to where they
 
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
are needed
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
these designated individuals would also
 
01:03:59.569 --> 01:03:59.579 align:start position:0%
be able to go where the disaster
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
occurred to immediately view the damage
 
01:04:04.849 --> 01:04:04.859 align:start position:0%
and help with whatever the town needs if
 
01:04:04.859 --> 01:04:06.589 align:start position:0%
and help with whatever the town needs if
necessary

01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
and then quickly report back to the
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
governor so the emergency declaration
 
01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
process for FEMA can get started
 
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
this idea came to me after what happened
 
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
in the July 2021 floods in Acworth the
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
town that one of the towns that I
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
represent and the surrounding towns
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
my town was struggling with trying to
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
locate items like sandbags signage
 
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
Gravel Road barriers trucks Emergency
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
Equipment and all other resources to
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
deal with the aftermath of this natural
 
01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
disaster to make roadways passable and
 
01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
safe especially for emergency vehicles
 
01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
it took us days
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
even weeks to locate resources that we
 
01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.870 align:start position:0%
even weeks to locate resources that we
needed

01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
we spent precious time trying to figure
 
01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
out where to get assistance and who
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
might be able to help us acquire the
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
temporary resources that we needed
 
01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:03.299 align:start position:0%
and although we were in touch with then
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
director Jennifer Harper of Homeland
 
01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
Security emergency management the
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
response time and help from that office
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
was painfully slow
 
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
now I do know that there is a municipal
 
01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
Mutual Aid Society but a town must be a
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
dues-paying member and they do not
 
01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
always have the Emergency Equipment and
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
resources that you might be seeking in
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
fact there were pretty much of no use to
 
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
our town after the floods hit
 
01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
we called them and they didn't have the
 
01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
items we were seeking specifically Road
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
barriers and signs surrounding towns had
 
01:05:39.289 --> 01:05:39.299 align:start position:0%
similar problems we were having in
 
01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
dealing with their flooding and their
 
01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
resources were being used for their own
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
emergencies so they couldn't lend them
 
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:47.579 align:start position:0%
out to us
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
we did after a while get some great help
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
from dot director of operations David
 
01:05:55.609 --> 01:05:55.619 align:start position:0%
rodrigue but that was after much
 
01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
searching for contact information the
 
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
dot was very helpful to us in the end
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
but we had wished we had gotten them on
 
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
board to our needs much sooner
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
they're also very helpful in assisting
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
with notifications for road closures
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
yes every town should have a checklist
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
of what to do in an emergency as well as
 
01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
numbers for who to call
 
01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
Acworth as well as other towns has an
 
01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
emergency plan and we found difficulty
 
01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
when actually implementing it because
 
01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:27.059 align:start position:0%
these lists can get out of date quickly
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
people change jobs phone numbers change
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
and some situations you just cannot plan
 
01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.549 align:start position:0%
and some situations you just cannot plan
for

01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:36.299 align:start position:0%
it would have been better to have state
 
01:06:39.049 --> 01:06:39.059 align:start position:0%
resources to help immediately and at the
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
ready when we needed it and when things
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
are in such a tumult where whole roads
 
01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
have washed away and infrastructure is
 
01:06:49.849 --> 01:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
totally destroyed smaller towns with
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
part-time help and small road
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
maintenance crews could really use some
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
immediate help from the state
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
and that is what this changed to statute
 
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
seeks to fix
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
so I hope that you will consider this a
 
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
worthwhile addition to the state statute
 
01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
that could truly be helpful when the
 
01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
disaster strikes especially to our
 
01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
smaller rural towns and with that I'd be
 
01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions or go over
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
which actually adds a new paragraph to
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
uh the statute which I handed out to you
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
this morning thank you thank you are
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative leckis
 
01:07:33.529 --> 01:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
thank you uh just wondering so for
 
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
um it's 21 P 37 to go into effect does
 
01:07:38.089 --> 01:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
that require that the governors declared
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency or does this take
 
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
effect in other circumstances no what
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
this does is that
 
01:07:50.089 --> 01:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
um the it would it would say that the
 
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
the Department of Homeland emergency
 
01:07:53.819 --> 01:07:54.849 align:start position:0%
the Department of Homeland emergency
um

01:07:54.849 --> 01:07:54.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:56.569 --> 01:07:56.579 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security and Emergency
 
01:07:59.329 --> 01:07:59.339 align:start position:0%
Management work in cooperation with
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
other departments such as the Department
 
01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:03.299 align:start position:0%
of Transportation to name some
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
individuals who would be on an on a
 
01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
emergency response team and that if a
 
01:08:13.849 --> 01:08:13.859 align:start position:0%
natural disaster strikes a flooding or
 
01:08:15.289 --> 01:08:15.299 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
a tornado fire explosion whatever that
 
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
that team could be put into a action
 
01:08:25.249 --> 01:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
right away to either contact the town or
 
01:08:28.249 --> 01:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
have the town contact them so that there
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
would be resources made available
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
immediately to the municipality
 
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
representative Rhoda and then I bear
 
01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
understanding the the necessity for this
 
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.209 align:start position:0%
understanding the the necessity for this
bill

01:08:47.209 --> 01:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
as it relates to what was currently
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
being done because I would think that
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
if a tone
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
were to need assistance from
 
01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
other departments
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
under a natural disaster it's not like
 
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
something you know
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
I mean a natural disaster is a big deal
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
people know what those that those exist
 
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
and that's the purpose of Homeland
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
Security and the the Departments that
 
01:09:17.209 --> 01:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
you refer to I just don't know why this
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
is needed
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
can you explain that please well I mean
 
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
just judging from what happened in my
 
01:09:26.329 --> 01:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
own town there was really no coordinated
 
01:09:26.339 --> 01:09:27.470 align:start position:0%
own town there was really no coordinated
effort

01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
effort
 
01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:31.259 align:start position:0%
put in place on the onset of of this
 
01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
natural disaster and we were really
 
01:09:35.809 --> 01:09:35.819 align:start position:0%
scrambling for days and even like I said
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
in in two weeks to uh get the resources
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
that we needed that we didn't have on
 
01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.030 align:start position:0%
that we needed that we didn't have on
hand

01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:47.060 align:start position:0%
for our town to be able to deal with
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
such Devastation in roads being washed
 
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
away completely and damaged to a point
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
of Disappearing so my point is that this
 
01:10:03.610 --> 01:10:03.620 align:start position:0%
would have a team assembled already
 
01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
would be able to draw upon
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
and would be there to help a town
 
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
you know having to scramble around for
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
days and weeks to get the help that we
 
01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.010 align:start position:0%
days and weeks to get the help that we
needed

01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
the next speaker is from Dot and may be
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
able to explain the differences because
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
I think that is an important issue other
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
questions specifically for
 
01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron representative
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
O'Brien uh thank you madam chair uh
 
01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
01:10:34.739 --> 01:10:36.010 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
question

01:10:36.010 --> 01:10:36.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh can you tell us about your town and
 
01:10:43.729 --> 01:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
in context of an emergency disasters
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
they're all one it doesn't really matter
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
thank you I mean a blizzard can be a
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
complication okay yeah when it does
 
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
occur but
 
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
does your Town require people to go to
 
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
additional schoolings for the incident
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
command system and do the different type
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
of networking and you know to learn some
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
of these things or do you rely heavily
 
01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
on the state to send you in the right
 
01:11:08.219 --> 01:11:09.830 align:start position:0%
on the state to send you in the right
direction

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question first of all
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
my town of Acworth is a town of 850
 
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.250 align:start position:0%
my town of Acworth is a town of 850
people

01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
we have a road crew of three
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
we have 55 miles of road that we
 
01:11:24.610 --> 01:11:24.620 align:start position:0%
maintain with that road crew of three
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't rely on the state if
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
we don't have to
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
certainly but in this particular
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
instance when we had this this
 
01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
absolutely devastating flooding in July
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
2021 where entire roads were gone
 
01:11:42.239 --> 01:11:43.729 align:start position:0%
2021 where entire roads were gone
overnight

01:11:43.729 --> 01:11:43.739 align:start position:0%
overnight
 
01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:46.940 align:start position:0%
we did not have the resources or
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
manpower to deal with that on our own
 
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.010 align:start position:0%
manpower to deal with that on our own
and

01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
it yes we have people in our town who
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
are trained in Emergency Management we
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
have uh you know our our volunteer
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
firemen we have our EMTs all of that
 
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
people who are trained but when you
 
01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources of uh Road
 
01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
signage to keep people from driving off
 
01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:14.219 align:start position:0%
the side of the road and you don't have
 
01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know the gravel or uh the um
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
sandbags and that kind of thing
 
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
available to you as a small town the
 
01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
only place to turn to would either be
 
01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
through a mutual Aid Society which we do
 
01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
have access to but they were busy with
 
01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:33.380 align:start position:0%
their own issues of flooding
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
or the state and it took us a while
 
01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
before we can get in touch with the
 
01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
state to get the resources that we
 
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
needed in place
 
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
so it my idea is that if they had an
 
01:12:51.169 --> 01:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
emergency response team in place that
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
they could come to us right away it
 
01:12:58.970 --> 01:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.169 --> 01:13:00.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative a bear or is that for
 
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:09.970 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:09.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um representative
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
I looked up while you were speaking and
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
the state has had a division of
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services since 1999.
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned I believe a contact
 
01:13:30.169 --> 01:13:30.179 align:start position:0%
that I understood was in homeland
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
security but did your town contact
 
01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
emergency services which I has been
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
aligned with my town for many years
 
01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
do you know if they contacted I'm sure
 
01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
they contacted whoever they needed to
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
contact and it was
 
01:13:50.689 --> 01:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
we had very big difficulty in getting
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
people to come to help us and get the
 
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
resources that we needed
 
01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
interested to hear from the dot
 
01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
gentleman to see what could what could
 
01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
we thank you thank you anyone else all
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much representative
 
01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
thank you David Rodrigo
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.910 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee
 
01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is David
 
01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
rodrigue I am the assistant commissioner
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire Department of
 
01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.110 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire Department of
Transportation

01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
um I want to start by just explaining
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
that this this particular storm was very
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
devastating particularly to the town of
 
01:14:40.679 --> 01:14:42.229 align:start position:0%
devastating particularly to the town of
Acworth

01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
Acworth
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
um I've been responding to these uh
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
events for for more than 15 years and I
 
01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:53.060 align:start position:0%
have never seen an individual Community
 
01:14:56.930 --> 01:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
suffer so much damage and it probably
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
goes back to the Alstead floods since
 
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
we've seen a community that suffered so
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
much damage and I apologize to the
 
01:15:12.169 --> 01:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
representative that it took longer than
 
01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:15.780 align:start position:0%
than it should have for her to feel that
 
01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:18.380 align:start position:0%
the town had the attention
 
01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
of the the state of New Hampshire
 
01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
um I want to start by just walking
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
through when events like this this occur
 
01:15:32.209 --> 01:15:32.219 align:start position:0%
um they often come on very very quickly
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
and in a matter of four to six hours
 
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
sometimes a little more sometimes uh a
 
01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
little less parts of our stay can be
 
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
devastated roads roads are washed out
 
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
bridges are washed out emergency
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
services are struggling to find out how
 
01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
they can get to people's homes to to
 
01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
help them
 
01:16:00.169 --> 01:16:00.179 align:start position:0%
um to make sure people are safe I can
 
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
tell you from a DOT perspective we
 
01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
become hyper focused on responding to to
 
01:16:12.490 --> 01:16:12.500 align:start position:0%
those events that that hyper Focus
 
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
becomes on our state roads doing our own
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
assessments and doing our own response
 
01:16:25.729 --> 01:16:25.739 align:start position:0%
at the same time often the the Emergency
 
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
Operations Center is activated by the
 
01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
division of Homeland Security and
 
01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management
 
01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
dot that they they followed the incident
 
01:16:40.669 --> 01:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
command structure and they they have set
 
01:16:44.649 --> 01:16:44.659 align:start position:0%
up several emergency support functions
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
dot sits at the Emergency Operations
 
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
Center and fills two of those emergency
 
01:16:54.649 --> 01:16:54.659 align:start position:0%
support functions one is for
 
01:16:56.930 --> 01:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
transportation and one is for public
 
01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
works and in engineering this type of of
 
01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
damage falls under Public Works and in
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
engineering there is a robust process in
 
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
in place for communities through their
 
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
their Emergency Management directors to
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
reach out to Homeland Security through
 
01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
local Liaisons and during calls that are
 
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
often scheduled to ask for resources
 
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
that they need and at that point our
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
folks who are at the Emergency
 
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
Operations Center work to match
 
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
communities up with with the resources
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
that they need I can tell you for a town
 
01:17:44.209 --> 01:17:44.219 align:start position:0%
like Acworth in the damage that they
 
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
they suffered three days four days it's
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's harrowing one week two weeks it's
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
harrowing to fully comprehend what's
 
01:17:58.729 --> 01:17:58.739 align:start position:0%
happened to your community and how how
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
to to go forward
 
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
we have worked with the public works
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
Community for for many years to
 
01:18:09.169 --> 01:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
establish what we call Public Works
 
01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
Mutual Aid and the idea of Public Works
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
Mutual Aid is just like a fire
 
01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
department when they face a a fire that
 
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
is beyond their local capabilities they
 
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
call on neighboring towns to help them
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
Public Works Mutual Aid is supposed to
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
work very much the the same way
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
um not all communities are members of
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
Public Works Mutual Aid the cost to be a
 
01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
member is 25 to to join
 
01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:42.659 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure if that's a
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
recurring annual fee or not but it's
 
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
it's 25 information is available for
 
01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
that from t-squared technology
 
01:18:57.410 --> 01:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
um group at UNH works with with Public
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
Works communities and also the New
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association that
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
that group is not as mature as we would
 
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
like to see it and and
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
um representative Aaron is right on that
 
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
that group has a very difficult time
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
responding immediately with with
 
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
supplies and resources to to help
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
um I want to tell you unfortunately the
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
D.O.T has a hard time responding as as
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
much as as well as we would like I for
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
years have worked with others at D.O.T
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
and others have have tried to get a
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
small group in our design team or our
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
our Highway design Bureau to help us
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
with with uh state roads and quick
 
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
response just a little bit of the the
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
numbers of people that we're talking
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
about Statewide that that would be able
 
01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
to help with this and we were looking
 
01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
right now the department overall
 
01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
typically has 156 civil engineers that's
 
01:20:14.689 --> 01:20:14.699 align:start position:0%
in Concord and Statewide
 
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry we we typically have a
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
little over 200 currently we have 156 we
 
01:20:26.649 --> 01:20:26.659 align:start position:0%
have 43 vacancy rates or 43 vacancies
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
and that's over uh 22 vacancy rate
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
and in our Highway design Bureau we
 
01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
typically have 60 or we currently have
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
61 people we have 25 vacancies or a
 
01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate of 30 percent
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
for our winter maintenance people who
 
01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
are out there right now who are the
 
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
crews that are distributed around the
 
01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
state that drive the trucks in and the
 
01:20:57.530 --> 01:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
the equipment
 
01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:58.310 align:start position:0%
the equipment
um

01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
currently we have 175 vacancies or just
 
01:21:06.010 --> 01:21:06.020 align:start position:0%
over 25 percent
 
01:21:10.610 --> 01:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
well I agree 100 with what
 
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative is Aaron Aaron is asking
 
01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
for in this bill I fear that we would be
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
making a promise that we are not staffed
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
to to keep even when we're we're fully
 
01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:26.699 align:start position:0%
staffed we those people become fully
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
engaged in our own roads
 
01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
123a flows through Acworth and just
 
01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
south of Acworth and Alstead from this
 
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
very same storm that road is currently
 
01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
alternating one-way traffic
 
01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
awaiting a project to be designed and
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully funded by by FEMA to restore
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
that to two-way traffic the the truth of
 
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
the matter is that it does take us us
 
01:21:59.630 --> 01:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
time to respond and we do so to to the
 
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
best of of our ability
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
I do think that there are current laws
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
that allow some of what representative
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
Aaron is asking for to happen to to
 
01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:14.630 align:start position:0%
Aaron is asking for to happen to to
happen

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
um I also want to point out that as we
 
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
respond to emergencies in these very
 
01:22:22.330 --> 01:22:22.340 align:start position:0%
same areas
 
01:22:27.169 --> 01:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
we rely very heavily on contractors and
 
01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
we rely very heavily on local businesses
 
01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
local gravel pits for for sand and and
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
so forth and and those things
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
um what I would really ask for and we
 
01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
should probably find a way to provide it
 
01:22:48.189 --> 01:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
on our own is to work better to together
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
to strengthen Public Works Mutual Aid
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
and to strengthen our process to make
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
sure as as these events uh occur
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
um the Emergency Management directors
 
01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:05.699 align:start position:0%
are connected with Homeland Security and
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
we're getting the the request for for
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
resources and able to respond but I just
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
want to to add no matter how good of a
 
01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
job we do
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
um 48 Hours three days after a store it
 
01:23:26.570 --> 01:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
takes time for us to to figure out the
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
full extent of
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
um the damage that we suffered during
 
01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
these events and I'd take any questions
 
01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much I just
 
01:23:39.050 --> 01:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
want to confirm that you're saying you
 
01:23:41.209 --> 01:23:41.219 align:start position:0%
think you have the
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
basic structure to respond to an
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
emergency although probably not as fast
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
as some people might like but you're
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
currently understaffed and when an
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
emergency hits you're stretched in that
 
01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:54.229 align:start position:0%
emergency hits you're stretched in that
area

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:23:56.450 --> 01:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
I think the structure through Homeland
 
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
Security and and Emergency Management is
 
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
excellent I think the Emergency
 
01:24:06.169 --> 01:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
Operations Center works very well we
 
01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
have dot representatives in there that
 
01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
can help work with communities to to
 
01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
find resources but yes it takes longer
 
01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:20.219 align:start position:0%
than than communities would like during
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
those times absolutely okay
 
01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
representative schuett and then Schmidt
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
and a bear and O'Brien
 
01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
um Mr rodrigue I'm curious
 
01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
um has your department done any kind of
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
Outreach to try and expand this Public
 
01:24:43.970 --> 01:24:43.980 align:start position:0%
Works Mutual Aid id idea
 
01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
we have we there there is a a public
 
01:24:50.930 --> 01:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
works Association that the department is
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
a part of there's also the board of
 
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
directors for that Association that the
 
01:24:59.450 --> 01:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
department is a part of we work very
 
01:25:02.450 --> 01:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
closely with court bloomquest from the
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
city of Keene who kind of of lead leads
 
01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
that group but the the truth is at the
 
01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
end of the day what public works and
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
highways communities and
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
communities fund us oftentimes not an
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
acworth's case but communities
 
01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
oftentimes resource us just that are a
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
little lower than other priorities in
 
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
their communities
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
um and well from a fire perspective we
 
01:25:39.290 --> 01:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
think nothing about jumping in to
 
01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
respond when the when these types of
 
01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
events happen if if if a road agent
 
01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
wants to respond they need the support
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
of their local officials the questions
 
01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
of are we really going to get reimbursed
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
if we send people over there come into
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
play the questions of are we really
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
going to get our pipe back if we send
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
that over come into to to play this
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
should be no questions of that and we
 
01:26:11.209 --> 01:26:11.219 align:start position:0%
need to do a better job working with the
 
01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
public works Association
 
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
um to help strengthen that that part of
 
01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
our response so it's just as clean as it
 
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.689 align:start position:0%
 
Schmidt

01:26:26.689 --> 01:26:26.699 align:start position:0%
Schmidt
 
01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
um so uh this is also obvious that it's
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
kind of like you know if it's icy
 
01:26:38.689 --> 01:26:38.699 align:start position:0%
outside don't go outside because you
 
01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
might fall if you fall you got a problem
 
01:26:46.129 --> 01:26:46.139 align:start position:0%
uh but the question is for us is what
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
does this bill do that is not already
 
01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
Common Sense the governor has
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
extraordinary Authority as you know in
 
01:26:55.850 --> 01:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
emergencies to do whatever is necessary
 
01:26:59.450 --> 01:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
the question is how quickly can you can
 
01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
he or she respond with the apparatus
 
01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
that we have which is what you've been
 
01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
talking about what does this bill do
 
01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
that that is not just words on paper
 
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
that will not be implemented any better
 
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
than what we currently have
 
01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:16.450 align:start position:0%
than what we currently have
foreign

01:27:16.450 --> 01:27:16.460 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
this bill may put requirements on the
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
DLT that we can't physically meet and
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
they said it an expectation that that we
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
have resources
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
um that we don't necessarily have that
 
01:27:34.129 --> 01:27:34.139 align:start position:0%
that being said the the fact that we're
 
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
talking about this bill is is a clear
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
indication to me as has been suggested
 
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
that we can work better with the
 
01:27:46.729 --> 01:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
communities to be more prepared so
 
01:27:49.729 --> 01:27:49.739 align:start position:0%
um part of what's listed in this bill is
 
01:27:53.709 --> 01:27:53.719 align:start position:0%
is signs and traffic controlled devices
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
we again we become stressed in these
 
01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
times without having signs and traffic
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
control devices we we go pretty far to
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
to get those we will provide them to to
 
01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
a community if we have them and as the
 
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
requests come through the EOC but maybe
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
there are some things we could do if we
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
had some funding to put together some
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
trailers with device with some devices
 
01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
that could be available to go to
 
01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
communities when they need them so there
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
is some more proactive work we could do
 
01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
if we had the the funding to to do that
 
01:28:36.169 --> 01:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
I I understand the reality is it's it's
 
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
kind of like you know if you've got
 
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
triplets then Mom and Dad are going to
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
have to triage right if you all three of
 
01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
them need something simultaneously you
 
01:28:47.689 --> 01:28:47.699 align:start position:0%
don't have enough hands you're always
 
01:28:50.209 --> 01:28:50.219 align:start position:0%
going to need one more shovel one more
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
fire truck one more if you have a real
 
01:28:56.209 --> 01:28:56.219 align:start position:0%
emergency so what does this bill do that
 
01:28:58.610 --> 01:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
you can't already do if you just had
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
more people
 
01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
because you're never going to have
 
01:29:04.729 --> 01:29:04.739 align:start position:0%
enough people for every imaginable
 
01:29:07.729 --> 01:29:07.739 align:start position:0%
emergency what does this bill do that we
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:18.530 --> 01:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
so what what this bill requires is that
 
01:29:21.649 --> 01:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
team be mobilized be ready to go and be
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
mobilized in the event of that that an
 
01:29:27.649 --> 01:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
emergency occurs we do not have that
 
01:29:31.129 --> 01:29:31.139 align:start position:0%
team available and ready to mobilize at
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
this point so that's what the bill would
 
01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:33.950 align:start position:0%
this point so that's what the bill would
do

01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
so what I'm hearing is that you need at
 
01:29:49.970 --> 01:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
your level and with mutual Aid and with
 
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
the DOT
 
01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
you guys need to be reinforced more than
 
01:29:58.129 --> 01:29:58.139 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do to your answers
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
to representative Schmidt
 
01:30:03.530 --> 01:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
yes this bill puts the burden and the
 
01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
requirement on the D.O.T with the
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
resources that we have
 
01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:12.300 align:start position:0%
um we would not be able to to meet the
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
requirement of this of this bill with
 
01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
the resources that we have without
 
01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
expense to responding to our own D.O.T
 
01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
um assets and without the expense of
 
01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
continuing the the work that we're doing
 
01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
on the projects that that we have in the
 
01:30:35.890 --> 01:30:35.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
so has your department reported to the
 
01:30:42.169 --> 01:30:42.179 align:start position:0%
state that you guys just need more more
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
expanded support or I've talked to your
 
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
team several times and I know that you
 
01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
you need four guys to close and exit so
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
if we have a fuel truck run down a hill
 
01:30:57.169 --> 01:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
spill fuel into the river I assume that
 
01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
you guys have access to the pads needed
 
01:31:01.850 --> 01:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
to throw into the river to absorb the
 
01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:02.930 align:start position:0%
to throw into the river to absorb the
fuel

01:31:02.930 --> 01:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
fuel
 
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
and to to triage there
 
01:31:08.090 --> 01:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
um but you're what you're saying is you
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
need more so I just don't to
 
01:31:13.490 --> 01:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt's points I don't
 
01:31:17.209 --> 01:31:17.219 align:start position:0%
see how this this bill fixes what the
 
01:31:19.490 --> 01:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
real root cause problem is unless you
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
can shed some light thank you right you
 
01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
you are correct this bill does not fix
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
that that root problem just do follow
 
01:31:31.129 --> 01:31:31.139 align:start position:0%
through with your emergency scenario if
 
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
if that happens that's the fire
 
01:31:36.890 --> 01:31:36.900 align:start position:0%
department that responds to do that type
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
of incident with the fuel spill and and
 
01:31:42.649 --> 01:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
would arrest that we may respond to help
 
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
with traffic control and we may respond
 
01:31:48.649 --> 01:31:48.659 align:start position:0%
to take care of anything within our own
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure or make sure that as part
 
01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
of the cleanup things are taken care of
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
within our own infrastructure but our
 
01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility doesn't extend beyond we
 
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
limit our responsibility to our roadway
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
Network him right away
 
01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative O'Brien was next
 
01:32:10.610 --> 01:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
if you still have a question thank you
 
01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
madam chair I might have a couple but
 
01:32:15.649 --> 01:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
I'll keep them focused please thank you
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh in the situation that
 
01:32:20.689 --> 01:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron has brought up you
 
01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
know and I understand there's a
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
difference between Rainbow City and the
 
01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
actual disaster it may take years to get
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
the road finally repaired but I think
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
what representative Aaron is really
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
where was the state representative like
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
in other words now just to give you the
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
usual caveats I was a deputy chief in
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
Nashua if I needed something do you
 
01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
think I'm going to call on the crane and
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
be on the phone for an hour trying to
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
get a crane if I needed a building to be
 
01:32:54.050 --> 01:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
torn down I delegated that Authority
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
through it against in the command system
 
01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
do you have that in other words will you
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
at least send a supervisor to look at
 
01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
the situation then say okay we can
 
01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
handle this we can handle that and be
 
01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
part of the command system and
 
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
furthermore this committee voted to make
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh Public Works First Responders
 
01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
so therefore I think you have that you
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
know ability to fall within the incident
 
01:33:24.050 --> 01:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
command system
 
01:33:27.410 --> 01:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
so yes so that's that's a a good
 
01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
question right so we we do that as I
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
explained we we've filled the desk at
 
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
the Emergency Operations Center and we
 
01:33:39.050 --> 01:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
take the request for resources as they
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
they come in as our supervisors we are
 
01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
focused on our state roadway Network in
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
responding to that and making sure that
 
01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
the bridges people drive over to to get
 
01:33:54.649 --> 01:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
to those locations can be used safely
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
they typical typically suffice suffer
 
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
damages as well and again we become
 
01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
focused on our own infrastructure first
 
01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I'll take that it just seems
 
01:34:12.530 --> 01:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
to be a gap within and if we're going to
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
include you as part of the First
 
01:34:17.209 --> 01:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
Responders then I think there needs to
 
01:34:20.090 --> 01:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
be better training along that type of
 
01:34:22.370 --> 01:34:22.380 align:start position:0%
lines in other words the fire chief
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
police chief or whoever is the IC
 
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
Incident Commander doesn't need to make
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
the phone calls he needs to delegate and
 
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
say to like dot you're handling this
 
01:34:35.689 --> 01:34:35.699 align:start position:0%
yeah you get a bridge in trouble we got
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
this we're going to block it off good I
 
01:34:39.709 --> 01:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
don't want to see you again until it's
 
01:34:42.050 --> 01:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
done you know and that's traditionally
 
01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
how it operates
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
and and that's a gap that we are hoping
 
01:34:50.570 --> 01:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
Public Works Mutual Aid will help fill
 
01:34:53.209 --> 01:34:53.219 align:start position:0%
so that's that's your communities you're
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
asking so you're not taking the D.O.T
 
01:34:59.090 --> 01:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
from Route 10 and with with so many
 
01:35:02.209 --> 01:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
vehicles per hour to a much lower volume
 
01:35:05.209 --> 01:35:05.219 align:start position:0%
of road to to take care of that problem
 
01:35:05.219 --> 01:35:06.169 align:start position:0%
of road to to take care of that problem
there

01:35:06.169 --> 01:35:06.179 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
the the perception is we got so many
 
01:35:11.689 --> 01:35:11.699 align:start position:0%
people you just take them from somewhere
 
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
else right so during this this same
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
storm that again devastated Acworth we
 
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
had damage and Gilmanton we had damage
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
in Loudon we had damage to Alton so the
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
perception that we can take people from
 
01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
other places can we app at Peril at
 
01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:35.270 align:start position:0%
other places can we app at Peril at
peril

01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
peril
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you for answering the
 
01:35:38.209 --> 01:35:38.219 align:start position:0%
questions and Madam chair I'm going to
 
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
end it at that I think when we get to
 
01:35:42.649 --> 01:35:42.659 align:start position:0%
Executive we could peel the banana on
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
this one all right thank you
 
01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:45.169 align:start position:0%
this one all right thank you
representative

01:35:45.169 --> 01:35:45.179 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
no okay representative leckis thank you
 
01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
um so my question is if you had more
 
01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:54.659 align:start position:0%
resources or maybe some resources
 
01:35:57.169 --> 01:35:57.179 align:start position:0%
dedicated to responding to the sort of
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
emergency as you described maybe
 
01:36:01.729 --> 01:36:01.739 align:start position:0%
trailers full of stuff or whatever
 
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
um is there
 
01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
you know would you respond better and in
 
01:36:08.169 --> 01:36:08.179 align:start position:0%
the way this bill wants do you have the
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
authority to do it and would you
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
actually do it is it completely a
 
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
resource issue or is there you know
 
01:36:17.930 --> 01:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
would this bill help if you had more
 
01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:20.350 align:start position:0%
would this bill help if you had more
resources

01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
our our belief my belief is that the
 
01:36:28.729 --> 01:36:28.739 align:start position:0%
emergency management system that we have
 
01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
in this day works and and works well the
 
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
homeland security with the Emergency
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
Operations Center and bringing us all to
 
01:36:41.330 --> 01:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
together works and works well my
 
01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:43.860 align:start position:0%
position is it is the Public Works
 
01:36:45.649 --> 01:36:45.659 align:start position:0%
Mutual Aid that we should be
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
strengthening and that all communities
 
01:36:51.649 --> 01:36:51.659 align:start position:0%
should be supporting to help fill this
 
01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
this Gap thank you okay thank you
 
01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:57.890 align:start position:0%
this Gap thank you okay thank you
representative

01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:59.930 --> 01:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:37:02.209 --> 01:37:02.219 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
um my assistant manager lived in Acworth
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
and it was horrible
 
01:37:08.450 --> 01:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the bill
 
01:37:11.689 --> 01:37:11.699 align:start position:0%
um my question to you is do you see more
 
01:37:13.970 --> 01:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
and more natural disasters happening
 
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
impacting our roads
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
as time goes by are you seeing more or
 
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
less we we we see more so there there's
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
no doubt that we have more intense
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
storms more frequently than than we have
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
historically we also have more developed
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
property and more infrastructure and
 
01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
more people pushed out into areas that
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
they haven't been in the past that they
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
need access to follow-up manager
 
01:37:42.239 --> 01:37:43.610 align:start position:0%
need access to follow-up manager
follow-up

01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:45.410 align:start position:0%
follow-up
so

01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing and I maybe I didn't
 
01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:49.139 align:start position:0%
hear you correctly is that there's
 
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
really not a system right now to
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
prioritize requests that come in oh
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:37:59.350 --> 01:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm so um
 
01:38:03.530 --> 01:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
that there is a a very robust system so
 
01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:06.679 align:start position:0%
again the Emergency Operations Center
 
01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
activates they they have a system web
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
EOC that that gets populated we respond
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
to to that location request come in from
 
01:38:24.410 --> 01:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
communities and there is a targeted
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
um response to make sure that those
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
those requests are satisfied as soon as
 
01:38:35.450 --> 01:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
as possible in this in this case what
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
we're hearing from from Acworth and
 
01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron is it wasn't enough
 
01:38:45.770 --> 01:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
they they needed boots on the ground to
 
01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
help when this storm unfolded the the at
 
01:38:53.689 --> 01:38:53.699 align:start position:0%
as it was unfolding I was in the field
 
01:38:57.649 --> 01:38:57.659 align:start position:0%
looking at state state assets and damage
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
to to State assets not not in in Acworth
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
but we were available to take the calls
 
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
and respond
 
01:39:11.209 --> 01:39:11.219 align:start position:0%
but it's difficult for the town to know
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what they need exactly where
 
01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
they need it and to come up with a plan
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
with something as as devastating as that
 
01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:23.159 align:start position:0%
so what I hear from Acworth is they
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
needed boots on the ground with them
 
01:39:28.990 --> 01:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
with their Emergency Management director
 
01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
helping to respond and the the solution
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's being presented is that should be
 
01:39:39.290 --> 01:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
the D.O.T that comes in and supports
 
01:39:42.290 --> 01:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
them on the ground at their at their
 
01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
location the current structure would
 
01:39:47.689 --> 01:39:47.699 align:start position:0%
support that would be Public Works
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
Mutual Aid which is a significantly
 
01:39:54.169 --> 01:39:54.179 align:start position:0%
larger pool Statewide that would fold
 
01:39:57.530 --> 01:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
that Gap and admittedly we have some
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
work to do to improve that process
 
01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gerhart thank
 
01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
you madam chair in the interest of time
 
01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
I'll just take a yes or no on this are
 
01:40:08.450 --> 01:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
there reports as to the actions that you
 
01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
did or didn't take for incidences that
 
01:40:13.250 --> 01:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
occurred such as this flood yes thank
 
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
you okay excellent any other questions
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
representative schuette
 
01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just just one more
 
01:40:26.209 --> 01:40:26.219 align:start position:0%
quick one I think uh would you say that
 
01:40:28.970 --> 01:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
the problems encountered in this
 
01:40:32.330 --> 01:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
incident have spurred your department to
 
01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
I I get I am very proud of our emergency
 
01:40:46.669 --> 01:40:46.679 align:start position:0%
response before and after this this
 
01:40:46.679 --> 01:40:48.470 align:start position:0%
response before and after this this
event

01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
event
 
01:40:50.930 --> 01:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
um so no I don't think it has caused us
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
to to respond more quickly I I think it
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
brings to light that if there is an
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
expectation that D.O.T is staffed to
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
send a purse even one person never mind
 
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
the team to each individual Community as
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
an emergency is unfolded or in the
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
immediate aftermath we are not resourced
 
01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
to do that and we do not and cannot
 
01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
provide that that service if if we can
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
can get there days later one or more of
 
01:41:27.610 --> 01:41:27.620 align:start position:0%
us become focused because it's not till
 
01:41:30.890 --> 01:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
oftentimes two or three days later that
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know exactly where the the damage is
 
01:41:37.490 --> 01:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
concentrated which communities are hard
 
01:41:40.729 --> 01:41:40.739 align:start position:0%
artist and and and need the work we can
 
01:41:42.890 --> 01:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
provide them a little level of support
 
01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
but again not that that team to to come
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
in ideally we would be leveraging just
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
as dot does and and our response we
 
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
leverage uh contractor Partners private
 
01:42:00.169 --> 01:42:00.179 align:start position:0%
contractor Partners that's why it's so
 
01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
important that we have our rented
 
01:42:04.669 --> 01:42:04.679 align:start position:0%
equipment program and work with
 
01:42:07.609 --> 01:42:07.619 align:start position:0%
contractors to rent their equipment and
 
01:42:10.370 --> 01:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
sometimes their people and equipment to
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
respond to to these things that's how
 
01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
we're able to do it more quickly not
 
01:42:18.189 --> 01:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
with our people
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
towns need engineers and other other
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
folks from the private sector to come in
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
and help as well to fill that Gap thank
 
01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:32.390 align:start position:0%
and help as well to fill that Gap thank
you

01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you is there
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to testify on
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 84
 
01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
all right seeing now I'm going to close
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
and since
 
01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
we are running late I will go into the
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 127. I do
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
expect to vote on that bill this
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon in our scheduled executive
 
01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.570 align:start position:0%
afternoon in our scheduled executive
session

01:43:01.570 --> 01:43:01.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm Tony luckis representing
 
01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
um Hillsborough District 38 the towns of
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
Hudson and Litchfield
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 127
 
01:43:22.970 --> 01:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
is identical to house bill 275.
 
01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:23.750 align:start position:0%
is identical to house bill 275.
um

01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
initially came in in 2021 and became a
 
01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:29.780 align:start position:0%
2022 bill which I think it was retained
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
that passed the house and the Senate and
 
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
was vetoed at that time by the governor
 
01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
the reason for this
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
is the question of
 
01:43:43.370 --> 01:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
you know who has to okay who represents
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
the people
 
01:43:46.729 --> 01:43:46.739 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be an extended state
 
01:43:49.850 --> 01:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
of emergency clearly the governor needs
 
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
some power to act on his own to deal
 
01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
with an emergency in the moment we we're
 
01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:55.739 align:start position:0%
not a very rapidly responding
 
01:43:55.739 --> 01:43:57.890 align:start position:0%
not a very rapidly responding
organization

01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
um and what this bill allows is the
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
governor to declare a state of emergency
 
01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
for up to 21 days and renew it up to
 
01:44:07.570 --> 01:44:07.580 align:start position:0%
three times so that's a total of 84 days
 
01:44:11.689 --> 01:44:11.699 align:start position:0%
after that point I think that you know
 
01:44:13.250 --> 01:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
to continue it beyond that the
 
01:44:14.689 --> 01:44:14.699 align:start position:0%
representatives the people both the
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate should both agree
 
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
that it needs to extend
 
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
and that's based on actually what's in
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
the Constitution if you look at part one
 
01:44:25.209 --> 01:44:25.219 align:start position:0%
article 37
 
01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
in the government of this state the
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
three essential Powers there to there to
 
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
wit the legislative executive and
 
01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:32.570 align:start position:0%
wit the legislative executive and
judicial

01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
ought to be kept separate from and
 
01:44:35.810 --> 01:44:35.820 align:start position:0%
independent of each other as the nature
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
of a free government will admit
 
01:44:40.129 --> 01:44:40.139 align:start position:0%
or is this consistent with that chain of
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
connection that binds the whole fabric
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
of the constitution in one indissoluable
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
Bond of unity and Union anonymity and um
 
01:44:51.649 --> 01:44:51.659 align:start position:0%
so that recognizes there can be some
 
01:44:54.649 --> 01:44:54.659 align:start position:0%
situations where that won't be followed
 
01:44:54.659 --> 01:44:56.090 align:start position:0%
situations where that won't be followed
but

01:44:56.090 --> 01:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:56.930 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
it should be kept separate to the extent
 
01:45:01.490 --> 01:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
it as at all possible and what happens
 
01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
during a state of emergency
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
is the um certainly the legislative
 
01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
branch has dropped out of the picture
 
01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:11.820 align:start position:0%
and that Duty basically goes to the
 
01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:12.770 align:start position:0%
and that Duty basically goes to the
executive

01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
executive
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
and at least some of the judicial branch
 
01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:45:18.410 --> 01:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
um and it is true that there are
 
01:45:20.209 --> 01:45:20.219 align:start position:0%
situations where for at least a period
 
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
of time that's necessary but as soon as
 
01:45:22.619 --> 01:45:23.689 align:start position:0%
of time that's necessary but as soon as
possible

01:45:23.689 --> 01:45:23.699 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
um that should end
 
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
and so even in the recent uh emergency
 
01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
we had related to uh covet pandemic
 
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
you know this the legislature met in
 
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
less than 84 days
 
01:45:39.649 --> 01:45:39.659 align:start position:0%
and almost every emergency that we've
 
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
ever every emergency ever had has been
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
shorter than that and trying to think of
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
emergencies which might extend beyond
 
01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:46.370 align:start position:0%
emergencies which might extend beyond
that

01:45:46.370 --> 01:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know even if something disastrous
 
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
happened with let's say the Seabrook
 
01:45:52.189 --> 01:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
Nuclear Power Plant
 
01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
given what's happened elsewhere we the
 
01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
legislature should be able to meet on
 
01:45:58.609 --> 01:45:58.619 align:start position:0%
the western part of the state partly
 
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
given weather patterns even if Fukushima
 
01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
which was you know much worse than
 
01:46:04.729 --> 01:46:04.739 align:start position:0%
anything Seabrook could do partly
 
01:46:04.739 --> 01:46:06.350 align:start position:0%
anything Seabrook could do partly
because

01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:46:08.830 --> 01:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
um you know more reactors and everything
 
01:46:12.530 --> 01:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
it was safe to be within the distance we
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
have in the state from Seabrook you know
 
01:46:17.689 --> 01:46:17.699 align:start position:0%
in less than that amount of time
 
01:46:19.729 --> 01:46:19.739 align:start position:0%
so the main difference between the
 
01:46:25.490 --> 01:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
current statute of 445 and this is that
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
currently the legislature has the right
 
01:46:30.109 --> 01:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
to choose to meet
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
and to vote to end the state of
 
01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:33.290 align:start position:0%
and to vote to end the state of
emergency

01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:46:35.209 --> 01:46:35.219 align:start position:0%
and that would require a majority of
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
both the house and the Senate and also
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
overcoming the inertia of choosing to
 
01:46:42.649 --> 01:46:42.659 align:start position:0%
meet it's I mean it's it's a normal
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
human and organizational thing that
 
01:46:47.689 --> 01:46:47.699 align:start position:0%
if you don't have to do something
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
difficult and you don't have to take
 
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
responsibility for something there's a
 
01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
tremendous Temptation not to do so and
 
01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
to leave it off on someone else in this
 
01:46:59.090 --> 01:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
case it would be the legislature I would
 
01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
say being derelict in their
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility and leaving it to the
 
01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:04.199 align:start position:0%
governor and it's just natural that
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's a tendency for people to do
 
01:47:11.090 --> 01:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
um what this would do is after a maximum
 
01:47:14.209 --> 01:47:14.219 align:start position:0%
of 84 days if the legislature felt that
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
the emergency should extend it would
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
have to meet and have to have a majority
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
vote to extend the well in effect to
 
01:47:22.970 --> 01:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
declare the emergency again
 
01:47:25.609 --> 01:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
and I believe that you know that's
 
01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional it's reasonable and
 
01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:29.689 align:start position:0%
constitutional it's reasonable and
practical

01:47:29.689 --> 01:47:29.699 align:start position:0%
practical
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
um you know even in a very bad emergency
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
that should be possible
 
01:47:37.850 --> 01:47:37.860 align:start position:0%
the other issue is that through a
 
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
process that I don't fully understand we
 
01:47:44.689 --> 01:47:44.699 align:start position:0%
had House Bill 417 and committee
 
01:47:46.609 --> 01:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
conference was deadlocked some other
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
people here were on that
 
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
and during that there was a call down to
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
OLS to get any Amendment drafted and
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
what they came up with was something
 
01:47:56.930 --> 01:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
that nobody on the committee conference
 
01:47:59.930 --> 01:47:59.940 align:start position:0%
wanted however somehow that's what ended
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
up being included in hb2 in 2021 and I'm
 
01:48:04.970 --> 01:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
not going to go into details but there
 
01:48:06.290 --> 01:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
are some
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh problems potentially with that it
 
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
says the the governor shall you know
 
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
after 90 days the governor shall call
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
pursuant to Art part two in article 50
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution and
 
01:48:19.129 --> 01:48:19.139 align:start position:0%
address a joint session of the general
 
01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
court and she'll provide a written copy
 
01:48:22.609 --> 01:48:22.619 align:start position:0%
of the address to all members of both
 
01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
chambers within five anyway it goes on
 
01:48:27.649 --> 01:48:27.659 align:start position:0%
and so it's you know there again it
 
01:48:28.850 --> 01:48:28.860 align:start position:0%
would take both the house and the Senate
 
01:48:30.590 --> 01:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
and the state of emergency
 
01:48:32.810 --> 01:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
but what's currently in statute requires
 
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
that um that there be a joint session
 
01:48:38.450 --> 01:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
called within 90 days
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
so adopting 275 you know this bill would
 
01:48:45.890 --> 01:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
not I'm sorry 127 too many versions
 
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
um would not add some new requirement
 
01:48:49.850 --> 01:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
that the legislature meet to extend the
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
 
01:48:53.689 --> 01:48:53.699 align:start position:0%
but there's a requirement now in statute
 
01:48:56.330 --> 01:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
that the legislature meet within 90 days
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
which is about the same amount of time
 
01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
I mean the real substantive difference
 
01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
to think about is you know I mean all
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
these bills we're hearing here for them
 
01:49:08.570 --> 01:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
to go into effect requires a majority of
 
01:49:10.609 --> 01:49:10.619 align:start position:0%
both the house and the Senate just to
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
pass normal bills
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
and I believe that to
 
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
um in fact suspend part of the
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
Constitution if we want to continue that
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
a long time it should require at least
 
01:49:23.689 --> 01:49:23.699 align:start position:0%
the same threshold of the house and the
 
01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
Senate a majority in both voting to
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
continue the state of emergency because
 
01:49:31.129 --> 01:49:31.139 align:start position:0%
I think that's much more serious
 
01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
than just passing you know any of the
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
bills we pass and the people need to be
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
represented in that process thank you
 
01:49:41.149 --> 01:49:41.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
01:49:41.159 --> 01:49:42.410 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
questions

01:49:42.410 --> 01:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
01:49:48.530 --> 01:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you so uh
 
01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
you referenced earlier in your statement
 
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.370 align:start position:0%
you referenced earlier in your statement
that

01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
um that they're in a state of emergency
 
01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:57.550 align:start position:0%
um that they're in a state of emergency
that

01:49:57.550 --> 01:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:50:00.410 --> 01:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
tends to elicit a response from the
 
01:50:03.649 --> 01:50:03.659 align:start position:0%
responsible authorities but is it not
 
01:50:06.410 --> 01:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
also equally the case that such
 
01:50:10.729 --> 01:50:10.739 align:start position:0%
situations lend themselves to uh
 
01:50:10.739 --> 01:50:13.310 align:start position:0%
situations lend themselves to uh
um

01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.689 --> 01:50:16.699 align:start position:0%
people yelling for the sake of
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
attracting attention to themselves not
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
to solving the emergency
 
01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
thank you I mean people will do all
 
01:50:25.970 --> 01:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
sorts of things
 
01:50:27.530 --> 01:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
um you know people do that in response
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
to requests for bills
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean that we should
 
01:50:32.689 --> 01:50:32.699 align:start position:0%
appoint the governor's dictator and the
 
01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
legislature should step down and not
 
01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
bother legislating
 
01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
is that really the alternative
 
01:50:45.229 --> 01:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:46.910 --> 01:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
I'm so glad to hear
 
01:50:49.490 --> 01:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
01:50:52.010 --> 01:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien thank you madam
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:50:55.679 --> 01:50:57.109 align:start position:0%
taking the question
um

01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
coming from the emergency
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
field so to speak you can only report to
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
one God
 
01:51:07.010 --> 01:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
okay that's the best way that the
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
situation works you haven't got other
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
people that's why we delegate as we
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned with the incident command
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
system and everything do you find it
 
01:51:19.010 --> 01:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
that would be counterintuitive I mean at
 
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
least the governor's establishing he uh
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
has declared an emergency if it goes too
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
long it sometimes they do but when I'm
 
01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
trying to get at you need just to have
 
01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
one person able to make that when you
 
01:51:35.689 --> 01:51:35.699 align:start position:0%
get the house involved and the Senate
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
involved then it starts to become like
 
01:51:41.290 --> 01:51:41.300 align:start position:0%
perhaps maybe political I I understand
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh the issue
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
um uh two things one is the legislature
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
I don't see the legislature
 
01:51:51.709 --> 01:51:51.719 align:start position:0%
micromanaging the emergency response the
 
01:51:53.570 --> 01:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
only thing that they're deciding in this
 
01:51:58.250 --> 01:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
case is after 84 days is it appropriate
 
01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
for the this to remain an emergency
 
01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
where the governor had continues those
 
01:52:06.530 --> 01:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
emergency Powers
 
01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
um it's either yes or no on that and if
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
the governor is permitted to continue
 
01:52:12.770 --> 01:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
then he'll have the emergency Powers he
 
01:52:14.689 --> 01:52:14.699 align:start position:0%
normally has and he'd be the one God to
 
01:52:16.970 --> 01:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
report to so to speak
 
01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:17.689 align:start position:0%
report to so to speak
um

01:52:17.689 --> 01:52:17.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
and and everything's political I mean
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
everything we do is political making all
 
01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
the decisions are political
 
01:52:27.050 --> 01:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
and a decision on whether the governor
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
can maintain extraordinary powers
 
01:52:32.689 --> 01:52:32.699 align:start position:0%
that were you know put in effect some
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
parts of the Constitution of bands yes
 
01:52:36.890 --> 01:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
that's a political question but it's a
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
question where the the people of the
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
state deserve to have their
 
01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:42.770 align:start position:0%
state deserve to have their
representatives

01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
um involved in making that decision and
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
I think it's critical that both the
 
01:52:49.129 --> 01:52:49.139 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate have to agree to it
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
I mean the house is the body closest to
 
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
the people most representative of the
 
01:52:55.970 --> 01:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
people and they should have to agree as
 
01:52:58.250 --> 01:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
well as the Senate if if an
 
01:52:59.689 --> 01:52:59.699 align:start position:0%
extraordinary thing such a state of
 
01:53:01.609 --> 01:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
emergency is going to go on for that
 
01:53:04.370 --> 01:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
long and it is allowed to go on for a
 
01:53:07.609 --> 01:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
long time so if there are early on you
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
know confusion and and concerns and
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
political hoo-ha or whatever
 
01:53:15.050 --> 01:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
um there's time for that to to work its
 
01:53:16.370 --> 01:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
course so it's not going to block the
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
what exactly is the most egregious thing
 
01:53:28.189 --> 01:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
that a governor could do during a state
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
of emergency I mean that's speculation
 
01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to get into
 
01:53:34.189 --> 01:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
um you know you can imagine whatever you
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
like that's not really a question an
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate question to ask represent of
 
01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
your heart I'd like to mention that we
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
have from our researcher a list of
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
states of emergency yes a list of states
 
01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
of emergencies what they happened and
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
the history of Emergency Management
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
legislation at least the most recent
 
01:53:56.450 --> 01:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
ones uh and representative Poole do you
 
01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
have a question I do thank you madam
 
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative
 
01:54:03.169 --> 01:54:03.179 align:start position:0%
did you say that that
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
what you're asking for in 127 is already
 
01:54:09.530 --> 01:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
in law but it's 90 days instead of 84
 
01:54:11.689 --> 01:54:11.699 align:start position:0%
days am I missed that's not quite
 
01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
um well it's already in law is that
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
um the governor is required to call a
 
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
let me find it here
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh what was required to call a joint
 
01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
session of the legislature
 
01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
um every 90 days you know after the
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
first 90 days and if it Contin the
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
legislature agrees to continue goes
 
01:54:34.850 --> 01:54:34.860 align:start position:0%
beyond that and that's similar to the 84
 
01:54:36.530 --> 01:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
days in this bill the the main
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
difference is
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
in the current statute to end the state
 
01:54:42.169 --> 01:54:42.179 align:start position:0%
of emergency it would take both the
 
01:54:43.850 --> 01:54:43.860 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate a majority of them
 
01:54:45.290 --> 01:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
voting to end it
 
01:54:48.290 --> 01:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
that if this bill were to become law it
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
would require a majority of the house
 
01:54:53.209 --> 01:54:53.219 align:start position:0%
and the Senate to continue it
 
01:54:56.209 --> 01:54:56.219 align:start position:0%
yes and I'd like to mention that within
 
01:54:59.330 --> 01:54:59.340 align:start position:0%
90 days after the Declaration of the
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
covet emergency the house met and voted
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
on ending the state of emergency and
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
that motion failed
 
01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
right in fact I can respond that's true
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
and you know I'm not saying that all
 
01:55:15.229 --> 01:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
states of emergency should end after 84
 
01:55:16.850 --> 01:55:16.860 align:start position:0%
days I'm saying after that period of
 
01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:17.689 align:start position:0%
days I'm saying after that period of
time

01:55:17.689 --> 01:55:17.699 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:55:19.490 --> 01:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
you know the representatives of people
 
01:55:22.010 --> 01:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
have a duty to make a decision on
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:29.149 align:start position:0%
 
true

01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.609 --> 01:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
because I'm trying to read this and
 
01:55:35.149 --> 01:55:35.159 align:start position:0%
listen to you and I'm not doing well so
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
after 84 days
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature meets
 
01:55:42.890 --> 01:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
and decides that it will continue
 
01:55:45.050 --> 01:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
does that continue for another 84 days
 
01:55:47.570 --> 01:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
is that if
 
01:55:49.310 --> 01:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
um actually what happened what an effect
 
01:55:51.649 --> 01:55:51.659 align:start position:0%
happens is
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
um I mean the legislature could meet
 
01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
any time during those 84 days to end it
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
if they both you know both bodies
 
01:56:02.209 --> 01:56:02.219 align:start position:0%
decided to end it but at 84 days it
 
01:56:03.950 --> 01:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
actually the governor can't continue it
 
01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
what really happens is that the
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
legislature meets and declares a state
 
01:56:09.530 --> 01:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
of emergency the bill gives the
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
legislature the ability to declare one
 
01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
for up to 90 days and that's rather than
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
the 21 for the governor because it's
 
01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
more overhead with the legislature to
 
01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:20.810 align:start position:0%
more overhead with the legislature to
meet

01:56:20.810 --> 01:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
meet
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
um you know if if after 84 days Plus 90
 
01:56:27.050 --> 01:56:27.060 align:start position:0%
days the legislature thinks it needs to
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
continue they'd have to meet again and
 
01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
extend it and that's there's no limit to
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
how long the legislature could choose to
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:56:39.649 --> 01:56:39.659 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:56:57.950 --> 01:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Tom Manion I'm
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro One Pelham I'm
 
01:57:02.570 --> 01:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
here to speak in support of hb127
 
01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
despite a predecessor bill being vetoed
 
01:57:07.129 --> 01:57:07.139 align:start position:0%
last term the governor in his 2023
 
01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
inauguration speech had this to say
 
01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we distilled decision
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
making down to the lowest possible level
 
01:57:15.649 --> 01:57:15.659 align:start position:0%
of power empowering individuals to make
 
01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
their voices heard at the local level
 
01:57:19.729 --> 01:57:19.739 align:start position:0%
where their voice is the greatest
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
sounds clear-cut that decision making
 
01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
should be in the hands of the people
 
01:57:25.370 --> 01:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
as one of the largest representative
 
01:57:27.410 --> 01:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
bodies in the world the voices from the
 
01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
local level are Amplified through their
 
01:57:31.250 --> 01:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
representation better here than any
 
01:57:32.450 --> 01:57:32.460 align:start position:0%
other state
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
if our districts require that a state of
 
01:57:36.530 --> 01:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
emergency continue then this body would
 
01:57:38.689 --> 01:57:38.699 align:start position:0%
be most knowledgeable about the
 
01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
individual circumstances and can vote
 
01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
accordingly to extend it
 
01:57:44.450 --> 01:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
at the federal level since the passing
 
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
of the National Emergency acts in 1976
 
01:57:49.070 --> 01:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
the Office of the President has declared
 
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
79 National emergencies and 42 are still
 
01:57:54.649 --> 01:57:54.659 align:start position:0%
in effect to this day
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
the structure for ending these
 
01:57:57.649 --> 01:57:57.659 align:start position:0%
emergencies is the same as New Hampshire
 
01:57:59.689 --> 01:57:59.699 align:start position:0%
requiring the legislative branch to vote
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
to end them
 
01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
and since the gridlock is not uncommon
 
01:58:06.050 --> 01:58:06.060 align:start position:0%
at any level of government they persist
 
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
it's troubling to think a governor that
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
may run for president is comfortable
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
with retaining such power in his current
 
01:58:14.209 --> 01:58:14.219 align:start position:0%
position and what that mean what that
 
01:58:15.649 --> 01:58:15.659 align:start position:0%
could mean for the country should they
 
01:58:17.570 --> 01:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
win a presidential run
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
the default state for any citizen should
 
01:58:20.689 --> 01:58:20.699 align:start position:0%
always be freedom from government
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
interference in their lives emergency or
 
01:58:25.129 --> 01:58:25.139 align:start position:0%
otherwise and this body should have to
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
convene and act on behalf of the desires
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
of our constituents to disrupt that
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
freedom only if absolutely necessary it
 
01:58:35.209 --> 01:58:35.219 align:start position:0%
should not be a battle to return Liberty
 
01:58:36.649 --> 01:58:36.659 align:start position:0%
to Granite Staters and this bill
 
01:58:38.810 --> 01:58:38.820 align:start position:0%
corrects that I will ask the committee
 
01:58:41.450 --> 01:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
to OTP hb-127 and I'm willing to take
 
01:58:42.770 --> 01:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
01:58:48.239 --> 01:58:49.370 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
much

01:58:49.370 --> 01:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:58:56.290 --> 01:58:56.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I will I will
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
close representative already speaking on
 
01:59:04.850 --> 01:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
House Bill 127.
 
01:59:07.010 --> 01:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
I will close the public hearing on House
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.370 --> 01:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
nervous against
 
01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:28.430 align:start position:0%
nervous against
um

01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
what

01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
01:59:41.629 --> 01:59:41.639 align:start position:0%
all right uh under the circumstances I
 
01:59:43.490 --> 01:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
think we should go into executive
 
01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:44.570 align:start position:0%
think we should go into executive
session

01:59:44.570 --> 01:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 127
 
01:59:50.570 --> 01:59:50.580 align:start position:0%
representative leckis you have a motion
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes I move on to pass for House Bill
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
127. a second okay we have a motion and
 
01:59:59.089 --> 01:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
a second you
 
02:00:01.370 --> 02:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
I I think I just did
 
02:00:01.380 --> 02:00:02.030 align:start position:0%
I I think I just did
um

02:00:02.030 --> 02:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
and then just to reiterate I mean you
 
02:00:07.370 --> 02:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
know having a state of emergency and
 
02:00:09.770 --> 02:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
suspending the normal legislative and to
 
02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
some extent constitutional process is
 
02:00:14.450 --> 02:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
02:00:16.729 --> 02:00:16.739 align:start position:0%
truly extraordinary and should only be
 
02:00:19.370 --> 02:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
done if absolutely necessary and only
 
02:00:22.010 --> 02:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
for as long as absolutely necessary 84
 
02:00:24.169 --> 02:00:24.179 align:start position:0%
days for that's a long time I actually
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
would have preferred somewhat less but
 
02:00:28.850 --> 02:00:28.860 align:start position:0%
that was a reasonable compromise so
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
um and I think that it's critical if
 
02:00:33.470 --> 02:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to continue beyond that
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
um that both the both bodies the house
 
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
and the Senate have to agree as they do
 
02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
for any bill
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
um that'll continue after that thank you
 
02:00:44.149 --> 02:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
okay represent Simon Jewish to speak to
 
02:00:46.250 --> 02:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
your second uh yeah just briefly I would
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
add to that just because sometimes it's
 
02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
easy to wrap your mind around it's
 
02:00:51.890 --> 02:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
almost three months so it's a very long
 
02:00:53.930 --> 02:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
time for the governor to have that kind
 
02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
of levity and we do have a
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility to our constituents to
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
weigh in their concerns as well so okay
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:09.229 --> 02:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative O'Brien well thank
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I was going to speak on
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
the bill if it is open at this time uh
 
02:01:16.370 --> 02:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
and I myself am not going to support it
 
02:01:19.930 --> 02:01:19.940 align:start position:0%
uh we're talking about very rare events
 
02:01:23.330 --> 02:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
and I think in this particular situation
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
I think we all can remember what we went
 
02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
through with the covet strain and that
 
02:01:30.410 --> 02:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
seemed to be precipitated into
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
discussing this particular thing and I
 
02:01:35.870 --> 02:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
hate bringing up and changing law and
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
rules of the Constitution when you're
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
using the example of something as
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
radical as the covet maybe it would be
 
02:01:45.649 --> 02:01:45.659 align:start position:0%
better to discuss this at a like a later
 
02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:48.300 align:start position:0%
date when there was nothing and just
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
looked at the true merits whether it's
 
02:01:53.689 --> 02:01:53.699 align:start position:0%
an emergency or not but I think at the
 
02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
political women of the people I think
 
02:01:58.370 --> 02:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
people understand when an emergency can
 
02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
go too far and sometimes it may not go
 
02:02:04.970 --> 02:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
far enough so
 
02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
the way it is right now I don't have any
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
particular problem with the governor
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
declare in the state of emergency uh
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's like in previous testimony we hear
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh my experience you know with fires and
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
different things a minute can seem like
 
02:02:25.010 --> 02:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
an hour and in an emergency situation
 
02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
clean up when you get into the recovery
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's all coveted into uh trying to get
 
02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
things back to normal and it can be
 
02:02:36.410 --> 02:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
years to get things back to normal and
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
is not covered still a ball around the
 
02:02:42.589 --> 02:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
chain so again whereas
 
02:02:45.649 --> 02:02:45.659 align:start position:0%
this bill I don't know I wonder if it's
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
contaminated by the covert clause
 
02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
and I would just like to keep it just
 
02:02:53.810 --> 02:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
basically discussing the merits and I
 
02:02:55.550 --> 02:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
would feel much more comfortable at a
 
02:02:58.070 --> 02:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
later date bringing that forward thank
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
you representative Schmidt did you have
 
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:06.770 --> 02:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
I do have a comment
 
02:03:11.229 --> 02:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
no one else does so I appreciate the
 
02:03:15.649 --> 02:03:15.659 align:start position:0%
attempt to Tinker with the current
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
statute it may be a slight Improvement
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is in my opinion
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we confronted a 100 Year event
 
02:03:28.729 --> 02:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen anything like it since
 
02:03:28.739 --> 02:03:29.629 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen anything like it since
the

02:03:29.629 --> 02:03:29.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
famous Spanish flu as it's misnamed
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
and all things considered I think the
 
02:03:40.609 --> 02:03:40.619 align:start position:0%
governor did a responsible job under a
 
02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
difficult difficult situation and and
 
02:03:47.629 --> 02:03:47.639 align:start position:0%
largely I believe that the people of New
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh recognized a an a seminal
 
02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:54.609 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh recognized a an a seminal
event

02:03:54.609 --> 02:03:54.619 align:start position:0%
event
 
02:03:59.209 --> 02:03:59.219 align:start position:0%
and responded appropriately and that
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
most of their furore was generated by
 
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
people who either didn't understand the
 
02:04:07.790 --> 02:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
situation or didn't acknowledge the
 
02:04:11.209 --> 02:04:11.219 align:start position:0%
reality of it and it was demagogue to
 
02:04:13.250 --> 02:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
death by some people thank you
 
02:04:16.129 --> 02:04:16.139 align:start position:0%
representative I I'm entitled to make my
 
02:04:19.250 --> 02:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
statement you are not entitled to impugn
 
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
their motives however some people I said
 
02:04:27.649 --> 02:04:27.659 align:start position:0%
okay some people and and this is is not
 
02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
worth the trouble of going forward in my
 
02:04:32.030 --> 02:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
opinion I will be voting against it
 
02:04:34.510 --> 02:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh a bear because you
 
02:04:38.830 --> 02:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
haven't had a shot yet
 
02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair in the spirit
 
02:04:45.410 --> 02:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
of discussion I will be supporting HB
 
02:04:47.169 --> 02:04:47.179 align:start position:0%
127 100
 
02:04:51.169 --> 02:04:51.179 align:start position:0%
I can tell you in it is the exclusive
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
one reason why I ran for office and why
 
02:04:57.290 --> 02:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
I'm here and I'd also like to say that
 
02:05:00.290 --> 02:05:00.300 align:start position:0%
what I've experienced and seen is that I
 
02:05:01.970 --> 02:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
have a business with 50 employees
 
02:05:03.890 --> 02:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
fortunately we were deemed essential
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
what was told for us for a state of
 
02:05:09.169 --> 02:05:09.179 align:start position:0%
emergency closing down for a few weeks
 
02:05:11.330 --> 02:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
turned into
 
02:05:13.790 --> 02:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
weeks and weeks where we lost in
 
02:05:16.729 --> 02:05:16.739 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and New Hampshire
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
commercial tenants at least 10 different
 
02:05:21.229 --> 02:05:21.239 align:start position:0%
tenants with an average of three to five
 
02:05:23.810 --> 02:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
employees each if our business had not
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
been deemed essential we would have lost
 
02:05:27.050 --> 02:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
another 50 employees in our company
 
02:05:29.870 --> 02:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
would have closed so I will support HB
 
02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
127 100 thank you okay representative
 
02:05:33.239 --> 02:05:34.910 align:start position:0%
127 100 thank you okay representative
Gould

02:05:34.910 --> 02:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
Gould
 
02:05:36.589 --> 02:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just want to
 
02:05:38.209 --> 02:05:38.219 align:start position:0%
make sure again I'm understanding so at
 
02:05:40.370 --> 02:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
the end of the 90 days the governor has
 
02:05:43.010 --> 02:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
to call The Joint session and then the
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
legislature has to vote to agree to
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
continue it no under current law the
 
02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:49.129 align:start position:0%
continue it no under current law the
legislature

02:05:49.129 --> 02:05:49.139 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:05:51.470 --> 02:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
he the governor has to call The Joint
 
02:05:54.649 --> 02:05:54.659 align:start position:0%
session and the legislature I'm not sure
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
if they have to vote on it but their
 
02:05:59.149 --> 02:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
vote will be to end the state of
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
emergency thank you my dyslexia Madam
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
chair I said that backwards so so I
 
02:06:06.649 --> 02:06:06.659 align:start position:0%
understand correctly that at the end of
 
02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
the 90 days the legislature
 
02:06:10.850 --> 02:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
automatically goes in and can end the
 
02:06:13.129 --> 02:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
state of emergency under the current law
 
02:06:15.050 --> 02:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
02:06:15.060 --> 02:06:16.450 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
okay

02:06:16.450 --> 02:06:16.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:22.689 --> 02:06:22.699 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative grotta I'm sorry I didn't
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:06:29.450 --> 02:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
so I am not going to support House Bill
 
02:06:32.810 --> 02:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
127 because we have this Authority
 
02:06:35.209 --> 02:06:35.219 align:start position:0%
already and this is really for me
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
splitting hairs and it's not and it's
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
not as if the governor is um it is a
 
02:06:45.709 --> 02:06:45.719 align:start position:0%
dictator and um he um has very limited
 
02:06:47.209 --> 02:06:47.219 align:start position:0%
powers if you compare him to other
 
02:06:49.970 --> 02:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
Governors and he does have access to the
 
02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
agencies that are the ones who work
 
02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
during these during these crises and
 
02:06:57.410 --> 02:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
therefore I do believe that in these
 
02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
situations that position has
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
the ability to weigh decisions carefully
 
02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
and since the house can meet to
 
02:07:08.750 --> 02:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
terminate the State of Emergency on
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
their own this is not necessary thank
 
02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you representative
 
02:07:15.490 --> 02:07:15.500 align:start position:0%
uh like us our assignment
 
02:07:18.169 --> 02:07:18.179 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you just uh to
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
respond to some of the comments um
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah actually the last one I you know
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
the governor nor under normal
 
02:07:27.229 --> 02:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances has very limited powers
 
02:07:29.149 --> 02:07:29.159 align:start position:0%
but under a declared state of emergency
 
02:07:32.330 --> 02:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
as very extensive powers and uh
 
02:07:35.149 --> 02:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm I'm not and and this is
 
02:07:38.089 --> 02:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
not well the covet situation brought
 
02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
this statute to people's attention
 
02:07:42.410 --> 02:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
because I didn't even know it was there
 
02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
and many people I've talked to didn't
 
02:07:47.689 --> 02:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
this is not about whether the covet
 
02:07:49.629 --> 02:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
emergency was handled correctly or not
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's not my concern and actually I am
 
02:07:55.729 --> 02:07:55.739 align:start position:0%
fairly confident that if this law were
 
02:07:58.189 --> 02:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
in place prior to covid that the
 
02:07:59.930 --> 02:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
legislature probably would have met and
 
02:08:01.550 --> 02:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
probably would have voted they may very
 
02:08:02.990 --> 02:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
well have voted to extend the state of
 
02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
emergency that's not what this is about
 
02:08:07.550 --> 02:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's the legislature
 
02:08:11.209 --> 02:08:11.219 align:start position:0%
has to take responsibility for it and in
 
02:08:13.729 --> 02:08:13.739 align:start position:0%
one hand it's you know representing the
 
02:08:15.470 --> 02:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
people and if representing them in
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
passing bills requires both bodies to go
 
02:08:20.510 --> 02:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
along with it you know for something I
 
02:08:22.850 --> 02:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
see is much more serious they should as
 
02:08:25.370 --> 02:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
well and the other thing is at that
 
02:08:27.169 --> 02:08:27.179 align:start position:0%
point the legislature actually if they
 
02:08:29.089 --> 02:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
just vote to extend it are taking
 
02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
they're taking the governor's back
 
02:08:33.070 --> 02:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
you know they're helping to support him
 
02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
in what he believes is necessary and and
 
02:08:37.970 --> 02:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
I think that's important
 
02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:38.990 align:start position:0%
I think that's important
um

02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
see what else and it it's you know this
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
is not brought on because of political
 
02:08:45.890 --> 02:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
whatever you know there's no coveted
 
02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
clause in this bill
 
02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
um but but the only reason it's in close
 
02:08:53.270 --> 02:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
proximity to covet is that this hasn't
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
been used since 445 was put in
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
um after 9 11. yeah after 9 11.
 
02:09:00.239 --> 02:09:01.010 align:start position:0%
um after 9 11. yeah after 9 11.
um

02:09:01.010 --> 02:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:03.050 --> 02:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
and but so I think it's a good time to
 
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know we have some distance from what
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
happened and as I said I am not in this
 
02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
taking a position on whether covet was
 
02:09:13.609 --> 02:09:13.619 align:start position:0%
handled correctly I think this bill
 
02:09:15.709 --> 02:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
should be supported even if you believe
 
02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
the governor handled covet perfectly
 
02:09:20.689 --> 02:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
because for one thing it is the
 
02:09:23.109 --> 02:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the legislature to
 
02:09:25.970 --> 02:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
when it's possible to weigh in on this
 
02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
and second of all you never know what's
 
02:09:29.930 --> 02:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
going to happen in the future and the
 
02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
problem is you can say well it's a
 
02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
hundred year event but the issue is once
 
02:09:35.629 --> 02:09:35.639 align:start position:0%
you're in the emergency you can't do
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
anything about it if you you know you
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
have to think about it ahead of time and
 
02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
make any adjustments to what should
 
02:09:44.450 --> 02:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
happen during an emergency beforehand
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative Golan
 
02:09:53.810 --> 02:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I will not be
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
supporting this we keep hearing over and
 
02:09:58.970 --> 02:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
over about the legislative chair having
 
02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:04.370 --> 02:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
and let me just go on and read what's
 
02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
current in statute as such time at such
 
02:10:10.490 --> 02:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
joint session the legislature shall vote
 
02:10:12.050 --> 02:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
on whether to terminate the state of
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
emergency by concurrent resolution
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
adopted by a simple majority of leave
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
both Chambers acting separately with the
 
02:10:19.970 --> 02:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
following questions show the current
 
02:10:22.250 --> 02:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
state of emergency be terminated
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
so I keep hearing over and over again
 
02:10:27.589 --> 02:10:27.599 align:start position:0%
that the legislature needs to have input
 
02:10:30.290 --> 02:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
I think what I just read states that the
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
legislature has input now
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
so I can't support it we already have it
 
02:10:36.290 --> 02:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
we took a vote during the state of
 
02:10:40.850 --> 02:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
emergency as the chair stated earlier it
 
02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:42.530 align:start position:0%
emergency as the chair stated earlier it
failed

02:10:42.530 --> 02:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
failed
 
02:10:44.689 --> 02:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
the opportunity is there this is not
 
02:10:44.699 --> 02:10:46.010 align:start position:0%
the opportunity is there this is not
needed

02:10:46.010 --> 02:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Simon
 
02:10:52.250 --> 02:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
finally and then thank you madam chair
 
02:10:54.109 --> 02:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would just add to the
 
02:10:56.810 --> 02:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
conversation that when these rules were
 
02:10:59.770 --> 02:10:59.780 align:start position:0%
instituted back in 2011 after 9 11
 
02:11:03.890 --> 02:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
the intent of uh yeah sorry 2001.
 
02:11:06.229 --> 02:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
um the intent of them
 
02:11:08.209 --> 02:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
was pretty well understood by the people
 
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
who put them into statute and when they
 
02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
made those rules they did not have a
 
02:11:14.689 --> 02:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
pandemic in mind
 
02:11:17.570 --> 02:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
um as as a reason for why these
 
02:11:19.850 --> 02:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
emergency Powers might be enacted we
 
02:11:22.129 --> 02:11:22.139 align:start position:0%
still don't know the reasons all reasons
 
02:11:24.050 --> 02:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
why an emergency a state of emergency
 
02:11:26.089 --> 02:11:26.099 align:start position:0%
might be in enacted
 
02:11:26.099 --> 02:11:26.750 align:start position:0%
might be in enacted
um

02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:28.250 --> 02:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
it could be something that we're not
 
02:11:30.169 --> 02:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
even thinking of right now the one main
 
02:11:33.229 --> 02:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
difference between this bill and what is
 
02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
currently in statute is that if the
 
02:11:37.550 --> 02:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
legislative body for whatever reason
 
02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
abdicates its responsibility
 
02:11:43.250 --> 02:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
and doesn't show up to vote the state of
 
02:11:46.070 --> 02:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
emergency continues whereas if the
 
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
legislature abdicates its responsibility
 
02:11:52.129 --> 02:11:52.139 align:start position:0%
if 127 passes and doesn't show up to
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
vote the state of emergency ends
 
02:11:57.649 --> 02:11:57.659 align:start position:0%
that is the main difference between what
 
02:12:00.169 --> 02:12:00.179 align:start position:0%
is currently in statute and what 127 is
 
02:12:02.689 --> 02:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish and we should not
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
be abdicating our responsibility to show
 
02:12:08.089 --> 02:12:08.099 align:start position:0%
up and take action the the governor has
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
to he has to call a joint session 90
 
02:12:12.649 --> 02:12:12.659 align:start position:0%
days after that doesn't mean we have to
 
02:12:15.229 --> 02:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
show up and vote and right now if we
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
don't show up and vote if there's not a
 
02:12:19.070 --> 02:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
quorum then it just automatically
 
02:12:21.410 --> 02:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
continues we we should have to show up
 
02:12:23.209 --> 02:12:23.219 align:start position:0%
and act on that
 
02:12:25.790 --> 02:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
and and give the people's opinion that's
 
02:12:28.129 --> 02:12:28.139 align:start position:0%
just that's just my feeling on it
 
02:12:30.109 --> 02:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
02:12:32.570 --> 02:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
I'll rock some Gerhard
 
02:12:34.129 --> 02:12:34.139 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I concur with
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative Simon that is more of an
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
opt-in than an opt-out kind of scenario
 
02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
I think that's definitely necessary my
 
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
concern is that fear is the ultimate
 
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
controller of people and by instituting
 
02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
a state emergency the governor is
 
02:12:51.709 --> 02:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
basically implying that there's a
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
dangerous thing at at hand and we must
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
extend these powers that we would never
 
02:13:00.050 --> 02:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
under normal circumstances extend to
 
02:13:01.850 --> 02:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
them and I feel especially in the covet
 
02:13:03.229 --> 02:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
situation if we want to talk about that
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
that has resulted in excessive
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
death and issues with the vaccine that
 
02:13:09.890 --> 02:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
were pushed later on I think that's
 
02:13:11.870 --> 02:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
important to remember so I don't even
 
02:13:13.550 --> 02:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
want to start that ball rolling down the
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
hill ever again because I think it just
 
02:13:16.910 --> 02:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
leads to more and more problems and
 
02:13:17.930 --> 02:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
we're going to be seeing these for many
 
02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
years to come so I will be supporting
 
02:13:22.129 --> 02:13:22.139 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative goalie
 
02:13:24.589 --> 02:13:24.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I was
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
going to end it but I have to respond to
 
02:13:29.450 --> 02:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative Simon because we were in
 
02:13:31.490 --> 02:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
a pandemic that lasted longer than 90
 
02:13:34.370 --> 02:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
days affected
 
02:13:37.250 --> 02:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
many constituents across our state and
 
02:13:39.050 --> 02:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
had deadly effects
 
02:13:41.629 --> 02:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
that we all know about and to say we had
 
02:13:44.450 --> 02:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
to meet with in 90 days
 
02:13:47.870 --> 02:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
as a group to put this forward just to
 
02:13:50.810 --> 02:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
continue it when we know at that point
 
02:13:53.569 --> 02:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
public Gatherings were not acceptable at
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
the time
 
02:13:57.050 --> 02:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
is the reason why we have in current
 
02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
statute we have versus this thank you
 
02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:01.790 align:start position:0%
statute we have versus this thank you
okay

02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:05.089 --> 02:14:05.099 align:start position:0%
all right any more representative lekkis
 
02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I just wanted to mention
 
02:14:09.470 --> 02:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
that this legislature actually did meet
 
02:14:12.589 --> 02:14:12.599 align:start position:0%
in less than 84 days even without this
 
02:14:15.649 --> 02:14:15.659 align:start position:0%
uh this legislation in place and I agree
 
02:14:18.410 --> 02:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
completely with representative Simon
 
02:14:20.209 --> 02:14:20.219 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between the
 
02:14:23.089 --> 02:14:23.099 align:start position:0%
legislature having the ability to act
 
02:14:25.069 --> 02:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
and then having the duty to act the
 
02:14:27.890 --> 02:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
requirement okay there's an assignment
 
02:14:31.550 --> 02:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
now okay all right anyone else
 
02:14:34.490 --> 02:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:36.830 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
um

02:14:36.830 --> 02:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:39.229 --> 02:14:39.239 align:start position:0%

02:16:33.889 --> 02:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:36.049 --> 02:16:36.059 align:start position:0%
right thank you that concludes that
 
02:16:43.790 --> 02:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:46.969 --> 02:16:46.979 align:start position:0%
all right and I'm opening the public
 
02:16:50.450 --> 02:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 339
 
02:16:53.929 --> 02:16:53.939 align:start position:0%
I since it turned out to be much more
 
02:16:56.030 --> 02:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
interesting to more people than I
 
02:16:59.389 --> 02:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
imagined when I set this up I'm going to
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
ask you
 
02:17:03.410 --> 02:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
based on the emails and calls I've
 
02:17:06.589 --> 02:17:06.599 align:start position:0%
gotten not to concentrate on saying
 
02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
Israel is wonderful or Israel is awful
 
02:17:12.169 --> 02:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
because that's something that everybody
 
02:17:15.770 --> 02:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
has probably made up their minds on so
 
02:17:18.049 --> 02:17:18.059 align:start position:0%
we don't need to debate that here what
 
02:17:20.990 --> 02:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
we need to discuss is what would the
 
02:17:24.889 --> 02:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
effects of the bill be and why we want
 
02:17:27.349 --> 02:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
02:17:27.359 --> 02:17:28.250 align:start position:0%
to do it
um

02:17:28.250 --> 02:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:30.530 --> 02:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
I hope that it that it's not too much of
 
02:17:32.570 --> 02:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
a problem and I will start with the
 
02:17:42.110 --> 02:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:43.849 --> 02:17:43.859 align:start position:0%

bookkeeping
 
02:18:03.709 --> 02:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
first I'm gonna let you know that you
 
02:18:05.150 --> 02:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
have the underlying bill you also have
 
02:18:06.650 --> 02:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
an amendment that was delivered
 
02:18:09.290 --> 02:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
yesterday and there's another amendment
 
02:18:11.089 --> 02:18:11.099 align:start position:0%
pending now the Second Amendment is just
 
02:18:13.310 --> 02:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
to add on
 
02:18:15.770 --> 02:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
um the contracts portion And to clarify
 
02:18:18.589 --> 02:18:18.599 align:start position:0%
what does it mean when we say boycott
 
02:18:20.750 --> 02:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
Israel so it's got a preamble section
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:28.969 --> 02:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
yep okay and I will give this passes
 
02:18:30.770 --> 02:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
around to the committee and then I have
 
02:18:32.150 --> 02:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
another amendment that I ask for coming
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
just because it was requested by legal
 
02:18:37.129 --> 02:18:37.139 align:start position:0%
counsel that they that we include a
 
02:18:39.410 --> 02:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
preamble of three legislative findings
 
02:18:41.150 --> 02:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
at the beginning to establish
 
02:18:43.370 --> 02:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
legislative intent if this ever gets
 
02:18:45.650 --> 02:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
challenged so that's very simple it's
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
just a preamble those sometimes get cut
 
02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
out anyway so it's not important to
 
02:18:51.650 --> 02:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
really get into except that it does
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
State Legislative findings
 
02:18:56.810 --> 02:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
so uh I bring before you a much needed
 
02:19:00.410 --> 02:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
Bill HB 339 this bill will help defend
 
02:19:02.209 --> 02:19:02.219 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's economy and reinforce
 
02:19:03.530 --> 02:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
our public policy through the
 
02:19:05.150 --> 02:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
responsible spending and investing of
 
02:19:08.570 --> 02:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds all while placing only a
 
02:19:10.310 --> 02:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
minimal administrative demand upon the
 
02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:11.870 align:start position:0%
minimal administrative demand upon the
state

02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
it's important for me to begin by
 
02:19:15.770 --> 02:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
clarifying that HB 339's underlying
 
02:19:18.469 --> 02:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
rationale is that the bill will create a
 
02:19:20.450 --> 02:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
basic anti-discrimination law that
 
02:19:22.370 --> 02:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
safeguards state funds from Investments
 
02:19:24.410 --> 02:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
and contracts with problematic parties
 
02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
who would otherwise undermine important
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
public policy protections upon which
 
02:19:31.250 --> 02:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
many Granite Staters rely
 
02:19:33.049 --> 02:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
as you know New Hampshire regulates
 
02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
against many forms of discrimination and
 
02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
has a duty to invest and spend States
 
02:19:40.009 --> 02:19:40.019 align:start position:0%
funds consistently to that end
 
02:19:42.349 --> 02:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
HB 339 keeps the threat of national
 
02:19:44.270 --> 02:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
origin bias away from our state's
 
02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
economy by defending our procurement and
 
02:19:48.589 --> 02:19:48.599 align:start position:0%
investment processes from discriminatory
 
02:19:50.450 --> 02:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
unethical and potent politically
 
02:19:53.750 --> 02:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
motivated business partners
 
02:19:55.250 --> 02:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
considering that most states have
 
02:19:56.570 --> 02:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
already enacted laws with language
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's similar to HB 339 and I'll tell
 
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
you this 35 already
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
that have passed a bill identical to
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
this this is model legislation or a bill
 
02:20:07.610 --> 02:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
that was a precursor to this when we
 
02:20:09.410 --> 02:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
were still working out kinks in the
 
02:20:11.570 --> 02:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
model legislation
 
02:20:13.370 --> 02:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
passing this bill helps to ensure that
 
02:20:14.810 --> 02:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's conduct requirements for
 
02:20:16.310 --> 02:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
State vendors are in line with common
 
02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
national standards and thus uniform
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
HB 339 does not place any administrative
 
02:20:24.050 --> 02:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
Duty upon the state to monitor the
 
02:20:26.170 --> 02:20:26.180 align:start position:0%
marketplace activity
 
02:20:28.610 --> 02:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
Contracting parties subject to the law
 
02:20:30.410 --> 02:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
would only need to submit a basic
 
02:20:32.929 --> 02:20:32.939 align:start position:0%
certification that they do not engage in
 
02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
discriminatory commercial practices as
 
02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
specified in the statute
 
02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
the state's prohibited Investments list
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
will also only require minimal
 
02:20:41.280 --> 02:20:42.770 align:start position:0%
will also only require minimal
Administration

02:20:42.770 --> 02:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
02:20:45.770 --> 02:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
to maintain it the officials only need
 
02:20:47.570 --> 02:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
to undertake inquiries after being
 
02:20:49.309 --> 02:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
notified of a particular case where
 
02:20:50.690 --> 02:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
there's reason to believe the parties
 
02:20:52.250 --> 02:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
may be participating in commercial
 
02:20:54.290 --> 02:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
discrimination prohibited by the statute
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
so let me clarify what that's
 
02:21:00.349 --> 02:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
essentially putting for a burden on the
 
02:21:00.359 --> 02:21:01.070 align:start position:0%
essentially putting for a burden on the
state

02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
you don't have to the state will not
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
need to continuously review nor
 
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
retroactively review current Investments
 
02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's only going forward if somebody
 
02:21:13.490 --> 02:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
brings forward a concern about an
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
investment that they're looking at doing
 
02:21:18.530 --> 02:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
then the state would investigate it
 
02:21:20.510 --> 02:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
so it would take
 
02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
a party actually complaining that they
 
02:21:24.650 --> 02:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
believe the company is involved in BDS
 
02:21:26.990 --> 02:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
for the state to have to investigate
 
02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:27.830 align:start position:0%
for the state to have to investigate
that

02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're not telling the state to do these
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
investigations on everybody everything
 
02:21:35.809 --> 02:21:35.819 align:start position:0%
and and those retroactive ones that have
 
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
been in place for years
 
02:21:40.190 --> 02:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
35 states have already adopted these
 
02:21:41.450 --> 02:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws with
 
02:21:43.250 --> 02:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
overwhelming success demonstrated in
 
02:21:45.469 --> 02:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
their implementation and enforcement
 
02:21:47.210 --> 02:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
the US government has emphatically
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
rejected boycotts based on national
 
02:21:51.349 --> 02:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
origin and interferences with foreign
 
02:21:53.929 --> 02:21:53.939 align:start position:0%
trade policy in general Congress has
 
02:21:55.790 --> 02:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
legislated against boycotts of Israel
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
for four decades
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
and federal courts have ruled that
 
02:22:01.790 --> 02:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
economic boycotts in general are not
 
02:22:04.250 --> 02:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
protected free speech in particular the
 
02:22:07.490 --> 02:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
export Administration Act of 1977 and
 
02:22:09.590 --> 02:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
the ribikov amendment to the tax reform
 
02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
Act of 1976 were both explicitly
 
02:22:14.330 --> 02:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
designed to combat the Arab League's
 
02:22:16.370 --> 02:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
boycott of Israel which extends to the
 
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
secondary and tertiary boycotts of firms
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
doing business with Israel
 
02:22:22.849 --> 02:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
Federal Court decisions applying the
 
02:22:24.290 --> 02:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
statutes have ruled that they do not
 
02:22:26.690 --> 02:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
violate First Amendment because economic
 
02:22:29.330 --> 02:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
boycotts are not protected speech but
 
02:22:30.770 --> 02:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
are instead a form of commercial
 
02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:32.570 align:start position:0%
are instead a form of commercial
activity

02:22:32.570 --> 02:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
activity
 
02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
the United States government continues
 
02:22:35.929 --> 02:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
to monitor these efforts through the
 
02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Commerce office of
 
02:22:40.910 --> 02:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
anti-boycott compliance which is the OAC
 
02:22:42.410 --> 02:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
there's other countries that are also
 
02:22:45.050 --> 02:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
oppose these boycotts of Israel and any
 
02:22:46.969 --> 02:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
boycott in general of national origin
 
02:22:49.610 --> 02:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
discrimination in October of 2015 the
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court of France ruled that the
 
02:22:53.150 --> 02:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
BDS movement's actions demonstrate an
 
02:22:55.370 --> 02:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
attempt to discriminate against a
 
02:22:57.650 --> 02:22:57.660 align:start position:0%
particular country in this case Israel
 
02:22:59.510 --> 02:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
the ruling was based on France's law
 
02:23:01.070 --> 02:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with freedom of the press which
 
02:23:02.570 --> 02:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
forbids discrimination hatred or
 
02:23:03.950 --> 02:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
violence toward a person or group of
 
02:23:06.410 --> 02:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
people grounds of their origin their
 
02:23:08.210 --> 02:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
belonging or not belonging to an ethnic
 
02:23:09.950 --> 02:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
group a nation a race or a certain
 
02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:11.990 align:start position:0%
group a nation a race or a certain
religion

02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
religion
 
02:23:15.050 --> 02:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
in passing HB 339
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
you would demonstrate it's the New
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature's willingness to
 
02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
forego business opportunities with
 
02:23:23.210 --> 02:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
parties who's discriminatory commercial
 
02:23:25.849 --> 02:23:25.859 align:start position:0%
practices make them otherwise unfit for
 
02:23:27.530 --> 02:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
dealings with the state
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
and in exchange we Safeguard New
 
02:23:31.010 --> 02:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's precious trade opportunities
 
02:23:32.690 --> 02:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
with a country that's on The Cutting
 
02:23:35.690 --> 02:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
Edge in every sector 85 companies listed
 
02:23:37.370 --> 02:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
on the New York Stock Exchange and the
 
02:23:38.929 --> 02:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
third highest number of companies listed
 
02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
on the NASDAQ exchange after U.S and
 
02:23:41.399 --> 02:23:42.349 align:start position:0%
on the NASDAQ exchange after U.S and
China

02:23:42.349 --> 02:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
China
 
02:23:43.610 --> 02:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
the bill protects New Hampshire
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
companies from interference and
 
02:23:47.690 --> 02:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
discriminatory boycotts as much as it
 
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
protects their Israeli trade partners
 
02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
this bill's protecting New Hampshire's
 
02:23:54.830 --> 02:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
right to free trade with Israel the
 
02:23:56.570 --> 02:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
trade directly benefits our state's
 
02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
entire economy and the quality of life
 
02:24:00.410 --> 02:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
of all of our citizens
 
02:24:03.770 --> 02:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
it encompasses many vital sectors Israel
 
02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:06.180 align:start position:0%
is currently leading in Health Sciences
 
02:24:07.969 --> 02:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and water
 
02:24:10.849 --> 02:24:10.859 align:start position:0%
energy all areas of tech and research
 
02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
and development and as of 2021 Israel
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
was the 14th biggest trading partner
 
02:24:17.090 --> 02:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire
 
02:24:18.770 --> 02:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
the trade was valued in billions of
 
02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:20.210 align:start position:0%
the trade was valued in billions of
dollars

02:24:20.210 --> 02:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:24:22.130 --> 02:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to answer any
 
02:24:23.330 --> 02:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
questions although there are others
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
speaking behind me who may be better
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
suited to uh answer specifics yes I
 
02:24:30.410 --> 02:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
think we will try to keep our questions
 
02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:31.670 align:start position:0%
think we will try to keep our questions
down

02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:24:33.710 --> 02:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
we've had similar bills so we should be
 
02:24:35.929 --> 02:24:35.939 align:start position:0%
familiar with the concept
 
02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
speline are there any questions
 
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:58.809 --> 02:24:58.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:01.370 --> 02:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning
 
02:25:03.410 --> 02:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
colleagues my name is Jordan ullery of
 
02:25:06.410 --> 02:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 13 Hudson I'm Cedar and ways
 
02:25:08.090 --> 02:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
and means in this house
 
02:25:10.130 --> 02:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
it is my pleasure to speak on this
 
02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
important bill regarding the need to
 
02:25:13.790 --> 02:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
focus upon the revenues and our pension
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
systems some of you are aware patients
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
pension systems across the nature Nation
 
02:25:22.010 --> 02:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
are in danger of collapse New Hampshire
 
02:25:23.690 --> 02:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
is no exception
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
some of the reasons include the federal
 
02:25:27.710 --> 02:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
government's Gatsby standards which
 
02:25:30.650 --> 02:25:30.660 align:start position:0%
radically change changed our system from
 
02:25:33.290 --> 02:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
pay as you go to pay into a fund first
 
02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's oversimplified but it's a good
 
02:25:38.650 --> 02:25:38.660 align:start position:0%
start to describe it another is
 
02:25:41.330 --> 02:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
ill-advised can risky risky investment
 
02:25:44.150 --> 02:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
in feel good or what I like to call
 
02:25:47.150 --> 02:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
solyndra type Investments the latter is
 
02:25:49.610 --> 02:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
rapidly developing into a source of
 
02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:50.929 align:start position:0%
rapidly developing into a source of
concern

02:25:50.929 --> 02:25:50.939 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
as a fiduciary responsibility to the
 
02:25:57.770 --> 02:25:57.780 align:start position:0%
employee seems to be being set aside in
 
02:26:00.770 --> 02:26:00.780 align:start position:0%
favor of some very harmful Investments
 
02:26:04.250 --> 02:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
or non-investments as a case may be
 
02:26:06.170 --> 02:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
as one can see from the fiscal note
 
02:26:07.849 --> 02:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
attached there is an indeterminable
 
02:26:10.670 --> 02:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
effect upon this bill as it does not
 
02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
prevent investment to accumulate Revenue
 
02:26:16.510 --> 02:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
rather this bill prevents non-investment
 
02:26:20.210 --> 02:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
divestiture or boycotting of Revenue
 
02:26:20.220 --> 02:26:22.910 align:start position:0%

generation
 
02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
that is abrogating the fiduciary
 
02:26:28.309 --> 02:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility to fund things including
 
02:26:31.730 --> 02:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
retire our retirement accounts even the
 
02:26:34.130 --> 02:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
U.S Judiciary is noted that the primary
 
02:26:36.650 --> 02:26:36.660 align:start position:0%
goal of investing by government in an
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
entity is a responsibility to the
 
02:26:43.309 --> 02:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
recipients of the revenue it's not a
 
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
form of social action
 
02:26:48.290 --> 02:26:48.300 align:start position:0%
BDS actions endanger the residents of
 
02:26:50.050 --> 02:26:50.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire by unfairly and
 
02:26:53.150 --> 02:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
deleteriously restricting the ability of
 
02:26:56.030 --> 02:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
an investment to produce revenue for
 
02:26:56.040 --> 02:26:57.469 align:start position:0%

investors
 
02:26:59.330 --> 02:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the trading partner
 
02:27:02.450 --> 02:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
with Israeli companies to the tune of as
 
02:27:04.849 --> 02:27:04.859 align:start position:0%
was stated earlier but billions
 
02:27:06.670 --> 02:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
some of this is in Joint Defense
 
02:27:09.950 --> 02:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
Ventures some in education some in
 
02:27:12.170 --> 02:27:12.180 align:start position:0%
Environmental Research some in medical
 
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
devices we see the benefits of this
 
02:27:16.849 --> 02:27:16.859 align:start position:0%
Revenue generation when we did our
 
02:27:18.290 --> 02:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
budget estimates
 
02:27:21.710 --> 02:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
UNH and Dartmouth both receive hundreds
 
02:27:23.570 --> 02:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars in educational
 
02:27:26.510 --> 02:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
grants that provide for professors and
 
02:27:28.730 --> 02:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
produce outstanding results in
 
02:27:31.610 --> 02:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
agriculture or core research one only
 
02:27:33.410 --> 02:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
needs to take a look at what has
 
02:27:35.630 --> 02:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
happened in the Negev Desert to see how
 
02:27:38.750 --> 02:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
the benefit of Agriculture takes place
 
02:27:41.270 --> 02:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
several businesses such as but not
 
02:27:44.330 --> 02:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
limited to Mill power L3 Communications
 
02:27:48.349 --> 02:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
and over in Portsmouth sponged yet these
 
02:27:50.590 --> 02:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
are direct recipients of the trade
 
02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
relationship between Israel and New
 
02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:53.809 align:start position:0%
relationship between Israel and New

02:27:53.809 --> 02:27:53.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:27:55.910 --> 02:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
a BDS scheme would put your neighbors
 
02:27:59.150 --> 02:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
out of work quite literally in addition
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
there are hundreds of employees
 
02:28:03.170 --> 02:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
available in Merrimack which works
 
02:28:05.570 --> 02:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
closely with other defense Industries
 
02:28:08.830 --> 02:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
small and large here in New Hampshire
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
elimination of jobs through a boycott
 
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
would reduce tax revenues to New
 
02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire through
 
02:28:18.230 --> 02:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
reduced betbpt
 
02:28:20.750 --> 02:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
and of course the secondary effect would
 
02:28:22.969 --> 02:28:22.979 align:start position:0%
be people leaving New Hampshire so you'd
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
have the property taxes and then the
 
02:28:27.650 --> 02:28:27.660 align:start position:0%
accumulation defect there
 
02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
this bill protects New Hampshire
 
02:28:34.010 --> 02:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
residents from the demonstrably bad and
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
risky even risky Investments directly
 
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
affecting our Pension funds and our
 
02:28:41.929 --> 02:28:41.939 align:start position:0%
employees it is very likely
 
02:28:44.270 --> 02:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
that the BDS and Investments run
 
02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
contrary to both the New Hampshire and
 
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
the U.S constitutional restrictions on
 
02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:50.450 align:start position:0%
the U.S constitutional restrictions on
discrimination

02:28:50.450 --> 02:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
02:28:52.670 --> 02:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
it is seemingly obvious that BDS
 
02:28:55.849 --> 02:28:55.859 align:start position:0%
policies as a whole violated a host of
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
international treaties and Norms against
 
02:28:58.080 --> 02:28:59.929 align:start position:0%
international treaties and Norms against
discrimination

02:28:59.929 --> 02:28:59.939 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
02:29:03.349 --> 02:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
this bill merely but clearly states that
 
02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
one will not engage in systemic
 
02:29:08.570 --> 02:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
discrimination rather that they must
 
02:29:11.330 --> 02:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
focus on the fiduciary responsibility to
 
02:29:13.849 --> 02:29:13.859 align:start position:0%
ensure the best possible return
 
02:29:17.570 --> 02:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
and fund growth for our workers nothing
 
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
in the spilled demands investment in a
 
02:29:22.010 --> 02:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
specific company nor companies from any
 
02:29:23.630 --> 02:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
region in the world
 
02:29:25.809 --> 02:29:25.819 align:start position:0%
neither does this bill prevent
 
02:29:28.969 --> 02:29:28.979 align:start position:0%
investments in whatever company except
 
02:29:32.270 --> 02:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
is specified this all this bill does is
 
02:29:35.389 --> 02:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
clearly state that a systemic method of
 
02:29:37.730 --> 02:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
discrimination is antithetical to the
 
02:29:40.429 --> 02:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
principle of equal treatment and smacks
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
of the worst possible form of racism
 
02:29:46.510 --> 02:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
racism namely government sanctioned
 
02:29:50.210 --> 02:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
discrimination based upon race or Creed
 
02:29:53.090 --> 02:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
or place of national origin
 
02:29:55.490 --> 02:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
the investment fund is in Oregon is an
 
02:29:57.889 --> 02:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
organ of state government and needs to
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
comply with both its fiscal
 
02:30:02.389 --> 02:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and state law to ensure
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
the best possible Investments for our
 
02:30:06.830 --> 02:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
pension fund for our state employees
 
02:30:09.530 --> 02:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
that is why this bill is needed that is
 
02:30:11.570 --> 02:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
why I support the effort
 
02:30:14.270 --> 02:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention oh answer
 
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:30:18.650 --> 02:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
if you haven't are there uh specific
 
02:30:21.889 --> 02:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gerhard thank
 
02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
02:30:25.250 --> 02:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
so receive some emails about this
 
02:30:26.990 --> 02:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
legislation and one of them came from
 
02:30:29.210 --> 02:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
the Rachel Corey foundation so she was
 
02:30:31.429 --> 02:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
killed on March 16th in 2003 by in
 
02:30:33.950 --> 02:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
Israel excuse me representative Gerhard
 
02:30:36.349 --> 02:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
we are not going to debate whether
 
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
Israel is worthy we're going to
 
02:30:40.250 --> 02:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
concentrate on the details of the bill
 
02:30:43.610 --> 02:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:46.010 --> 02:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
not no not about the situation of her
 
02:30:47.809 --> 02:30:47.819 align:start position:0%
death but I'm addressing the email where
 
02:30:48.889 --> 02:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
they're talking about this law being
 
02:30:50.990 --> 02:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
struck down in Arizona it's pertinent
 
02:30:54.050 --> 02:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I hope hope that is the
 
02:30:56.570 --> 02:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
case Okay so she was killed in 2003 so
 
02:30:58.309 --> 02:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
he formed a foundation and they write in
 
02:30:59.630 --> 02:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
their letter that
 
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
in blocking Arizona's 2016 anti-boycott
 
02:31:03.710 --> 02:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
law District Court Federal District
 
02:31:05.570 --> 02:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
Court stated that a restriction of one's
 
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
ability to participate in Collective
 
02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
calls to oppose Israel unquestionably
 
02:31:10.429 --> 02:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
burden is the protected expression of
 
02:31:12.050 --> 02:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
companies wishing to engage in such a
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
boycott the type of collective action
 
02:31:16.250 --> 02:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
Collective action targeted by the
 
02:31:18.170 --> 02:31:18.180 align:start position:0%
Arizona law specifically implicates the
 
02:31:19.790 --> 02:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
rights of assembly and Association that
 
02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
Americans and arizonans use to bring
 
02:31:23.929 --> 02:31:23.939 align:start position:0%
about political social and economic
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
change has that been overruled or is
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
that still good law I mean that's
 
02:31:31.030 --> 02:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
actually yes it was overturned to
 
02:31:34.429 --> 02:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
representative but my comment on that
 
02:31:36.170 --> 02:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
would be number one this is not the
 
02:31:37.790 --> 02:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
Arizona law this is different than the
 
02:31:40.070 --> 02:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
Arizona law number two fiduciary
 
02:31:43.130 --> 02:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
responsibility is substantially separate
 
02:31:46.309 --> 02:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
from social action if a company wants to
 
02:31:48.110 --> 02:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
engage in Social actions they're
 
02:31:50.929 --> 02:31:50.939 align:start position:0%
perfectly well capable of doing that on
 
02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
their own
 
02:31:54.050 --> 02:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
but they just can't
 
02:31:56.750 --> 02:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
have as a policy of discrimination
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
against a specific individual they can
 
02:32:02.570 --> 02:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
avoid they can say in their publication
 
02:32:06.290 --> 02:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
we try not to but the primary goal has
 
02:32:09.110 --> 02:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
got to be the fiscal responsibility that
 
02:32:12.650 --> 02:32:12.660 align:start position:0%
they owe to their investors not to
 
02:32:15.230 --> 02:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
a social action group that may or may
 
02:32:17.450 --> 02:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
not have any responsibility to anyone
 
02:32:19.429 --> 02:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
other than themselves
 
02:32:21.770 --> 02:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:32:23.450 --> 02:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
02:32:25.270 --> 02:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative uluri thank you man
 
02:32:34.969 --> 02:32:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:37.790 --> 02:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm going to be brief and for
 
02:32:39.650 --> 02:32:39.660 align:start position:0%
the record I'm representative Judy Aaron
 
02:32:42.349 --> 02:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
representative representing Sullivan
 
02:32:44.330 --> 02:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
County District 4 which is Acworth
 
02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:51.290 --> 02:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
most of you know me as a staunch
 
02:32:54.050 --> 02:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
supporter of Israel and a Jewish a
 
02:32:56.210 --> 02:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
person of the Jewish faith
 
02:32:59.090 --> 02:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
I come here today in opposition to this
 
02:32:59.100 --> 02:33:00.650 align:start position:0%
I come here today in opposition to this
bill

02:33:00.650 --> 02:33:00.660 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
and it's not because I support any of
 
02:33:05.929 --> 02:33:05.939 align:start position:0%
these companies that deal with BDS
 
02:33:05.939 --> 02:33:07.670 align:start position:0%
these companies that deal with BDS
activity

02:33:07.670 --> 02:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
activity
 
02:33:11.570 --> 02:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
but I really truly believe that our
 
02:33:16.490 --> 02:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
investment team here for our state
 
02:33:20.030 --> 02:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
that political policy shouldn't be
 
02:33:22.490 --> 02:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
interfering with their investment
 
02:33:22.500 --> 02:33:24.170 align:start position:0%
interfering with their investment
strategies

02:33:24.170 --> 02:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
strategies
 
02:33:26.469 --> 02:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
our investment team should be using
 
02:33:29.929 --> 02:33:29.939 align:start position:0%
investment criteria in order to be
 
02:33:31.910 --> 02:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
making the decisions that they make on a
 
02:33:33.770 --> 02:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
daily basis
 
02:33:37.130 --> 02:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
if BDS supporting companies are a bad
 
02:33:37.140 --> 02:33:38.770 align:start position:0%
if BDS supporting companies are a bad
investment

02:33:38.770 --> 02:33:38.780 align:start position:0%
investment
 
02:33:41.870 --> 02:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
then they won't be investing in them and
 
02:33:44.030 --> 02:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
for the most part I'm sure maybe these
 
02:33:47.030 --> 02:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
companies are bad Investments
 
02:33:50.150 --> 02:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
so I really think that while this bill
 
02:33:52.969 --> 02:33:52.979 align:start position:0%
is well intentioned just as similar
 
02:33:55.910 --> 02:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
bills have come before you with regard
 
02:33:59.809 --> 02:33:59.819 align:start position:0%
to not investing in companies from China
 
02:33:59.819 --> 02:34:00.710 align:start position:0%
to not investing in companies from China
um

02:34:00.710 --> 02:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:03.530 --> 02:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
I think that this is a well-intentioned
 
02:34:03.540 --> 02:34:04.370 align:start position:0%
I think that this is a well-intentioned
bill

02:34:04.370 --> 02:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:34:06.889 --> 02:34:06.899 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that it's something
 
02:34:09.770 --> 02:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
that we should start going down that
 
02:34:11.929 --> 02:34:11.939 align:start position:0%
road of dictating to our investment
 
02:34:11.939 --> 02:34:13.030 align:start position:0%
road of dictating to our investment
teams

02:34:13.030 --> 02:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
teams
 
02:34:15.469 --> 02:34:15.479 align:start position:0%
what they should and shouldn't invest in
 
02:34:18.530 --> 02:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
and that's what I have to say today all
 
02:34:20.030 --> 02:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
right thank you representative Aaron are
 
02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
there questions
 
02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
well I believe that was clear enough all
 
02:34:35.630 --> 02:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:37.730 --> 02:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair uh I'm
 
02:34:40.010 --> 02:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards representing
 
02:34:43.070 --> 02:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 31.
 
02:34:46.670 --> 02:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
um I uh I'm here in support of uh the
 
02:34:49.730 --> 02:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
bill today I I'm a co-sponsor I have
 
02:34:51.770 --> 02:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
four points I'd like to make and try to
 
02:34:54.110 --> 02:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
keep it under four minutes
 
02:34:56.929 --> 02:34:56.939 align:start position:0%
um first of all uh I you know I hope the
 
02:34:59.389 --> 02:34:59.399 align:start position:0%
provisions should this bill pass into
 
02:35:02.090 --> 02:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
law it's my hope that the provisions are
 
02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
actually never needed or requiring to be
 
02:35:08.690 --> 02:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
required to be enforced and uh and
 
02:35:12.290 --> 02:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
that's because I think ultimately I
 
02:35:17.150 --> 02:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
would want and wish for our invest our
 
02:35:19.990 --> 02:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
investment Community to
 
02:35:23.270 --> 02:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
do what it has done for a hundred years
 
02:35:25.730 --> 02:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
and that is to put the priority of their
 
02:35:27.849 --> 02:35:27.859 align:start position:0%
investments into their fiduciary
 
02:35:30.290 --> 02:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
responsibility their fiduciary
 
02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to the individual
 
02:35:34.670 --> 02:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
investor they are supposed to make
 
02:35:37.730 --> 02:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
decisions that maximize their return
 
02:35:40.010 --> 02:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about the state
 
02:35:43.130 --> 02:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
pension fund for example we need them to
 
02:35:45.050 --> 02:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
make money so that we don't have to use
 
02:35:48.770 --> 02:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
tax money to backfill any any loss so I
 
02:35:51.230 --> 02:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
I want the focus to be on fiduciary
 
02:35:55.389 --> 02:35:55.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility I I think that this bill
 
02:35:59.389 --> 02:35:59.399 align:start position:0%
is asking for our society to be more
 
02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
tolerant and more inclusive we have laws
 
02:36:05.389 --> 02:36:05.399 align:start position:0%
all over our books that bar
 
02:36:09.050 --> 02:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
discrimination this is another I think
 
02:36:13.730 --> 02:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
in a long line of efforts for us to to
 
02:36:16.210 --> 02:36:16.220 align:start position:0%
avoid explicit
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
discriminatory practices and this the
 
02:36:21.830 --> 02:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
the Discrimination aspect here is pretty
 
02:36:24.889 --> 02:36:24.899 align:start position:0%
obvious when people ask me what I think
 
02:36:28.070 --> 02:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
about investing in companies with ESG
 
02:36:30.830 --> 02:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
policies and why I might oppose them
 
02:36:32.389 --> 02:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
while supporting this bill
 
02:36:34.969 --> 02:36:34.979 align:start position:0%
simultaneously I I would say it's
 
02:36:37.790 --> 02:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
because uh the the the principle the
 
02:36:40.490 --> 02:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
theme Here is consistent is that we want
 
02:36:42.770 --> 02:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
to have the people who make our
 
02:36:45.230 --> 02:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
investment decisions be able to have the
 
02:36:48.650 --> 02:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
flexibility to be inclusive and focused
 
02:36:52.250 --> 02:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
on their fiduciary duty above sort of
 
02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:01.309 --> 02:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
I in my past was a product manager and I
 
02:37:04.370 --> 02:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
worked for Eastman Kodak we had a
 
02:37:07.490 --> 02:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
business partner in Rana Israel just
 
02:37:09.469 --> 02:37:09.479 align:start position:0%
outside of Tel Aviv knit company named
 
02:37:14.510 --> 02:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
alga Tech and alga Tech was a kind of a
 
02:37:18.590 --> 02:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
premier tech technology company dealing
 
02:37:21.469 --> 02:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
with medical imaging systems and
 
02:37:23.809 --> 02:37:23.819 align:start position:0%
initially when I took that role I was
 
02:37:26.270 --> 02:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
considered that a concerned that the
 
02:37:28.730 --> 02:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
Middle East was kind of off limits to us
 
02:37:31.309 --> 02:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
from a marketing perspective but I was
 
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
very happy to see over the years of in
 
02:37:38.270 --> 02:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
that role that the um the many of the
 
02:37:40.370 --> 02:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
Muslim nations had taken a look the
 
02:37:42.290 --> 02:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
other way approach to the fact that we
 
02:37:44.809 --> 02:37:44.819 align:start position:0%
marketed an Israeli product within our
 
02:37:47.510 --> 02:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
our solution set and we closed an
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
enormous deal in Saudi Arabia with the
 
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
King Fahad hospital that required a lot
 
02:37:57.889 --> 02:37:57.899 align:start position:0%
of cooperation in the sen of Israeli
 
02:38:00.830 --> 02:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
Engineers to into Saudi Arabia to work
 
02:38:04.610 --> 02:38:04.620 align:start position:0%
with with their counterparts and I found
 
02:38:08.690 --> 02:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
that to be a very hopeful sign that our
 
02:38:11.389 --> 02:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
global system of Commerce was actually
 
02:38:14.270 --> 02:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
working to the benefit of mankind by
 
02:38:17.210 --> 02:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
incentivizing a tolerance and acceptance
 
02:38:22.550 --> 02:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
of others and I I I'm I'm not I so I'll
 
02:38:25.969 --> 02:38:25.979 align:start position:0%
stop there and just say uh I I my
 
02:38:28.429 --> 02:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
emphasis on this bill would would want
 
02:38:31.490 --> 02:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
to be more positive than negative I
 
02:38:33.050 --> 02:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
don't really like the fact that we're
 
02:38:34.990 --> 02:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
saying we're prohibiting certain things
 
02:38:38.290 --> 02:38:38.300 align:start position:0%
but I but I am very much in favor of us
 
02:38:41.469 --> 02:38:41.479 align:start position:0%
encouraging certain socially redeemable
 
02:39:01.550 --> 02:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:03.530 --> 02:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the record my

02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
as the testimony provided a few weeks
 
02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
ago for House Bill 457 I'm not going to
 
02:39:23.929 --> 02:39:23.939 align:start position:0%
waste your time by reading that today it
 
02:39:26.270 --> 02:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
just it expresses a general concern
 
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
about any sort of legislation that would
 
02:39:34.849 --> 02:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
um limit the investment Horizon of nhrs
 
02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
in order to meet its fiduciary duty to
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
act in the best interests of members at

um you know regardless of how
 
02:39:43.849 --> 02:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned uh any piece of
 
02:39:45.950 --> 02:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
legislation is
 
02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:47.570 align:start position:0%
legislation is
um

02:39:47.570 --> 02:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:49.969 --> 02:39:49.979 align:start position:0%
creating that precedent opens the door
 
02:39:51.710 --> 02:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
for future
 
02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:52.990 align:start position:0%
for future
um

02:39:52.990 --> 02:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:55.370 --> 02:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
legislative enactments this is a purple
 
02:39:57.050 --> 02:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
state things could you know we could be
 
02:39:58.670 --> 02:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
looking at a bill in two to four years
 
02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
about divesting from fossil fuels things
 
02:40:02.809 --> 02:40:02.819 align:start position:0%
like that where you know anything that
 
02:40:06.050 --> 02:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
that limits our investment folks ability
 
02:40:06.060 --> 02:40:07.429 align:start position:0%
that limits our investment folks ability
to

02:40:07.429 --> 02:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
you know look at the landscape and try
 
02:40:12.170 --> 02:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
to find you know the best return on our
 
02:40:14.450 --> 02:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
assets for for the benefit of our
 
02:40:16.490 --> 02:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
members a couple of the speakers Did
 
02:40:20.090 --> 02:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
speak to fiduciary duty uh earlier and
 
02:40:21.969 --> 02:40:21.979 align:start position:0%
um I will
 
02:40:23.929 --> 02:40:23.939 align:start position:0%
reiterate there
 
02:40:25.370 --> 02:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
um you know their statement that you
 
02:40:27.530 --> 02:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
know our sole duty is to the membership
 
02:40:31.130 --> 02:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
as fiduciary so the even the
 
02:40:33.290 --> 02:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
undercurrent existing state and federal
 
02:40:35.929 --> 02:40:35.939 align:start position:0%
law we don't see any
 
02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
possibility or any any room for our
 
02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:39.770 align:start position:0%
possibility or any any room for our
investment

02:40:39.770 --> 02:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
investment
 
02:40:43.250 --> 02:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
committee or investment managers to put
 
02:40:45.710 --> 02:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
other factors above
 
02:40:48.530 --> 02:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
you know producing income so what I'm
 
02:40:51.230 --> 02:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
saying is we you know we wouldn't you
 
02:40:52.730 --> 02:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
know invest
 
02:40:55.070 --> 02:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
um you know for purely social or
 
02:40:58.010 --> 02:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
political gain already so I just wanted
 
02:40:59.570 --> 02:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
to establish that as well and I'll be
 
02:41:03.410 --> 02:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:05.630 --> 02:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
oh thank you I think we remember the
 
02:41:07.309 --> 02:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
last one
 
02:41:09.170 --> 02:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
02:41:16.849 --> 02:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:18.710 --> 02:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman members of the
 
02:41:20.809 --> 02:41:20.819 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Craig Downing I'm
 
02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the Deferred
 
02:41:24.830 --> 02:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
Compensation Plan and commission which
 
02:41:27.230 --> 02:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
oversees the plan it is a voluntary
 
02:41:29.330 --> 02:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
supplemental retirement plan serving
 
02:41:32.210 --> 02:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
state employees and members of 65
 
02:41:34.490 --> 02:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions
 
02:41:39.010 --> 02:41:39.020 align:start position:0%
um I wrote the fiscal note and uh I can
 
02:41:43.309 --> 02:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
that's a the fiscal known as written and
 
02:41:46.610 --> 02:41:46.620 align:start position:0%
explained uh I do agree
 
02:41:49.429 --> 02:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
um there would be no cost
 
02:41:51.950 --> 02:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
um other than the general you know we
 
02:41:53.690 --> 02:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
have the same fiduciary rules as the
 
02:41:56.330 --> 02:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
pension and any investment advisor we
 
02:41:58.610 --> 02:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
have to choose by The Prudent investment
 
02:42:02.090 --> 02:42:02.100 align:start position:0%
rule Investments for the sole benefit of
 
02:42:04.010 --> 02:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
those members and their beneficiaries
 
02:42:08.030 --> 02:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
again restrictions on that can place a
 
02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:10.130 align:start position:0%
again restrictions on that can place a
problem

02:42:10.130 --> 02:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:42:12.889 --> 02:42:12.899 align:start position:0%
the commission really doesn't get down
 
02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
and do individual companies
 
02:42:19.070 --> 02:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
but in a in a review of for this
 
02:42:21.349 --> 02:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
legislation there's a there's a couple
 
02:42:23.330 --> 02:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
companies in Europe that would fit the
 
02:42:23.340 --> 02:42:24.349 align:start position:0%
companies in Europe that would fit the
bill

02:42:24.349 --> 02:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:42:26.349 --> 02:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
one of them is very large
 
02:42:28.910 --> 02:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
and the companies I use here are
 
02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:30.590 align:start position:0%
and the companies I use here are
examples

02:42:30.590 --> 02:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
examples
 
02:42:30.600 --> 02:42:32.210 align:start position:0%
examples
um

02:42:32.210 --> 02:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm us I'm assured that it is in
 
02:42:39.650 --> 02:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
an index so we have an index for
 
02:42:43.250 --> 02:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
international funds there's Global funds
 
02:42:45.650 --> 02:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
mutual funds which hold a variety of
 
02:42:48.290 --> 02:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
Assets in and outside the country and
 
02:42:49.910 --> 02:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sure this company is big enough to
 
02:42:51.290 --> 02:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
be in there
 
02:42:54.650 --> 02:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
my reading of the bill shows me that if
 
02:42:57.170 --> 02:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
we have the Vanguard international Index
 
02:42:57.180 --> 02:42:58.309 align:start position:0%
we have the Vanguard international Index
Fund

02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
Fund
 
02:43:00.889 --> 02:43:00.899 align:start position:0%
and it holds this company
 
02:43:04.670 --> 02:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
that that is fine it is
 
02:43:07.010 --> 02:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
my Marine and the bill is if the company
 
02:43:10.849 --> 02:43:10.859 align:start position:0%
itself and just using the you know
 
02:43:12.530 --> 02:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
company X in the United States
 
02:43:14.990 --> 02:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
international fund
 
02:43:16.490 --> 02:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
um if they
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
are against Israel then that would be a
 
02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:21.889 align:start position:0%
are against Israel then that would be a
problem

02:43:21.889 --> 02:43:21.899 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:43:24.349 --> 02:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
um I and then I'm relieved to know that
 
02:43:26.389 --> 02:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
we we can't we don't have to go back
 
02:43:28.250 --> 02:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
retroactively so that means that there
 
02:43:30.110 --> 02:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
would be no changes of our current
 
02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:31.429 align:start position:0%
would be no changes of our current
Investments

02:43:31.429 --> 02:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
02:43:33.290 --> 02:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
in the plan
 
02:43:36.410 --> 02:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions
 
02:43:37.910 --> 02:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:40.670 --> 02:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
I think don't see any questions thank
 
02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:41.510 align:start position:0%
I think don't see any questions thank
you

02:43:41.510 --> 02:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:43:59.809 --> 02:43:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:59.819 --> 02:44:01.010 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:44:01.010 --> 02:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:44:03.410 --> 02:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and committee members it's
 
02:44:05.270 --> 02:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
an honor and a pleasure to be here and
 
02:44:08.690 --> 02:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
to see so many friends my name is Paul
 
02:44:12.950 --> 02:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
Birch I am a former State Rep I reside
 
02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:14.410 align:start position:0%
Birch I am a former State Rep I reside
in

02:44:14.410 --> 02:44:14.420 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:44:16.990 --> 02:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
Westmoreland New Hampshire
 
02:44:21.610 --> 02:44:21.620 align:start position:0%
and I'm here on behalf of myself
 
02:44:25.490 --> 02:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
which feels different I'd like to take a
 
02:44:28.130 --> 02:44:28.140 align:start position:0%
few minutes just to talk about the legal
 
02:44:32.030 --> 02:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
underpinnings of HB 339 and I had your
 
02:44:34.910 --> 02:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
comment in mind and to clarify Beyond
 
02:44:36.349 --> 02:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable question that this
 
02:44:39.770 --> 02:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
legislation is fully constitutional is
 
02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
not an impermissible infringement on the
 
02:44:44.750 --> 02:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
First Amendment at the onset nothing I
 
02:44:47.270 --> 02:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
say here should be construed as legal
 
02:44:50.090 --> 02:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
advice that you have to pay for
 
02:44:53.090 --> 02:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
the legality of this legislation is
 
02:44:55.849 --> 02:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
based upon two core principles first
 
02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
that HB 339 seeks to protect the
 
02:45:02.750 --> 02:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
economic health of the State of New
 
02:45:06.170 --> 02:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and its citizen investors and
 
02:45:06.180 --> 02:45:07.070 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and its citizen investors and
two

02:45:07.070 --> 02:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
that no company can force the state of
 
02:45:12.530 --> 02:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to act in a discriminatory
 
02:45:12.540 --> 02:45:13.670 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to act in a discriminatory
manner

02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
manner
 
02:45:15.650 --> 02:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
both principles have been routinely
 
02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
upheld by the courts up to and including
 
02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court
 
02:45:24.349 --> 02:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
economic expression
 
02:45:27.770 --> 02:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
economic conduct is not expression and
 
02:45:29.210 --> 02:45:29.220 align:start position:0%
the fact that it may have political
 
02:45:31.849 --> 02:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
motivation doesn't make it expression
 
02:45:35.510 --> 02:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's why states can and often do ban
 
02:45:38.330 --> 02:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
refusals to do business solely because
 
02:45:41.270 --> 02:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
of an individual's race national origin
 
02:45:43.790 --> 02:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
religious affiliation or other status
 
02:45:46.849 --> 02:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
even if accompanied by speech
 
02:45:48.429 --> 02:45:48.439 align:start position:0%
this is fundamental to our
 
02:45:52.370 --> 02:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws again acts may
 
02:45:55.190 --> 02:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
have a political motivation but that
 
02:45:58.490 --> 02:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily protect those Acts
 
02:46:02.270 --> 02:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
and to be clear this proposed Bill only
 
02:46:04.969 --> 02:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
covers economic conduct does not
 
02:46:07.370 --> 02:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
regulate speech of any kind
 
02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
parties who contract with the state
 
02:46:12.170 --> 02:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
remain free to express any view they
 
02:46:15.290 --> 02:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
please about Israel or any other topic
 
02:46:17.809 --> 02:46:17.819 align:start position:0%
so let me give you a few examples of the
 
02:46:22.130 --> 02:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
interaction perhaps of politics and uh
 
02:46:25.250 --> 02:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
and other factors I saw a case the other
 
02:46:27.650 --> 02:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
day where a person was arrested for
 
02:46:29.389 --> 02:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
blocking traffic and this person was
 
02:46:31.870 --> 02:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
holding a political sign
 
02:46:34.790 --> 02:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
and she said well this is my First
 
02:46:38.770 --> 02:46:38.780 align:start position:0%
Amendment right to express my opinion
 
02:46:42.410 --> 02:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
and as the courts determine it's not
 
02:46:44.210 --> 02:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
protected as the state has a strong
 
02:46:46.730 --> 02:46:46.740 align:start position:0%
reason to keep the road safe
 
02:46:49.130 --> 02:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
you may support Russia in the Russia
 
02:46:50.690 --> 02:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
Ukrainian War
 
02:46:53.030 --> 02:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
but you can't send military stuff to
 
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
Russia and claim it's protected by your
 
02:46:57.429 --> 02:46:57.439 align:start position:0%
First Amendment right
 
02:47:01.790 --> 02:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:04.010 --> 02:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
we hear around here from time to time
 
02:47:08.510 --> 02:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
that the phrase taxation is theft
 
02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
but failure to pay your taxes
 
02:47:14.510 --> 02:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
is not protected by claiming the First
 
02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment still have to pay your taxes
 
02:47:19.150 --> 02:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
whether you take a political stand
 
02:47:22.190 --> 02:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
against taxation or not
 
02:47:25.190 --> 02:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
the case Rumsfeld V Fair
 
02:47:28.610 --> 02:47:28.620 align:start position:0%
and this had to do with under a federal
 
02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
law Banning College recruiters military
 
02:47:34.790 --> 02:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
Recruiters on campus
 
02:47:38.870 --> 02:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
and it was said well they're banning
 
02:47:41.030 --> 02:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
them is expressing a First Amendment
 
02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:41.870 align:start position:0%
them is expressing a First Amendment
right

02:47:41.870 --> 02:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the U.S Supreme Court said no
 
02:47:47.090 --> 02:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
because it's not inherently expressive
 
02:47:50.150 --> 02:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to go back one more case
 
02:47:53.090 --> 02:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
way back when some of you or possibly of
 
02:47:56.929 --> 02:47:56.939 align:start position:0%
an age to remember uh when draft cards
 
02:47:58.809 --> 02:47:58.819 align:start position:0%
were burned
 
02:48:02.389 --> 02:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
and certainly was said
 
02:48:06.110 --> 02:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
I probably said it that burning the
 
02:48:09.429 --> 02:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
draft card is a politically
 
02:48:13.010 --> 02:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
expressive act protected by the First
 
02:48:13.020 --> 02:48:14.450 align:start position:0%
expressive act protected by the First
Amendment

02:48:14.450 --> 02:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:48:16.730 --> 02:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
and they went up to the Supreme Court
 
02:48:20.690 --> 02:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
U.S versus O'Brien and it set up a
 
02:48:23.929 --> 02:48:23.939 align:start position:0%
four-part test and I think this K this
 
02:48:26.990 --> 02:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
bill fills all four parts of the
 
02:48:29.090 --> 02:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
so-called O'Brien test
 
02:48:31.730 --> 02:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
is it within the Constitutional power of
 
02:48:33.290 --> 02:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
the government if the government
 
02:48:37.130 --> 02:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
regulation first is it it's Justified if
 
02:48:39.230 --> 02:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
it's within the Constitutional power of
 
02:48:41.870 --> 02:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
the government yes it furthers an
 
02:48:43.309 --> 02:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
important or substantial government
 
02:48:46.250 --> 02:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
interest yes the interests of the
 
02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
government is unrelated to the
 
02:48:51.530 --> 02:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
suppression of free expression and the
 
02:48:53.210 --> 02:48:53.220 align:start position:0%
incidental restriction on free
 
02:48:55.250 --> 02:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
expression is no greater than necessary
 
02:48:57.110 --> 02:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
to the furtherance of the government
 
02:49:00.110 --> 02:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
effort all of these are checked off in
 
02:49:02.030 --> 02:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
HB 339
 
02:49:04.490 --> 02:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
note the companies can say what they
 
02:49:08.090 --> 02:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
want they can petition Lobby carry signs
 
02:49:10.250 --> 02:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
they can participate in a boycott
 
02:49:13.309 --> 02:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
themselves if it's otherwise legal but
 
02:49:14.809 --> 02:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
it can't force the state of New
 
02:49:16.790 --> 02:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to abandon its
 
02:49:19.730 --> 02:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination policy or its policy
 
02:49:22.490 --> 02:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
to invest only in safe and prudent
 
02:49:22.500 --> 02:49:24.770 align:start position:0%
to invest only in safe and prudent
Investments

02:49:24.770 --> 02:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
02:49:26.929 --> 02:49:26.939 align:start position:0%
you may hear at some point I'm not sure
 
02:49:28.429 --> 02:49:28.439 align:start position:0%
who else is going to speak about a
 
02:49:31.070 --> 02:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
Clairborne Hardware case dealing with
 
02:49:34.190 --> 02:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
boycotts based on racial discrimination
 
02:49:36.590 --> 02:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court affirmed that rights
 
02:49:38.330 --> 02:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
to speak petition and assemble are
 
02:49:40.849 --> 02:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
protected by the First Amendment but it
 
02:49:43.809 --> 02:49:43.819 align:start position:0%
did not create a right to economically
 
02:49:46.450 --> 02:49:46.460 align:start position:0%
discriminate whenever the discriminator
 
02:49:50.330 --> 02:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
has a political motive in another case
 
02:49:52.730 --> 02:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
decided around the same time the
 
02:49:55.370 --> 02:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
international longshoreman's Case held
 
02:49:57.710 --> 02:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
at a prohibitional secondary boycotts
 
02:49:59.929 --> 02:49:59.939 align:start position:0%
could apply to politically motivated
 
02:50:03.770 --> 02:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
boycotts a secondary boycott or they're
 
02:50:05.330 --> 02:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
intended to pressure
 
02:50:07.610 --> 02:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
the Target and deceasing to do business
 
02:50:09.410 --> 02:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
with a third party
 
02:50:11.330 --> 02:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close
 
02:50:15.469 --> 02:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
basically with a case that's higher up
 
02:50:17.450 --> 02:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
than the
 
02:50:20.809 --> 02:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
Arizona case it's the the recent
 
02:50:24.170 --> 02:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
Arkansas times case just looked at by
 
02:50:27.050 --> 02:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court it's right now the
 
02:50:29.630 --> 02:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
highest Authority in the United States
 
02:50:33.050 --> 02:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
it's the uh only federal circuit court
 
02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
of appeals to rule and which the Supreme
 
02:50:38.929 --> 02:50:38.939 align:start position:0%
Court only a week or so ago unanimously
 
02:50:41.870 --> 02:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
it seems refused to consider overturning
 
02:50:43.730 --> 02:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
and this is the quote
 
02:50:47.690 --> 02:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
the legislative legislature's motive for
 
02:50:51.590 --> 02:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
passing acts 7 10 was primarily economic
 
02:50:55.010 --> 02:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
it repeatedly expressed concern for the
 
02:50:57.050 --> 02:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
commercial viability of companies that
 
02:50:59.690 --> 02:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
refused to do business with Israel and
 
02:51:01.250 --> 02:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
the effect this could have on the
 
02:51:03.050 --> 02:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
state's finances
 
02:51:07.070 --> 02:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
for example section blabla points out
 
02:51:09.950 --> 02:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
that companies that make discriminatory
 
02:51:12.830 --> 02:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
decisions on the basis of national
 
02:51:15.889 --> 02:51:15.899 align:start position:0%
origin and pair their commercial
 
02:51:15.899 --> 02:51:17.630 align:start position:0%
origin and pair their commercial
soundness

02:51:17.630 --> 02:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
soundness
 
02:51:20.990 --> 02:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
another section says these companies are
 
02:51:24.530 --> 02:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
unduly risky Contracting Partners or
 
02:51:26.990 --> 02:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles for investment because they
 
02:51:29.510 --> 02:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't have access to Israeli Innovations
 
02:51:31.630 --> 02:51:31.640 align:start position:0%
we've heard about some of that already
 
02:51:35.150 --> 02:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
these findings suggest suggest a purely
 
02:51:37.550 --> 02:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
commercial purpose for the statute and
 
02:51:39.590 --> 02:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
waste ways strongly in favor of
 
02:51:41.929 --> 02:51:41.939 align:start position:0%
upholding the statute the statute
 
02:51:43.330 --> 02:51:43.340 align:start position:0%
prohibits purely commercial
 
02:51:46.010 --> 02:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
non-expressive conduct it has not been
 
02:51:47.889 --> 02:51:47.899 align:start position:0%
Arkansas at times from publicly
 
02:51:50.510 --> 02:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
criticizing Israel or even protesting
 
02:51:52.969 --> 02:51:52.979 align:start position:0%
the statute itself it only prohibits
 
02:51:54.830 --> 02:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
economic decisions that discriminate
 
02:51:57.230 --> 02:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
against Israel
 
02:51:59.690 --> 02:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
finally the single leading academic
 
02:52:02.510 --> 02:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
study on this subject written by Josh
 
02:52:05.150 --> 02:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
Halpern a researcher at Harvard just
 
02:52:07.790 --> 02:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
came out about a week ago actually I
 
02:52:10.910 --> 02:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
read a 44-page working paper shows that
 
02:52:12.830 --> 02:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
states have been regulating boycotts for
 
02:52:15.290 --> 02:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
centuries this bill is consistent with
 
02:52:16.730 --> 02:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
the nation's history
 
02:52:19.309 --> 02:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
a tradition of boycott regulations does
 
02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
not offend the First Amendment thank you
 
02:52:26.510 --> 02:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:29.389 --> 02:52:29.399 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
02:52:31.910 --> 02:52:31.920 align:start position:0%

yes representative Schmidt
goodbye

02:52:38.530 --> 02:52:38.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:42.290 --> 02:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely I'll hand this right over
 
02:52:47.090 --> 02:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:49.250 --> 02:52:49.260 align:start position:0%

02:52:53.150 --> 02:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
okay other than that I'd like to say
 
02:52:54.590 --> 02:52:54.600 align:start position:0%

indeed
 
02:53:06.110 --> 02:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:09.830 --> 02:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:09.840 --> 02:53:14.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:53:14.590 --> 02:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:16.849 --> 02:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
my name is Scott Dickman I live right
 
02:53:19.730 --> 02:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
here in Concord New Hampshire
 
02:53:23.090 --> 02:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
Madam chair firstly I thank you uh each
 
02:53:24.530 --> 02:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
and every one of you
 
02:53:26.929 --> 02:53:26.939 align:start position:0%
uh for providing an opportunity to
 
02:53:28.670 --> 02:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
address this committee a model of
 
02:53:30.230 --> 02:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
democracy at work
 
02:53:32.450 --> 02:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
where disagreements about proposed
 
02:53:35.809 --> 02:53:35.819 align:start position:0%
legislation can all be heard and debated
 
02:53:37.790 --> 02:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
for this precise reason I stand before
 
02:53:41.090 --> 02:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
you today or I sit before you today as a
 
02:53:43.910 --> 02:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
Jew who in 1973 upon the outbreak of War
 
02:53:46.010 --> 02:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
called the Israeli Embassy in New York
 
02:53:48.469 --> 02:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
City to volunteer
 
02:53:50.450 --> 02:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
blown into Israel by the government with
 
02:53:52.190 --> 02:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
several other volunteers
 
02:53:52.200 --> 02:53:53.570 align:start position:0%
several other volunteers
um

02:53:53.570 --> 02:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:55.070 --> 02:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
I lived there for several years
 
02:53:57.710 --> 02:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
motivated by a protective love for that
 
02:53:57.720 --> 02:53:59.090 align:start position:0%
motivated by a protective love for that
country

02:53:59.090 --> 02:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:54:00.710 --> 02:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
and I tell you this to negate the
 
02:54:02.690 --> 02:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
proposition that individuals opposed to
 
02:54:05.570 --> 02:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
this legislation are anti-Semitic
 
02:54:08.330 --> 02:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
any such suggestion is is at the very
 
02:54:09.710 --> 02:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
least deceitful
 
02:54:11.690 --> 02:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
and used to avoid any discussion of
 
02:54:13.969 --> 02:54:13.979 align:start position:0%
Israel of Israeli policies towards
 
02:54:13.979 --> 02:54:15.410 align:start position:0%
Israel of Israeli policies towards
Palestinians

02:54:15.410 --> 02:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
Palestinians
 
02:54:18.110 --> 02:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
I personally oppose BDS
 
02:54:21.410 --> 02:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
yet I ask that you defend free speech of
 
02:54:23.690 --> 02:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
all Americans by opposing any effort to
 
02:54:26.510 --> 02:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
pass deeply misguided legislation that
 
02:54:30.050 --> 02:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
undermines the very same core principle
 
02:54:32.389 --> 02:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
of American democracy on display at
 
02:54:33.830 --> 02:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
today's hearing
 
02:54:36.050 --> 02:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
I firmly believe that that legislating
 
02:54:38.090 --> 02:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
against boycotts which are a form of
 
02:54:39.650 --> 02:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
speech protected under the First
 
02:54:42.230 --> 02:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment opens the door to much broader
 
02:54:45.349 --> 02:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
government control of public discourse
 
02:54:47.690 --> 02:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we reject this framework in any
 
02:54:49.190 --> 02:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
other context
 
02:54:50.990 --> 02:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
so too then in the fight against all
 
02:54:53.389 --> 02:54:53.399 align:start position:0%
forms of anti-semitism
 
02:54:55.450 --> 02:54:55.460 align:start position:0%
we must uphold our most fundamental
 
02:54:58.190 --> 02:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
Democratic principles
 
02:54:59.870 --> 02:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
while proponents of legislative
 
02:55:02.330 --> 02:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
penalties on BDS supporters portray the
 
02:55:05.150 --> 02:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
reference as pro-israel the proposed
 
02:55:07.309 --> 02:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
legislation will have no impact on
 
02:55:09.469 --> 02:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
bringing about a peace agreement or even
 
02:55:12.650 --> 02:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
wiping out anti-semitism
 
02:55:14.330 --> 02:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
namely working toward a two-state
 
02:55:14.340 --> 02:55:15.650 align:start position:0%
namely working toward a two-state
solution

02:55:15.650 --> 02:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
solution
 
02:55:17.570 --> 02:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
and a long-term person peace agreement
 
02:55:19.250 --> 02:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
that creates a better future for both
 
02:55:21.889 --> 02:55:21.899 align:start position:0%
Israelis and Palestinians
 
02:55:23.929 --> 02:55:23.939 align:start position:0%
this objective can only materialize
 
02:55:26.570 --> 02:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
through debate and negotiation
 
02:55:29.269 --> 02:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
in conclusion I ask you to to oppose any
 
02:55:31.550 --> 02:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
legislation that speaks that seeks to
 
02:55:33.769 --> 02:55:33.779 align:start position:0%
buy to silence or suppress free speech
 
02:55:36.550 --> 02:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
and non-violent activism a repeat
 
02:55:40.070 --> 02:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:42.410 --> 02:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
um as isn't that the Holy Grail of
 
02:55:44.269 --> 02:55:44.279 align:start position:0%
American democracy
 
02:55:46.250 --> 02:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
negating free speech is the least
 
02:55:48.170 --> 02:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
constructive Avenue towards a negotiated
 
02:55:52.130 --> 02:55:52.140 align:start position:0%
solution to this or any conflict
 
02:55:52.140 --> 02:55:53.750 align:start position:0%
solution to this or any conflict
um

02:55:53.750 --> 02:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:56.690 --> 02:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
and I have to add listening to some of
 
02:55:59.690 --> 02:55:59.700 align:start position:0%
the prior testimony that
 
02:56:02.650 --> 02:56:02.660 align:start position:0%
um I I've heard reference to the
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
anti-discriminate discriminatory
 
02:56:07.670 --> 02:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
benefits that this legislation
 
02:56:09.950 --> 02:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
carries in its toe
 
02:56:12.950 --> 02:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
um and I and I find that
 
02:56:15.889 --> 02:56:15.899 align:start position:0%
um difficult to digest
 
02:56:15.899 --> 02:56:19.370 align:start position:0%
um difficult to digest
um

02:56:19.370 --> 02:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:21.410 --> 02:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
and I think the legislation is flawed
 
02:56:25.010 --> 02:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
for this reason there there is BDS
 
02:56:26.690 --> 02:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
um and then there is something referred
 
02:56:29.570 --> 02:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
to as limited BDS which refers only to
 
02:56:33.230 --> 02:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
the boycott of of goods and services in
 
02:56:36.230 --> 02:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
the occupied territories the occupied
 
02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:38.570 align:start position:0%
the occupied territories the occupied
territories

02:56:38.570 --> 02:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
territories
 
02:56:41.269 --> 02:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
um violate international law
 
02:56:43.610 --> 02:56:43.620 align:start position:0%
and that's been well established by the
 
02:56:45.410 --> 02:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
United Nations
 
02:56:47.870 --> 02:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
um could you please focus on the bill I
 
02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the history lesson but
 
02:56:52.370 --> 02:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for that background but
 
02:56:54.349 --> 02:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
hearing is the distinction that that
 
02:56:57.290 --> 02:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
pertains directly to the bill
 
02:56:57.300 --> 02:56:57.830 align:start position:0%
pertains directly to the bill
um

02:56:57.830 --> 02:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:59.590 --> 02:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:57:02.990 --> 02:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
the suggestion that BDS
 
02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:04.610 align:start position:0%
the suggestion that BDS
that

02:57:04.610 --> 02:57:04.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:57:07.370 --> 02:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
opposing BDS is
 
02:57:07.380 --> 02:57:09.110 align:start position:0%
opposing BDS is
um

02:57:09.110 --> 02:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:11.690 --> 02:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
is to preserve non-describe
 
02:57:11.700 --> 02:57:14.150 align:start position:0%
is to preserve non-describe
non-discrimination

02:57:14.150 --> 02:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination
 
02:57:17.870 --> 02:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
um violates the notion that that there
 
02:57:19.429 --> 02:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
that there is unfortunately the
 
02:57:22.070 --> 02:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
political underpinnings of this
 
02:57:24.650 --> 02:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
um which can't be negated
 
02:57:27.590 --> 02:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
um there there is a BDS limited BDS
 
02:57:31.030 --> 02:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
which seeks to oppose
 
02:57:33.950 --> 02:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
Commerce with the occupied territories
 
02:57:37.250 --> 02:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
which violate international law okay
 
02:57:39.290 --> 02:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and so I would ask
 
02:57:41.150 --> 02:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
that the legislation at the very least
 
02:57:43.670 --> 02:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
be amended to
 
02:57:43.680 --> 02:57:46.490 align:start position:0%
be amended to
um

02:57:46.490 --> 02:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
to oppose BDS
 
02:57:52.790 --> 02:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
only in regard to the territory within
 
02:57:54.410 --> 02:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
the national
 
02:57:58.130 --> 02:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
um the fines of Israeli territory which
 
02:57:58.140 --> 02:57:58.969 align:start position:0%
um the fines of Israeli territory which
is

02:57:58.969 --> 02:57:58.979 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:58:01.969 --> 02:58:01.979 align:start position:0%
to the west of the green line thank you
 
02:58:05.090 --> 02:58:05.100 align:start position:0%
very much all right
 
02:58:19.070 --> 02:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:19.080 --> 02:58:21.710 align:start position:0%
 
hi

02:58:21.710 --> 02:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:23.570 --> 02:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
you'll have to speak into the microphone
 
02:58:23.580 --> 02:58:26.929 align:start position:0%
you'll have to speak into the microphone
please

02:58:26.929 --> 02:58:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:29.510 --> 02:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now okay my name is
 
02:58:32.030 --> 02:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
Cheryl LeBron and I'm representing
 
02:58:34.969 --> 02:58:34.979 align:start position:0%
myself in the organization in New
 
02:58:36.830 --> 02:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire called New Hampshire for
 
02:58:36.840 --> 02:58:42.110 align:start position:0%
Hampshire called New Hampshire for
Israel

02:58:42.110 --> 02:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:45.530 --> 02:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
um what the BDS movements leaders have
 
02:58:48.230 --> 02:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:50.870 --> 02:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
um please do concentrate on the bill and
 
02:58:56.809 --> 02:58:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:56.819 --> 02:58:58.849 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:58:58.849 --> 02:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:59:01.210 --> 02:59:01.220 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that the top level
 
02:59:04.730 --> 02:59:04.740 align:start position:0%
leadership of the BDS movement includes
 
02:59:08.530 --> 02:59:08.540 align:start position:0%
the U.S designated terror group Hamas
 
02:59:13.070 --> 02:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
Palestinian Islamic Jihad and pflp which
 
02:59:15.050 --> 02:59:15.060 align:start position:0%
stands for the popular front for the
 
02:59:17.389 --> 02:59:17.399 align:start position:0%
liberation of Palestine
 
02:59:21.290 --> 02:59:21.300 align:start position:0%
these organizations use Western civil
 
02:59:24.769 --> 02:59:24.779 align:start position:0%
Civil Society organizations to pursue to
 
02:59:26.690 --> 02:59:26.700 align:start position:0%
pursue their goal of destroying the
 
02:59:29.030 --> 02:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
state of Israel
 
02:59:32.150 --> 02:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
the BDS hate movement uses false claims
 
02:59:35.690 --> 02:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
packaging nicely and human right lingo
 
02:59:37.849 --> 02:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
to demonize Israel and promote
 
02:59:40.370 --> 02:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism in order to isolate the
 
02:59:44.389 --> 02:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
Jewish state from its friends and allies
 
02:59:47.929 --> 02:59:47.939 align:start position:0%
the rhetoric of the BDS movement
 
02:59:50.990 --> 02:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
uses has been condemned as anti-semitic
 
02:59:53.150 --> 02:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
by both chambers of the U.S legislative
 
02:59:55.610 --> 02:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
the U.S presidents from both parties in
 
02:59:58.610 --> 02:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
the Secretary General of the U.N
 
03:00:01.670 --> 03:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
the true aims of the BDS help move hate
 
03:00:04.070 --> 03:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
movement become clear when you listen to
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
the movement's leader in their own words
 
03:00:07.910 --> 03:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
number one
 
03:00:11.510 --> 03:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
this is by Ahmed Moore pro-bds author
 
03:00:13.849 --> 03:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
and in the occupation doesn't mean
 
03:00:16.730 --> 03:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
anything if it doesn't mean upending the
 
03:00:19.550 --> 03:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
Jewish State itself BDS does mean the
 
03:00:21.830 --> 03:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
end of the Jewish State excellent thank
 
03:00:25.250 --> 03:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
you we we get that point what else do
 
03:00:27.110 --> 03:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
you have that's relevant to the bill in
 
03:00:27.120 --> 03:00:30.530 align:start position:0%
you have that's relevant to the bill in
question

03:00:30.530 --> 03:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:32.809 --> 03:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
I think the BDS movement will gain
 
03:00:34.849 --> 03:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
strength from forthrightly explaining
 
03:00:37.370 --> 03:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
why Israel has no right to Exist by John
 
03:00:37.380 --> 03:00:38.809 align:start position:0%
why Israel has no right to Exist by John

03:00:38.809 --> 03:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
pritzer
 
03:00:41.389 --> 03:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:00:58.910 --> 03:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:00.530 --> 03:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the House of
 
03:01:02.210 --> 03:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
Representatives thank you for having me
 
03:01:04.010 --> 03:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's my first time speaking at the
 
03:01:05.510 --> 03:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
government building so I apologize if I
 
03:01:07.250 --> 03:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
stutter I'm a little bit nervous
 
03:01:09.769 --> 03:01:09.779 align:start position:0%
my name is abdullatif I am a resident of
 
03:01:11.690 --> 03:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
Lebanon New Hampshire
 
03:01:14.630 --> 03:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
I am an ethnically jewish practitioner
 
03:01:16.190 --> 03:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
of the Muslim faith
 
03:01:19.490 --> 03:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
so when I hear that BDS discriminatory
 
03:01:21.290 --> 03:01:21.300 align:start position:0%
or criticism of the state of Israel is
 
03:01:23.450 --> 03:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
somehow discriminatory or identity based
 
03:01:25.849 --> 03:01:25.859 align:start position:0%
or anti-semitic it very often feels like
 
03:01:28.370 --> 03:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
a denial of my own existence I just want
 
03:01:30.230 --> 03:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
to put that out there frankly when it
 
03:01:31.550 --> 03:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
comes to this bill I'm a little bit
 
03:01:31.560 --> 03:01:33.170 align:start position:0%
comes to this bill I'm a little bit
confused

03:01:33.170 --> 03:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
confused
 
03:01:36.650 --> 03:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
uh there is a desire to stop to not
 
03:01:38.809 --> 03:01:38.819 align:start position:0%
invest in people that are boycotting the
 
03:01:40.790 --> 03:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
state of Israel to in fact boycott
 
03:01:42.290 --> 03:01:42.300 align:start position:0%
against people who are boycotting the
 
03:01:44.030 --> 03:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
state of Israel that is quite
 
03:01:46.190 --> 03:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
paradoxical it is quite confusing it
 
03:01:47.809 --> 03:01:47.819 align:start position:0%
feels quite discriminatory frankly if
 
03:01:49.730 --> 03:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
there's a Palestinian family business
 
03:01:51.170 --> 03:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
that they don't want to invest in Israel
 
03:01:53.030 --> 03:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
for their own family reasons and we will
 
03:01:55.010 --> 03:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
not invest in them as a state because of
 
03:01:57.170 --> 03:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
this that seems incredibly incredibly
 
03:01:59.510 --> 03:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and we've heard a lot of
 
03:02:02.269 --> 03:02:02.279 align:start position:0%
legalese about why you know economic
 
03:02:05.210 --> 03:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
actions are not Free Speech but frankly
 
03:02:07.130 --> 03:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
this is New Hampshire our state motto is
 
03:02:11.510 --> 03:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die uh it does feel like it
 
03:02:13.190 --> 03:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
is somehow or the other for particular
 
03:02:15.290 --> 03:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
reasons to protect to stop a particular
 
03:02:17.750 --> 03:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
type of political action we have argued
 
03:02:19.790 --> 03:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
that somehow this economic action is not
 
03:02:21.590 --> 03:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
free speech when in fact in the
 
03:02:23.389 --> 03:02:23.399 align:start position:0%
colloquial sense in the day-to-day sense
 
03:02:26.210 --> 03:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
how I spend my money is my business it
 
03:02:27.950 --> 03:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
is free speech and if someone chooses
 
03:02:29.330 --> 03:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
not to again there's inaction that's
 
03:02:31.309 --> 03:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
taking place a lot of the examples that
 
03:02:33.710 --> 03:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
the former rep spoke again very
 
03:02:36.230 --> 03:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
eloquently about were actions of action
 
03:02:38.990 --> 03:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
giving military weapons to Russia is if
 
03:02:41.269 --> 03:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
actual action it's a positive out you're
 
03:02:43.490 --> 03:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
doing something to not invest to not
 
03:02:45.110 --> 03:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
give money to not do something like this
 
03:02:46.969 --> 03:02:46.979 align:start position:0%
is quite the opposite I really find it
 
03:02:49.250 --> 03:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
to not be comparable
 
03:02:51.050 --> 03:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
and and finally you just want to make
 
03:02:53.870 --> 03:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
this very clear this is again making
 
03:02:56.090 --> 03:02:56.100 align:start position:0%
something people's private action it's
 
03:02:58.070 --> 03:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
making a humanitarian issue a political
 
03:03:00.349 --> 03:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
issue somehow inaccessible stopping
 
03:03:01.910 --> 03:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
people from expressing themselves from
 
03:03:03.590 --> 03:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
giving some sort of criticism
 
03:03:05.690 --> 03:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh and I really hope that the New
 
03:03:05.700 --> 03:03:07.250 align:start position:0%
uh and I really hope that the New
Hampshire

03:03:07.250 --> 03:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:03:08.929 --> 03:03:08.939 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives does not follow
 
03:03:10.610 --> 03:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
these other states who I believe are
 
03:03:12.230 --> 03:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
frankly making a mistake the fact that
 
03:03:14.510 --> 03:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
many people are doing something does not
 
03:03:16.910 --> 03:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
make it right we have to stand for what
 
03:03:18.349 --> 03:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
is actually right for what is actually
 
03:03:21.410 --> 03:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
just and also financially I yes Israel
 
03:03:23.030 --> 03:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
has done amazing Innovations you know
 
03:03:25.309 --> 03:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
ways Etc other apps there are a lot of
 
03:03:26.510 --> 03:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
other countries that are doing a lot of
 
03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
financial things I think a particular
 
03:03:29.870 --> 03:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
company not investing in them
 
03:03:31.429 --> 03:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
they may have other Investments it
 
03:03:32.510 --> 03:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like it's a financially
 
03:03:34.370 --> 03:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
foolish decision as has been claimed
 
03:03:36.889 --> 03:03:36.899 align:start position:0%
many many a Time thank you for your time
 
03:03:38.690 --> 03:03:38.700 align:start position:0%

03:03:40.130 --> 03:03:40.140 align:start position:0%

03:03:41.950 --> 03:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
we can listen fast
 
03:03:52.309 --> 03:03:52.319 align:start position:0%

Purim the second day of the holiday of
 
03:04:19.969 --> 03:04:19.979 align:start position:0%
Purim which remembers a series of events
 
03:04:22.550 --> 03:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
in Persia 2300 years ago when a man
 
03:04:24.230 --> 03:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
named Haman plotted to slaughter
 
03:04:25.969 --> 03:04:25.979 align:start position:0%
Persia's Jews but in the end was
 
03:04:27.290 --> 03:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
thwarted through the intercession of
 
03:04:29.170 --> 03:04:29.180 align:start position:0%
Queen Esther in an act of the king
 
03:04:31.969 --> 03:04:31.979 align:start position:0%
today's A fitting day to pass an
 
03:04:33.769 --> 03:04:33.779 align:start position:0%
anti-bds Bill through Committee in New
 
03:04:33.779 --> 03:04:35.389 align:start position:0%
anti-bds Bill through Committee in New
Hampshire

03:04:35.389 --> 03:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:04:35.399 --> 03:04:36.410 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
um

03:04:36.410 --> 03:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:38.630 --> 03:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
I had some testimony a lot of my topics
 
03:04:40.370 --> 03:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
were covered already I'd like to cover a
 
03:04:41.450 --> 03:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
couple of points that were that were
 
03:04:43.750 --> 03:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
brought up to keep it brief
 
03:04:47.150 --> 03:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
to rep gerhard's question about about
 
03:04:49.370 --> 03:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
the Arizona law it was never struck down
 
03:04:50.750 --> 03:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
there was an injunction putting it on
 
03:04:53.090 --> 03:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
hold while it was looked at same with a
 
03:04:54.590 --> 03:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
few of the other states but in no state
 
03:04:56.929 --> 03:04:56.939 align:start position:0%
was it stuck down struck down and in
 
03:04:58.010 --> 03:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
every state where it was challenged
 
03:04:59.929 --> 03:04:59.939 align:start position:0%
those laws are still in place and were
 
03:05:02.210 --> 03:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
found constitutional as uh discussed in
 
03:05:05.450 --> 03:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
detail by representative Birch
 
03:05:05.460 --> 03:05:06.050 align:start position:0%
detail by representative Birch
um

03:05:06.050 --> 03:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:08.750 --> 03:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
one of the the topics that's been raised
 
03:05:11.450 --> 03:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
in the question asked is um is is how is
 
03:05:14.450 --> 03:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
this uh how is this bill
 
03:05:16.670 --> 03:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
to be understood as anti-discrimination
 
03:05:18.710 --> 03:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
I would say there's an analogy to be
 
03:05:20.510 --> 03:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
looked at just in in contracts and the
 
03:05:22.429 --> 03:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
way contracts are done there are
 
03:05:24.349 --> 03:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
affirmations of non-discrimination that
 
03:05:26.809 --> 03:05:26.819 align:start position:0%
companies make in order to be eligible
 
03:05:28.969 --> 03:05:28.979 align:start position:0%
for a state contract
 
03:05:31.610 --> 03:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
a couple of people said
 
03:05:35.690 --> 03:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
well if you uh if you were to not invest
 
03:05:37.490 --> 03:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
in a company that's boycotting Israel
 
03:05:39.170 --> 03:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
you're limiting your investment Universe
 
03:05:41.210 --> 03:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
I'd say you might make the same argument
 
03:05:42.410 --> 03:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
if you
 
03:05:44.150 --> 03:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
um if you won't contract with a company
 
03:05:46.250 --> 03:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
that says they discriminate on the basis
 
03:05:48.290 --> 03:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
of race or sex or national origin you're
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
limiting your Contracting universe but
 
03:05:52.730 --> 03:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
the state has said repeatedly we have an
 
03:05:55.490 --> 03:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
obligation to our citizens uh to not
 
03:05:58.610 --> 03:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
engage in discrimination and and it's in
 
03:06:01.070 --> 03:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
that same vein that that uh that this
 
03:06:03.650 --> 03:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
law is put forward
 
03:06:03.660 --> 03:06:04.730 align:start position:0%
law is put forward
um

03:06:04.730 --> 03:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:08.510 --> 03:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
there was uh there was a topic raised um
 
03:06:11.210 --> 03:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
by uh by a gentleman who spoke about
 
03:06:13.790 --> 03:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
limited BDS also known as territories
 
03:06:15.290 --> 03:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
only BDS
 
03:06:18.530 --> 03:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
um American law U.S federal law and the
 
03:06:21.710 --> 03:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
2015 TPO treats Israel as an economic
 
03:06:24.530 --> 03:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
monolith so that means you can't
 
03:06:26.929 --> 03:06:26.939 align:start position:0%
differentiate and the fact is as we saw
 
03:06:29.090 --> 03:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
in the case of Unilever when they said
 
03:06:31.790 --> 03:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to do a territories only uh
 
03:06:35.510 --> 03:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
boycott uh similarly when Airbnb in 2019
 
03:06:37.309 --> 03:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
said we're going to do a territories
 
03:06:39.170 --> 03:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
only boycott against Jews and only allow
 
03:06:41.269 --> 03:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
Arabs to list their homes for vacation
 
03:06:44.330 --> 03:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
rental but nachos this went against
 
03:06:46.849 --> 03:06:46.859 align:start position:0%
American Trade policy
 
03:06:48.590 --> 03:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
because the fact is Israel is a small
 
03:06:49.910 --> 03:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
state it's about the size of New
 
03:06:52.309 --> 03:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's 10 000 square miles and
 
03:06:55.130 --> 03:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
the country uh in addition to its own
 
03:06:55.140 --> 03:06:56.090 align:start position:0%
the country uh in addition to its own
laws

03:06:56.090 --> 03:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
laws
 
03:06:58.309 --> 03:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
not allowing discrimination based on
 
03:07:00.170 --> 03:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
based on place or based on on
 
03:07:00.180 --> 03:07:01.849 align:start position:0%
based on place or based on on
nationality

03:07:01.849 --> 03:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
nationality
 
03:07:04.370 --> 03:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
um it's one small economy so the banks
 
03:07:06.469 --> 03:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
are the banks everywhere both in the
 
03:07:08.090 --> 03:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
liberated part of of the old city of
 
03:07:11.990 --> 03:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
Jerusalem and in the uh the pre-48 uh
 
03:07:14.510 --> 03:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
side of Jerusalem
 
03:07:14.520 --> 03:07:15.290 align:start position:0%
side of Jerusalem
um

03:07:15.290 --> 03:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:17.690 --> 03:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
likewise the same gas stations serve all
 
03:07:19.370 --> 03:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
over the same Telecom company when you
 
03:07:20.870 --> 03:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
get your your cell phone there's no way
 
03:07:24.290 --> 03:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
to break up Israel and also
 
03:07:26.570 --> 03:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
from a moral perspective uh
 
03:07:28.790 --> 03:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination against a Jew for living
 
03:07:30.370 --> 03:07:30.380 align:start position:0%
in the biblical Heartland
 
03:07:33.950 --> 03:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
is as egregious as as uh discriminating
 
03:07:36.410 --> 03:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
against one who who lives in Tel Aviv
 
03:07:37.969 --> 03:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
um and another comment that was made
 
03:07:40.370 --> 03:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
that it's against uh international law
 
03:07:42.950 --> 03:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
well U.S policy is that it is not
 
03:07:45.230 --> 03:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
illegal for Jews to live in the biblical
 
03:07:47.389 --> 03:07:47.399 align:start position:0%
Heartland of Judea and Samaria and this
 
03:07:50.030 --> 03:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
is in keeping with a uh with a U.S law
 
03:07:52.550 --> 03:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
passed through Congress in 1924 that
 
03:07:55.370 --> 03:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
recognized the League of Nations mandate
 
03:07:57.349 --> 03:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
for the creation of a Jewish state in
 
03:07:59.870 --> 03:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
those lands which was never abrogated so
 
03:08:01.610 --> 03:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
the fact that all the Jews were kicked
 
03:08:04.610 --> 03:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
out in 48 by the jordanians from those
 
03:08:06.650 --> 03:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
Highlands of Judea and Samaria and then
 
03:08:08.690 --> 03:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
returned after 67
 
03:08:12.769 --> 03:08:12.779 align:start position:0%
that expulsion never made it uh a legal
 
03:08:14.330 --> 03:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
thing in international law excuse me
 
03:08:16.790 --> 03:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
please don't debate the other test
 
03:08:18.950 --> 03:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
testifiers let's just talk about the
 
03:08:21.290 --> 03:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
Bill yes ma'am
 
03:08:23.929 --> 03:08:23.939 align:start position:0%
um I would say uh one one more analogy
 
03:08:26.630 --> 03:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
for for for those who find it hard to
 
03:08:28.730 --> 03:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
understand what BDS has to do with
 
03:08:31.610 --> 03:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
discrimination if a chinese-american
 
03:08:33.950 --> 03:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
were boycotted because of someone's
 
03:08:36.650 --> 03:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
hatred for China or China's policies it
 
03:08:39.110 --> 03:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
would be readily understood as an act of
 
03:08:40.730 --> 03:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
racist or national origin based
 
03:08:40.740 --> 03:08:42.050 align:start position:0%
racist or national origin based
discrimination

03:08:42.050 --> 03:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
similarly when people boycott not only
 
03:08:46.309 --> 03:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
the BDS movement boycotts not only
 
03:08:49.730 --> 03:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
Israel and Israeli companies but also uh
 
03:08:51.530 --> 03:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
Israeli American-owned companies Jewish
 
03:08:53.990 --> 03:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
companies and those who do business with
 
03:08:57.830 --> 03:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
them uh the analogy should be clear
 
03:08:57.840 --> 03:09:00.050 align:start position:0%
them uh the analogy should be clear
so

03:09:00.050 --> 03:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:09:01.370 --> 03:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
I think that'll do it if there's any
 
03:09:03.110 --> 03:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
questions I'm happy to address them
 
03:09:07.849 --> 03:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:07.859 --> 03:09:10.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:09:10.750 --> 03:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:09:16.130 --> 03:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:17.690 --> 03:09:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just want to
 
03:09:19.250 --> 03:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
clarify I did look that case up and it
 
03:09:20.929 --> 03:09:20.939 align:start position:0%
turns out the guy had an 18. please
 
03:09:23.030 --> 03:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
please we don't want to debate case law
 
03:09:24.410 --> 03:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
no I don't want to debate I just want to
 
03:09:26.450 --> 03:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
clarify that so he had a contract for
 
03:09:27.410 --> 03:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
eighteen thousand dollars the
 
03:09:28.910 --> 03:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
legislature changed the law to make it a
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars or greater or
 
03:09:32.389 --> 03:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
ten or more employees so it was deemed
 
03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
moot it wasn't overturned I just wanted
 
03:09:36.530 --> 03:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct it was the movie and
 
03:09:38.090 --> 03:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
the legislature issued a statement at
 
03:09:39.230 --> 03:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
the time they said we want to make it
 
03:09:40.969 --> 03:09:40.979 align:start position:0%
very clear that we don't want to impede
 
03:09:43.309 --> 03:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
anyone's uh anyone's First Amendment
 
03:09:45.110 --> 03:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
rights and in the case of an independent
 
03:09:47.750 --> 03:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh proprietor sole proprietor business
 
03:09:49.490 --> 03:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
there could be some gray area or
 
03:09:52.010 --> 03:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
murkiness so let's make it clear and so
 
03:09:54.290 --> 03:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
they said exactly those changes he did
 
03:09:58.550 --> 03:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:06.769 --> 03:10:06.779 align:start position:0%
you'll have to spell your name I'm
 
03:10:14.050 --> 03:10:14.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:21.130 --> 03:10:21.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:23.389 --> 03:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
r-a-m-s-e-y-l-a-l-s-h-e-i-k-h I am a
 
03:10:25.250 --> 03:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth student
 
03:10:27.410 --> 03:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
um I do a lot of things on campus over
 
03:10:28.910 --> 03:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
for the newspaper for one I just
 
03:10:30.889 --> 03:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
published an article saying uh why this
 
03:10:32.690 --> 03:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
bill has several problems I'm very
 
03:10:35.090 --> 03:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
concerned about personally uh number one
 
03:10:35.100 --> 03:10:36.469 align:start position:0%
concerned about personally uh number one
being

03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
being
 
03:10:38.630 --> 03:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
um probably it's unconstitutionality we
 
03:10:40.790 --> 03:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
live in a state uh whose motto is Live
 
03:10:43.849 --> 03:10:43.859 align:start position:0%
Free or Die uh if I remember correctly
 
03:10:45.950 --> 03:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's not live for Israel or die it's
 
03:10:47.690 --> 03:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
about American citizens and their rights
 
03:10:49.610 --> 03:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
as guaranteed in the Constitution
 
03:10:52.370 --> 03:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
contrary to what some um some words that
 
03:10:54.050 --> 03:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
haven't spoken here a boycotting is a
 
03:10:55.490 --> 03:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
valid form of political expression if
 
03:10:57.530 --> 03:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
it's being used to that and not to
 
03:11:00.170 --> 03:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
benefit any economic actors there are
 
03:11:01.910 --> 03:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
several presidents for this such as
 
03:11:03.769 --> 03:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
anti-racist boycotts in America Martin
 
03:11:06.469 --> 03:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
Luther King South Africa boycotting has
 
03:11:08.150 --> 03:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
been a very well established technique
 
03:11:10.309 --> 03:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
to voice political dissent and it's a
 
03:11:12.830 --> 03:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
protected technique as many legal cases
 
03:11:15.110 --> 03:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
have ruled uh specifically as regards to
 
03:11:16.550 --> 03:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
BDS if you want to go there there have
 
03:11:18.370 --> 03:11:18.380 align:start position:0%
been Federal cases in Arkansas Kansas
 
03:11:21.349 --> 03:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
Georgia and Texas I've upheld the right
 
03:11:23.750 --> 03:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
of uh BDS you know boycotters to use
 
03:11:25.490 --> 03:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
their their right to express themselves
 
03:11:28.010 --> 03:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
politically through boycotts
 
03:11:30.530 --> 03:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
um this is to me a very clearly a bill
 
03:11:32.809 --> 03:11:32.819 align:start position:0%
that seeks to limit that right or at
 
03:11:35.210 --> 03:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
least to try and coerce people not to
 
03:11:37.429 --> 03:11:37.439 align:start position:0%
use that right by withholding funds from
 
03:11:39.650 --> 03:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
companies that choose to exercise that
 
03:11:41.389 --> 03:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
right it's an attempt to Blacklist
 
03:11:43.730 --> 03:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
companies which voice their political
 
03:11:45.290 --> 03:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
Expressions I mean we can get into the
 
03:11:47.269 --> 03:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
all the legalese about that um I have
 
03:11:48.650 --> 03:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
finals to study for so I'm not going to
 
03:11:51.410 --> 03:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
go review all of the case law for that
 
03:11:54.290 --> 03:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
but to me it's a very clear-cut uh
 
03:11:56.389 --> 03:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
instance of constitutional right it's
 
03:11:59.150 --> 03:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
not about anything other than that to me
 
03:12:01.309 --> 03:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
the idea that somehow this is related to
 
03:12:03.950 --> 03:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination is uh quite odd for me
 
03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
personally uh considering that I don't
 
03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
see a single person of you know color in
 
03:12:10.190 --> 03:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
this room and I think that
 
03:12:11.870 --> 03:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
um you know criticizing a state for its
 
03:12:13.309 --> 03:12:13.319 align:start position:0%
policies which have been condemned by
 
03:12:14.690 --> 03:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
international human rights organizations
 
03:12:16.550 --> 03:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
is not discrimination in fact that seems
 
03:12:18.349 --> 03:12:18.359 align:start position:0%
to me like very valid criticism and I
 
03:12:20.030 --> 03:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
think any company which chooses to
 
03:12:21.410 --> 03:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
protecting that for whatever reason
 
03:12:24.710 --> 03:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
should have that right guaranteed
 
03:12:27.110 --> 03:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
um the idea that this is somehow an
 
03:12:28.190 --> 03:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
issue of discrimination doesn't make
 
03:12:29.750 --> 03:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
sense to me also because there are many
 
03:12:31.670 --> 03:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh Jewish organizations in America which
 
03:12:33.650 --> 03:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
support BDS for example Jewish voice for
 
03:12:35.870 --> 03:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
peace many individuals I've talked to in
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
my life who have supported BDS although
 
03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
it's not the normal position there are
 
03:12:41.750 --> 03:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
many Jewish folks who do support that
 
03:12:43.610 --> 03:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
and I think kind of trying to paint it
 
03:12:46.190 --> 03:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
like every Jew is somehow opposed to BDS
 
03:12:48.950 --> 03:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
is we've already heard that well we did
 
03:12:51.349 --> 03:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
hear that and I stand for that so for me
 
03:12:52.910 --> 03:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
this is a very clear instance of
 
03:12:55.010 --> 03:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
violating a First Amendment writes this
 
03:12:56.929 --> 03:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
is I can go into a whole moral issues
 
03:12:57.950 --> 03:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
with this bill considering what's going
 
03:12:59.750 --> 03:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
on please don't Israel Palestine right
 
03:13:01.610 --> 03:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
now I will not but
 
03:13:03.950 --> 03:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
on the whole I think this is a very
 
03:13:05.750 --> 03:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
serious matter uh regarding
 
03:13:07.550 --> 03:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
constitutionality if there's any
 
03:13:09.349 --> 03:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
questions I'd love to take them thank
 
03:13:10.670 --> 03:13:10.680 align:start position:0%

all right thank you thank you very much
 
03:13:29.690 --> 03:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you very much
 
03:13:42.050 --> 03:13:42.060 align:start position:0%

03:13:56.809 --> 03:13:56.819 align:start position:0%
American Council of New England and
 
03:13:59.210 --> 03:13:59.220 align:start position:0%
because of that I'm here representing uh
 
03:14:01.610 --> 03:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
the private businesses of some Israeli
 
03:14:03.110 --> 03:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
citizens right here in New Hampshire
 
03:14:06.410 --> 03:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
from as small as five to as many as more
 
03:14:09.469 --> 03:14:09.479 align:start position:0%
than 1500 people the BDS movement seeks
 
03:14:11.510 --> 03:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
to delegitimize and isolate Israel by
 
03:14:12.950 --> 03:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
boycotting Israeli products and
 
03:14:15.110 --> 03:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
companies this has a direct impact on
 
03:14:17.090 --> 03:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
israeli-owned businesses causing harm to
 
03:14:18.889 --> 03:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
their employees and their ability to
 
03:14:21.710 --> 03:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
operate BDS campaigns often Target small
 
03:14:23.570 --> 03:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
and medium-sized Israeli businesses that
 
03:14:25.790 --> 03:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
rely on exports including to places like
 
03:14:27.889 --> 03:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
right here in New Hampshire to sustain
 
03:14:29.929 --> 03:14:29.939 align:start position:0%
their operations these businesses are
 
03:14:31.790 --> 03:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
often run by ordinary Israelis who are
 
03:14:32.870 --> 03:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
just trying to make a living and
 
03:14:35.090 --> 03:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
contribute to their economy the BDS
 
03:14:36.230 --> 03:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
movement's actions also harm
 
03:14:38.090 --> 03:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
Palestinians who work in israeli-owned
 
03:14:40.610 --> 03:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
businesses and rely on them for their
 
03:14:42.170 --> 03:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
livelihoods by targeting Israeli
 
03:14:43.790 --> 03:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
businesses the BDS movements putting the
 
03:14:45.710 --> 03:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
jobs in livelihoods of many Palestinians
 
03:14:47.929 --> 03:14:47.939 align:start position:0%
at risk the BDS movement's targeting of
 
03:14:49.490 --> 03:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
Israeli businesses based on their
 
03:14:51.950 --> 03:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
nationality is discriminatory and goes
 
03:14:53.690 --> 03:14:53.700 align:start position:0%
against the principle bowls of Freedom
 
03:14:56.450 --> 03:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
democracy and human rights it is unfair
 
03:14:58.190 --> 03:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
to punish individuals and businesses
 
03:14:59.690 --> 03:14:59.700 align:start position:0%
based on their nationality and is
 
03:15:01.790 --> 03:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
reminiscent of historical discrimination
 
03:15:03.530 --> 03:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
against Jews I will move on to New
 
03:15:05.389 --> 03:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sorry about that Madam please
 
03:15:09.110 --> 03:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely so directly to New
 
03:15:11.750 --> 03:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire BDS discourages economic
 
03:15:14.210 --> 03:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
investment in New Hampshire by Israeli
 
03:15:16.849 --> 03:15:16.859 align:start position:0%
companies and Israel Israel and
 
03:15:18.830 --> 03:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
specifically Tel Aviv is the fastest
 
03:15:21.050 --> 03:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
growing high-tech sector in the world
 
03:15:23.389 --> 03:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
BDS encourages divestment from New
 
03:15:24.650 --> 03:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire companies that do business
 
03:15:27.349 --> 03:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
with Israel BDS can lead to a reduction
 
03:15:29.570 --> 03:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
in exports from New Hampshire to Israel
 
03:15:31.550 --> 03:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
and other countries due to those
 
03:15:34.429 --> 03:15:34.439 align:start position:0%
boycotts BDS May discourage tourism to
 
03:15:36.349 --> 03:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from countries that merely
 
03:15:39.349 --> 03:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
support the boycott of Israel BDS harms
 
03:15:40.730 --> 03:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
the ability of New Hampshire to attract
 
03:15:42.769 --> 03:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
talented workers from Israel and other
 
03:15:44.330 --> 03:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
countries yes
 
03:15:47.469 --> 03:15:47.479 align:start position:0%
uh excellent how does this apply to us
 
03:15:49.790 --> 03:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
Banning the Banning the retirement
 
03:15:51.830 --> 03:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
system from investing in these companies
 
03:15:54.349 --> 03:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
from Banning the excuse me from
 
03:15:56.929 --> 03:15:56.939 align:start position:0%
investing in companies that are believed
 
03:15:59.750 --> 03:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
to be involved in these activities yes
 
03:16:01.910 --> 03:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
because if somebody is a supporter of
 
03:16:04.610 --> 03:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
BDS and that goes into the law then New
 
03:16:06.110 --> 03:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not going to have as
 
03:16:09.410 --> 03:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
vibrant of an economy if those are if
 
03:16:11.870 --> 03:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
those companies are boycotted so when it
 
03:16:14.210 --> 03:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
comes to the issue of boycott divestment
 
03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
and sanction of Israel Israeli companies
 
03:16:18.590 --> 03:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
and israeli-owned companies right here
 
03:16:21.110 --> 03:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire with the inclusion of
 
03:16:23.690 --> 03:16:23.700 align:start position:0%
BDS you will see a decrease in
 
03:16:26.330 --> 03:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
investment to New Hampshire not just in
 
03:16:28.610 --> 03:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
terms of the economy itself but also in
 
03:16:31.490 --> 03:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
terms of Tourism and simply creating
 
03:16:33.410 --> 03:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
businesses right here in New Hampshire
 
03:16:35.690 --> 03:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
but to go on specifically to the
 
03:16:37.550 --> 03:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
economic harm the BDS movement targets
 
03:16:39.530 --> 03:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
israeli-owned businesses which as I
 
03:16:41.030 --> 03:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned could harm the economic
 
03:16:43.550 --> 03:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
interest of our members who own or work
 
03:16:46.490 --> 03:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
for such businesses the social exclusion
 
03:16:48.530 --> 03:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
many others have talked about it the
 
03:16:50.330 --> 03:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
intimidation tactics the BDS movement
 
03:16:52.790 --> 03:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
uses tactics and this is specific to the
 
03:16:54.889 --> 03:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
small businesses here in New Hampshire
 
03:16:56.990 --> 03:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
but is something I believe must be said
 
03:16:57.000 --> 03:16:58.490 align:start position:0%
but is something I believe must be said
yep

03:16:58.490 --> 03:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:17:01.429 --> 03:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
the question is not on whether we should
 
03:17:03.530 --> 03:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
be encouraging small businesses in New
 
03:17:06.849 --> 03:17:06.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's should we forbid our
 
03:17:09.650 --> 03:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
retirement system to make certain for
 
03:17:12.170 --> 03:17:12.180 align:start position:0%
making certain Investments yes and when
 
03:17:14.269 --> 03:17:14.279 align:start position:0%
it comes to that you don't want to limit
 
03:17:16.730 --> 03:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
any of the Investments with BDS you are
 
03:17:18.290 --> 03:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
going to be limiting the Investments
 
03:17:19.969 --> 03:17:19.979 align:start position:0%
investments in Israeli companies
 
03:17:22.250 --> 03:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
investments in the Israeli economy as we
 
03:17:24.530 --> 03:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned yes but I don't believe I
 
03:17:26.330 --> 03:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
don't believe anyone has said our
 
03:17:31.370 --> 03:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:33.950 --> 03:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
correct correct yes thank you okay good
 
03:17:33.960 --> 03:17:35.269 align:start position:0%
correct correct yes thank you okay good
okay

03:17:35.269 --> 03:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:17:37.190 --> 03:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
I apologize
 
03:17:39.889 --> 03:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
um so just finally overall the BDS
 
03:17:41.750 --> 03:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
movement has the potential to negatively
 
03:17:43.730 --> 03:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
impact the economic social and political
 
03:17:45.889 --> 03:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
interests of New Hampshire members who
 
03:17:48.110 --> 03:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
are Israeli Americans and for that
 
03:17:49.849 --> 03:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
reason I
 
03:17:52.370 --> 03:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
oppose oh sorry I'm for this Bill thank

03:18:07.849 --> 03:18:07.859 align:start position:0%
realized everybody's been saying BDS so
 
03:18:10.309 --> 03:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
just again for the record boycott
 
03:18:12.349 --> 03:18:12.359 align:start position:0%

good afternoon members of the committee
 
03:18:32.030 --> 03:18:32.040 align:start position:0%

03:18:35.750 --> 03:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of New Hampshire youth movement
 
03:18:38.389 --> 03:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
to speak in opposition to HB 339
 
03:18:39.950 --> 03:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
our movement is a signatory on a
 
03:18:41.870 --> 03:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
statement signed by nine other pro-piece
 
03:18:43.490 --> 03:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
pro-human rights solidarity
 
03:18:44.870 --> 03:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
organizations in New Hampshire that
 
03:18:46.130 --> 03:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
03:18:48.530 --> 03:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
I mailed a full copy to this of this
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
statement to the committee last night
 
03:18:51.410 --> 03:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
but if you didn't have a chance to read
 
03:18:54.769 --> 03:18:54.779 align:start position:0%
it I have a copy right here my printer
 
03:18:56.330 --> 03:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
was broken so sorry I don't have one for
 
03:18:57.830 --> 03:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
everyone but if you'd like a photocopy
 
03:19:00.050 --> 03:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to give it over thank you
 
03:19:02.210 --> 03:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
we will take one for the file and we did

get that email excellent
 
03:19:07.490 --> 03:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
um but I would like to use my time today
 
03:19:08.929 --> 03:19:08.939 align:start position:0%
to speak a bit more succinctly to our
 
03:19:11.150 --> 03:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
reasons and I'll keep focused on this
 
03:19:11.160 --> 03:19:12.130 align:start position:0%
reasons and I'll keep focused on this
bill

03:19:12.130 --> 03:19:12.140 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:19:15.769 --> 03:19:15.779 align:start position:0%
out of respect for what you've said we
 
03:19:17.210 --> 03:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill sends an alarming
 
03:19:19.250 --> 03:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
message that would limit the ability to
 
03:19:20.750 --> 03:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
boycott in New Hampshire
 
03:19:22.790 --> 03:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
boycotts are an effective form of a
 
03:19:24.410 --> 03:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
non-violent protest that has been used
 
03:19:27.050 --> 03:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
to protest for to protest civil and
 
03:19:28.969 --> 03:19:28.979 align:start position:0%
human rights abuses in multiple contexts
 
03:19:31.010 --> 03:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
ranging from the time of the American
 
03:19:33.410 --> 03:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
Revolution to the Civil Rights Movement
 
03:19:35.150 --> 03:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
in a more International context you
 
03:19:36.170 --> 03:19:36.180 align:start position:0%
might also be more familiar with
 
03:19:37.550 --> 03:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
boycott's protesting the apartheid
 
03:19:38.929 --> 03:19:38.939 align:start position:0%
regime in South Africa only a few
 
03:19:41.330 --> 03:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
decades ago today some individuals and
 
03:19:42.889 --> 03:19:42.899 align:start position:0%
businesses do employ boycotts to
 
03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
peacefully protest against the Israeli
 
03:19:46.010 --> 03:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
government's involvement
 
03:19:48.170 --> 03:19:48.180 align:start position:0%
anti-palestinian violence and I'd like
 
03:19:50.750 --> 03:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
to emphasize against the actions the
 
03:19:52.370 --> 03:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
government actions of the Israeli
 
03:19:54.410 --> 03:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
government not against Israelis for
 
03:19:56.809 --> 03:19:56.819 align:start position:0%
being Israelis
 
03:19:56.819 --> 03:19:57.469 align:start position:0%
being Israelis
um

03:19:57.469 --> 03:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:59.870 --> 03:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this is not stepped
 
03:20:01.969 --> 03:20:01.979 align:start position:0%
several States from attempting to
 
03:20:04.190 --> 03:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
restrict the right to boycott
 
03:20:05.990 --> 03:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
similar and perhaps even harsher
 
03:20:07.309 --> 03:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
restrictions than this bill have already
 
03:20:08.870 --> 03:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
been implemented in several other states
 
03:20:10.730 --> 03:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
and or are still being debated you might
 
03:20:11.929 --> 03:20:11.939 align:start position:0%
be familiar with some examples in
 
03:20:13.490 --> 03:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
Arkansas lately
 
03:20:15.769 --> 03:20:15.779 align:start position:0%
while we acknowledge that HB 339 would
 
03:20:17.330 --> 03:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
not officially ban companies in New
 
03:20:18.710 --> 03:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from taking part in a boycott
 
03:20:20.750 --> 03:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
we want to emphasize this measure which
 
03:20:22.610 --> 03:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
still represents a blacklist
 
03:20:24.710 --> 03:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
by blocking the investment of State
 
03:20:24.720 --> 03:20:25.849 align:start position:0%
by blocking the investment of State
funds

03:20:25.849 --> 03:20:25.859 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:20:27.710 --> 03:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
this measure still represents the
 
03:20:29.389 --> 03:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
government penalty for companies that
 
03:20:30.590 --> 03:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
hold a certain opinion about
 
03:20:32.630 --> 03:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
International Affairs and participate in
 
03:20:35.030 --> 03:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
a legitimate form of peaceful protest
 
03:20:36.650 --> 03:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
we believe this constitutes an
 
03:20:38.269 --> 03:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
inappropriate form of State interference
 
03:20:40.250 --> 03:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
regardless of where you feel it falls on
 
03:20:42.370 --> 03:20:42.380 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment
 
03:20:44.870 --> 03:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
if passed it would also carry the
 
03:20:46.309 --> 03:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
implica this bill would also carry the
 
03:20:47.809 --> 03:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
implication that New Hampshire is taking
 
03:20:49.969 --> 03:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
a stand on the israeli-palestinian
 
03:20:52.910 --> 03:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
conflicts we know that's still a highly
 
03:20:55.730 --> 03:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
controversial topic to discuss but we
 
03:20:57.410 --> 03:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
feel that it would be inappropriate for
 
03:20:58.910 --> 03:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to be weighing in in this
 
03:21:01.490 --> 03:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
manner even by passing a slot is still
 
03:21:02.690 --> 03:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
picking aside
 
03:21:04.550 --> 03:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
we're not asking the general court to
 
03:21:06.290 --> 03:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
officially weigh in on the conflict but
 
03:21:08.150 --> 03:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
we do ask the legislature refrain from
 
03:21:09.950 --> 03:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
an inflicting punishment from boycotts
 
03:21:11.389 --> 03:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
and other legitimate forms of protest
 
03:21:11.399 --> 03:21:13.250 align:start position:0%
and other legitimate forms of protest
and

03:21:13.250 --> 03:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:16.190 --> 03:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
um with that I urge you to report HP 339
 
03:21:18.170 --> 03:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
as inexpedient to legislate thank you
 
03:21:19.790 --> 03:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
for your time and I'm happy to take any
 
03:21:19.800 --> 03:21:24.230 align:start position:0%
for your time and I'm happy to take any

a century of the of being a professor I
 
03:22:11.929 --> 03:22:11.939 align:start position:0%
learned two things number one when the
 
03:22:14.690 --> 03:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
discussion goes past lunchtime you lose
 
03:22:16.130 --> 03:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
your audience

your audience because we're past

take with them that will remind them my
 
03:22:32.389 --> 03:22:32.399 align:start position:0%

conclusion
 
03:22:45.889 --> 03:22:45.899 align:start position:0%

individual choices for their personal
 
03:24:34.490 --> 03:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
lives but as New Hampshire we have the
 
03:24:36.590 --> 03:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
right to prevent those with specific
 
03:24:38.750 --> 03:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
political agendas from limiting
 
03:24:41.150 --> 03:24:41.160 align:start position:0%

break for lunch
 
03:25:03.229 --> 03:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:19.309 --> 03:25:19.319 align:start position:0%

one of the things that I would
 
03:25:40.200 --> 03:25:41.809 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I would
and

03:25:41.809 --> 03:25:41.819 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:25:46.150 --> 03:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
talking about today is my time in
 
03:25:50.630 --> 03:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
Rwanda in 1993 and 1994. I was the
 
03:25:53.510 --> 03:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
administrative officer there and could
 
03:25:55.190 --> 03:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
you please explain how that has to do
 
03:25:56.990 --> 03:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
something with this bill it has to do
 
03:26:00.410 --> 03:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
with the D and BDS I suggest to you that
 
03:26:03.830 --> 03:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
the D is demonization demonization of
 
03:26:05.929 --> 03:26:05.939 align:start position:0%
one people to another I know exactly
 
03:26:09.190 --> 03:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
what that can lead to and
 
03:26:13.490 --> 03:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
this is the the real issue that we have
 
03:26:17.229 --> 03:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
to face when we're looking at
 
03:26:22.490 --> 03:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
boycott demonization and sanctions and
 
03:26:25.490 --> 03:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh you know I have a prepared statement
 
03:26:27.830 --> 03:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
which I will give to the people talking
 
03:26:32.229 --> 03:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
about this it the fact that
 
03:26:34.790 --> 03:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
anti-zionism is now the new
 
03:26:34.800 --> 03:26:37.729 align:start position:0%
anti-zionism is now the new
anti-semitism

03:26:37.729 --> 03:26:37.739 align:start position:0%
anti-semitism
 
03:26:39.889 --> 03:26:39.899 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:26:42.349 --> 03:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of anti-israel rhetoric of
 
03:26:45.290 --> 03:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
the BDS hate movement and where does all
 
03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
this anti-zion and Zionism lead last
 
03:26:48.239 --> 03:26:49.070 align:start position:0%
this anti-zion and Zionism lead last
week

03:26:49.070 --> 03:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
week
 
03:26:51.110 --> 03:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
a New York federal court sent in the
 
03:26:55.550 --> 03:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
sentencing hearing of Masood a man of a
 
03:26:55.560 --> 03:26:56.630 align:start position:0%
sentencing hearing of Masood a man of a
violent

03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
violent
 
03:26:58.729 --> 03:26:58.739 align:start position:0%
convicted of violently attacking Jews in
 
03:26:59.870 --> 03:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
New York City in at least three
 
03:27:02.210 --> 03:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
occasions proved once again that some
 
03:27:04.269 --> 03:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
anti-zionism is really nothing more than
 
03:27:07.190 --> 03:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism his attorneys actually
 
03:27:11.410 --> 03:27:11.420 align:start position:0%
argued that his case of assault of
 
03:27:14.090 --> 03:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
innocent American Jewish people
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
was because he is in anti-semite but no
 
03:27:20.570 --> 03:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
it was rather he was seeking to promote
 
03:27:23.150 --> 03:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
social and political goals and that he

04:50:22.910 --> 04:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is meeting on Friday we
 
04:50:26.690 --> 04:50:26.700 align:start position:0%

04:50:26.700 --> 04:50:27.650 align:start position:0%
will be executing them on Friday Also
um

04:50:27.650 --> 04:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:31.910 --> 04:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
probably about 1 32 o'clock before our
 
04:50:36.288 --> 04:50:36.298 align:start position:0%
scheduled meeting on House Bill 2.
 
04:50:41.150 --> 04:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:43.128 --> 04:50:43.138 align:start position:0%
the exec is not in the calendar because
 
04:50:44.690 --> 04:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
I have to announce it from the house
 
04:50:44.700 --> 04:50:47.090 align:start position:0%
I have to announce it from the house
floor

04:50:47.090 --> 04:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:47.100 --> 04:50:49.208 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:50:49.208 --> 04:50:49.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:52.550 --> 04:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
and I would also like to mention that
 
04:50:56.090 --> 04:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday we have
 
04:50:58.730 --> 04:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
a few hearings on bills that I expect
 
04:51:01.610 --> 04:51:01.620 align:start position:0%
who will be able to vote on that day
 
04:51:03.708 --> 04:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping not to have to come back
 
04:51:05.690 --> 04:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
for anything on them
 
04:51:05.700 --> 04:51:10.250 align:start position:0%
for anything on them
so

04:51:10.250 --> 04:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:13.430 --> 04:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:17.628 --> 04:51:17.638 align:start position:0%
uh 457 and 559
 
04:51:19.788 --> 04:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
they're both in the pension subcommittee
 
04:51:22.550 --> 04:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
which is meeting Friday
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:34.850 --> 04:51:34.860 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
04:51:34.860 --> 04:51:36.948 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:36.958 --> 04:51:43.128 align:start position:0%
 
let's

04:51:43.128 --> 04:51:43.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:44.750 --> 04:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure he is
 
04:51:46.490 --> 04:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
oh no he stepped out for a minute he's
 
04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
probably in the men's room he'll be here
 
04:51:52.868 --> 04:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
we haven't lost him yet there he is

okay so
um

04:51:58.970 --> 04:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:02.330 --> 04:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll start with with uh one of
 
04:52:06.590 --> 04:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
the bills we heard today House Bill 84
 
04:52:09.530 --> 04:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
which is the Emergency Management powers
 
04:52:11.990 --> 04:52:12.000 align:start position:0%

someone have a motion
 
04:52:16.310 --> 04:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative a bear
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:52:22.810 --> 04:52:22.820 align:start position:0%
I have a motion to itls
 
04:52:27.410 --> 04:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:31.128 --> 04:52:31.138 align:start position:0%
well I'm glad to hear you've got support
 
04:52:33.590 --> 04:52:33.600 align:start position:0%

04:52:35.690 --> 04:52:35.700 align:start position:0%

04:52:37.610 --> 04:52:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I do wish to speak
 
04:52:39.050 --> 04:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
to my motion and thank you
 
04:52:39.060 --> 04:52:40.490 align:start position:0%
to my motion and thank you
representative

04:52:40.490 --> 04:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:52:43.250 --> 04:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
Schmidt for your comments and
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:51.070 --> 04:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:54.288 --> 04:52:54.298 align:start position:0%
excuse me as the testimony that we heard
 
04:52:58.550 --> 04:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
mainly from dot is that we already have
 
04:53:01.610 --> 04:53:01.620 align:start position:0%
a lot in place that we are not
 
04:53:04.010 --> 04:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
necessarily building underneath us or
 
04:53:05.750 --> 04:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
holding the accountability or
 
04:53:08.570 --> 04:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
strengthening to take over this piece of
 
04:53:11.330 --> 04:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
of uh what we're looking for in this
 
04:53:12.948 --> 04:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
legislation and therefore I don't think
 
04:53:15.470 --> 04:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
this is necessary at this time thank you
 
04:53:17.750 --> 04:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
04:53:19.610 --> 04:53:19.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:53:21.650 --> 04:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative for your motion uh the
 
04:53:24.110 --> 04:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
thing is that we all understand that the
 
04:53:26.628 --> 04:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
situation in Acworth was indeed tragic
 
04:53:29.150 --> 04:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
and catastrophic in that particular
 
04:53:29.160 --> 04:53:31.090 align:start position:0%
and catastrophic in that particular
occasion

04:53:31.090 --> 04:53:31.100 align:start position:0%
occasion
 
04:53:33.890 --> 04:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
but this is a kind of in a sense a
 
04:53:37.208 --> 04:53:37.218 align:start position:0%
perfect storm or uh and therefore
 
04:53:40.970 --> 04:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
there's no way that it's possible for
 
04:53:43.850 --> 04:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
the D.O.T under the circumstances to be
 
04:53:45.650 --> 04:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
immediately on the spot if you live
 
04:53:47.330 --> 04:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
right next to the fire station or the
 
04:53:49.310 --> 04:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
police station maybe you'll get instant
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
service on a call but this was the kind
 
04:53:55.190 --> 04:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
of situation where they needed help in
 
04:53:58.550 --> 04:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
all areas could not be done uh and the
 
04:54:00.250 --> 04:54:00.260 align:start position:0%
statute is already in place
 
04:54:02.690 --> 04:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
organizations already in place they
 
04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
maybe need to perfect it a little bit
 
04:54:06.948 --> 04:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't need legislation all
 
04:54:08.690 --> 04:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
right thank you does anyone else have a
 
04:54:08.700 --> 04:54:10.310 align:start position:0%
right thank you does anyone else have a
comment

04:54:10.310 --> 04:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:54:10.320 --> 04:54:13.850 align:start position:0%
comment
oh

04:54:13.850 --> 04:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:17.810 --> 04:54:17.820 align:start position:0%
I don't think so representative shewitt
 
04:54:19.670 --> 04:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:54:22.670 --> 04:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
um I'll just add that uh the comment was
 
04:54:24.230 --> 04:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
made about
 
04:54:24.240 --> 04:54:25.010 align:start position:0%
made about
um

04:54:25.010 --> 04:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:30.128 --> 04:54:30.138 align:start position:0%
having a public works Mutual Aid setup
 
04:54:34.030 --> 04:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
and then the comment was also added that
 
04:54:36.830 --> 04:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
there were questions about who would get
 
04:54:39.830 --> 04:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
paid how if another Town Sent their
 
04:54:42.530 --> 04:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
Public Works employees and this bill
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't address that kind of situation
 
04:54:47.628 --> 04:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
at all so I think going forward as
 
04:54:50.208 --> 04:54:50.218 align:start position:0%
something like this is put forward that
 
04:54:53.448 --> 04:54:53.458 align:start position:0%
type of issue needs to be addressed also
 
04:54:56.270 --> 04:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
um well I heard that there is a public
 
04:55:00.670 --> 04:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
works Mutual Aid Society and it was
 
04:55:04.128 --> 04:55:04.138 align:start position:0%
ineffective in this case because all the
 
04:55:06.948 --> 04:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
towns around were suffering
 
04:55:10.070 --> 04:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
so hey
 
04:55:13.070 --> 04:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
am I not representative O'Brien thank
 
04:55:14.330 --> 04:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
04:55:18.410 --> 04:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
um in the audience today was a former
 
04:55:20.230 --> 04:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
Fire Chief from Hudson
 
04:55:23.990 --> 04:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
Robbie Buxton who now is a Homeland
 
04:55:26.750 --> 04:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
Security and something like this in the
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
future I you know let's we can't dwell
 
04:55:31.910 --> 04:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
upon the past but let's look at the
 
04:55:34.730 --> 04:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
future and I did it was able to have a
 
04:55:37.070 --> 04:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
brief conversation with him and although
 
04:55:39.708 --> 04:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
I am sympathetic to representative
 
04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
Aaron's plea with this uh I don't think
 
04:55:44.810 --> 04:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
what had happened in the past would
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
happen today you know so uh
 
04:55:51.890 --> 04:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
what happens it seems to be the fault of
 
04:55:54.050 --> 04:55:54.060 align:start position:0%
the incident command system and the
 
04:55:56.090 --> 04:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
whole thing in general if we have people
 
04:55:58.190 --> 04:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
at the state level that are willing to
 
04:56:02.090 --> 04:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
uh Supply this uh resource because
 
04:56:05.330 --> 04:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
that's what it's there for these things
 
04:56:08.150 --> 04:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
can quickly get out of control over the
 
04:56:10.730 --> 04:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
capabilities of your average police
 
04:56:14.030 --> 04:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
chief or fire chief you need to help and
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's where the state will come in and
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
to rely on resources through delegation
 
04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
so I think as we move forward that would
 
04:56:25.070 --> 04:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
occur and also too uh sadly I do
 
04:56:26.810 --> 04:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
recommend that the good people of that
 
04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
Community join them mutually Compact and
 
04:56:33.470 --> 04:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
to help out that would go a long way
 
04:56:35.690 --> 04:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
into assist but like you say it's
 
04:56:37.430 --> 04:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
regional when something like this
 
04:56:40.910 --> 04:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
happens it can infect globally other
 
04:56:42.670 --> 04:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
communities right next door to yourself
 
04:56:44.990 --> 04:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that thank you madam
 
04:56:47.150 --> 04:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
chair representative Gould
 
04:56:49.730 --> 04:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair living in a small
 
04:56:51.530 --> 04:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
community and representing people in
 
04:56:54.170 --> 04:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
small towns I really appreciate the need
 
04:56:56.570 --> 04:56:56.580 align:start position:0%
for this and I was very very encouraged
 
04:56:59.390 --> 04:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
by Dot's statement that they are looking
 
04:57:01.910 --> 04:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
very carefully at this and that it's
 
04:57:04.490 --> 04:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
brought up the need for them to take it
 
04:57:06.470 --> 04:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
more seriously because we know that
 
04:57:07.550 --> 04:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
there's going to be more and more of
 
04:57:09.350 --> 04:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
these disasters so thank you for the
 
04:57:09.360 --> 04:57:10.970 align:start position:0%
these disasters so thank you for the
bill

04:57:10.970 --> 04:57:10.980 align:start position:0%

04:57:15.840 --> 04:57:18.708 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:57:18.708 --> 04:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:22.128 --> 04:57:22.138 align:start position:0%
and we have a representative Susie is
 
04:57:25.128 --> 04:57:25.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:26.628 --> 04:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair I'm
 
04:57:28.610 --> 04:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
representative Susan trelelevin and I'm
 
04:57:31.670 --> 04:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
sitting in for a representative and
 
04:57:33.650 --> 04:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for welcoming me yes to your
 
04:57:35.510 --> 04:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
committee thank you I know I've seen you
 
04:57:37.670 --> 04:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
but your name just keeps slipping out of
 
04:57:39.770 --> 04:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
my mind
 
04:57:41.750 --> 04:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
04:57:43.730 --> 04:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
all right in that case the motion is
 
04:57:46.010 --> 04:57:46.020 align:start position:0%

05:00:56.208 --> 05:00:56.218 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt I'm happy to
 
05:00:58.430 --> 05:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
point out that uh that this is
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
definitely an urgent matter for people
 
05:01:04.970 --> 05:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
who are in the situation of a suffering
 
05:01:07.670 --> 05:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
of being animal owners that are
 
05:01:09.948 --> 05:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
suffering or owners of animals that are
 
05:01:09.958 --> 05:01:11.090 align:start position:0%
suffering or owners of animals that are
suffering

05:01:11.090 --> 05:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
suffering
 
05:01:13.310 --> 05:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
um and uh so the owners are suffering
 
05:01:16.490 --> 05:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
too because uh trying to get to a
 
05:01:18.470 --> 05:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
veterinarian I understand it's difficult
 
05:01:20.690 --> 05:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
because there's a long waiting period
 
05:01:23.990 --> 05:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and therefore uh all they they
 
05:01:26.448 --> 05:01:26.458 align:start position:0%
are going to do is get referred is there
 
05:01:30.350 --> 05:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
a cost in that uh and and the the animal
 
05:01:32.868 --> 05:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
chiropractor these people are trained
 
05:01:35.990 --> 05:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
and certified under the amendment
 
05:01:38.510 --> 05:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
um and therefore we're going to get
 
05:01:41.150 --> 05:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
relief for people for whom these animal
 
05:01:44.448 --> 05:01:44.458 align:start position:0%
chiropractors are a solution uh and
 
05:01:47.990 --> 05:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh it's necessary and the
 
05:01:50.448 --> 05:01:50.458 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill uh will be delighted
 
05:01:52.730 --> 05:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
I'm sure when she finds out that we're
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:58.920 --> 05:02:02.090 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:02:02.090 --> 05:02:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:04.750 --> 05:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
in that case the motion is to adopt
 
05:02:04.760 --> 05:02:06.970 align:start position:0%
in that case the motion is to adopt

the motion passes and the objections to

the motion passes and the objections to
consent

05:04:06.890 --> 05:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
consent
 
05:04:06.900 --> 05:04:07.850 align:start position:0%

none
 
05:04:09.708 --> 05:04:09.718 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none we'll put that on
 
05:04:09.718 --> 05:04:11.810 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none we'll put that on
consent

05:04:11.810 --> 05:04:11.820 align:start position:0%
consent
 
05:04:14.830 --> 05:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 274 that was
 
05:04:16.990 --> 05:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
representative shuitt
 
05:04:19.610 --> 05:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I believe the motion is
 
05:04:20.990 --> 05:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
05:04:23.030 --> 05:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
and I'll make that motion
 
05:04:24.970 --> 05:04:24.980 align:start position:0%
a second
 
05:04:30.110 --> 05:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:33.590 --> 05:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
and the reason we're retaining it is
 
05:04:36.170 --> 05:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
that it's a fairly complicated bill with
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
a major revision to the rulemaking
 
05:04:38.280 --> 05:04:39.770 align:start position:0%
a major revision to the rulemaking
process

05:04:39.770 --> 05:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:04:43.850 --> 05:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
some parts of it are unconstitutional
 
05:04:46.128 --> 05:04:46.138 align:start position:0%
and therefore we're not going to pass it
 
05:04:49.010 --> 05:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
as is but we think we can work on some
 
05:04:54.288 --> 05:04:54.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:56.570 --> 05:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
so retaining it seems like the easiest
 
05:04:58.730 --> 05:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
way to deal with it
 
05:04:58.740 --> 05:05:00.470 align:start position:0%
way to deal with it
any

05:05:00.470 --> 05:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:05:02.510 --> 05:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative grotta do you wish to
 
05:05:04.550 --> 05:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
speak to your second nope it's pretty
 
05:05:08.510 --> 05:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
good okay anybody else want to discuss
 
05:05:08.520 --> 05:05:09.770 align:start position:0%
good okay anybody else want to discuss
it

05:05:09.770 --> 05:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:05:12.050 --> 05:05:12.060 align:start position:0%
okay in that case the motion is to
 
05:05:15.470 --> 05:05:15.480 align:start position:0%

Amendment zero six uh two twenty twenty
 
05:06:37.390 --> 05:06:37.400 align:start position:0%

05:06:41.760 --> 05:06:43.850 align:start position:0%
which I believe you all have somewhere
okay

05:06:43.850 --> 05:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:06:45.708 --> 05:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
and I'll second that
 
05:06:49.610 --> 05:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you I will point out that this
 
05:06:52.910 --> 05:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
amendment is basically the amendment
 
05:06:56.448 --> 05:06:56.458 align:start position:0%
that we had before us uh when we had the
 
05:06:59.330 --> 05:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment hearing the only
 
05:07:03.530 --> 05:07:03.540 align:start position:0%
addition is section 6 because during
 
05:07:06.770 --> 05:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
that hearing it was pointed out by the
 
05:07:09.288 --> 05:07:09.298 align:start position:0%
administrator of the Hillsborough County
 
05:07:12.530 --> 05:07:12.540 align:start position:0%
nursing home that there if you will
 
05:07:15.110 --> 05:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
recall there were many items that
 
05:07:18.110 --> 05:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County has to do to go to
 
05:07:22.610 --> 05:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
bid and unfortunately this one line line
 
05:07:26.270 --> 05:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
30 in this amendment was left out of
 
05:07:29.628 --> 05:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
that Amendment so the new amendment is
 
05:07:31.670 --> 05:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
basically what you saw before adding
 
05:07:35.750 --> 05:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:35.760 --> 05:07:38.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

okay
 
05:07:42.170 --> 05:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
I have nothing to say
 
05:07:42.180 --> 05:07:44.390 align:start position:0%
I have nothing to say
any

05:07:44.390 --> 05:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
any

05:08:56.690 --> 05:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
and the most and uh a motion of ought to
 
05:09:00.050 --> 05:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
pass with amendment is yes I I will make
 
05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
that motion
 
05:09:04.368 --> 05:09:04.378 align:start position:0%
um and just say that the underlying Bill
 
05:09:09.190 --> 05:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 284 which the amendment just
 
05:09:13.010 --> 05:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
adds the language to the underlying Bill
 
05:09:15.708 --> 05:09:15.718 align:start position:0%
we heard if
 
05:09:20.510 --> 05:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
bidding proposal details are made public
 
05:09:23.570 --> 05:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
at times that can
 
05:09:26.030 --> 05:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
how shall I say disadvantage or
 
05:09:30.890 --> 05:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
Advantage people who previously bidded
 
05:09:33.770 --> 05:09:33.780 align:start position:0%
so this language would protect that a
 
05:09:37.150 --> 05:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
little bit so that they can get a fair
 
05:09:40.368 --> 05:09:40.378 align:start position:0%
bidding process if they come back with a
 
05:09:46.368 --> 05:09:46.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:46.378 --> 05:09:50.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:09:50.770 --> 05:09:50.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:54.890 --> 05:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
okay rep second by representative goalie
 
05:10:02.350 --> 05:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:04.910 --> 05:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
replaces the whole building no no the
 
05:10:08.868 --> 05:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
amazing does not replace the whole build
 
05:10:08.878 --> 05:10:11.330 align:start position:0%
amazing does not replace the whole build
sorry

05:10:11.330 --> 05:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:10:14.330 --> 05:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I thought that the
 
05:10:18.670 --> 05:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
the basic Bill clarified that
 
05:10:20.708 --> 05:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
non-confidential information
 
05:10:24.770 --> 05:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
can be revealed in the course of a bit
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
such as
 
05:10:29.330 --> 05:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
we didn't we canceled the the
 
05:10:31.190 --> 05:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
solicitation because all the bids were
 
05:10:34.788 --> 05:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
too high or what this the schedule would
 
05:10:36.890 --> 05:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
be or something like that
 
05:10:40.310 --> 05:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
no information about other bidders or
 
05:10:43.550 --> 05:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
other bids right about the process yes
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
we heard that uh sometimes that could
 
05:10:49.430 --> 05:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
dampen uh competitiveness
 
05:10:49.440 --> 05:10:51.708 align:start position:0%
dampen uh competitiveness
okay

05:10:51.708 --> 05:10:51.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:10:55.850 --> 05:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:55.860 --> 05:10:57.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:10:57.890 --> 05:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:10:59.810 --> 05:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
um in that case the motion is ought to
 
05:11:03.250 --> 05:11:03.260 align:start position:0%
pass with Amendment on House Bill 284
 
05:11:06.050 --> 05:11:06.060 align:start position:0%

05:11:07.788 --> 05:11:07.798 align:start position:0%

legislate on HB 359.
 
05:13:25.730 --> 05:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
is there a second I'll second all right
 
05:13:28.670 --> 05:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
 
05:13:31.190 --> 05:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would be in favor of Ito
 
05:13:34.730 --> 05:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
because it's uh not in perfect alignment
 
05:13:37.250 --> 05:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
with article 10 in that it's just a
 
05:13:38.990 --> 05:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
select group of people that would get
 
05:13:40.430 --> 05:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
this holiday
 
05:13:45.410 --> 05:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:50.208 --> 05:13:50.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:53.390 --> 05:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
although I like the idea and concept I
 
05:13:55.010 --> 05:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
don't think it's practical
 
05:14:01.670 --> 05:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:05.208 --> 05:14:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:09.350 --> 05:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I'm opposed the idea the
 
05:14:13.010 --> 05:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
election is in fact election day is in
 
05:14:15.948 --> 05:14:15.958 align:start position:0%
fact a legal holiday but
 
05:14:18.590 --> 05:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know who it doesn't matter who
 
05:14:20.810 --> 05:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
gets it off because
 
05:14:23.628 --> 05:14:23.638 align:start position:0%
most of us are
 
05:14:27.170 --> 05:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
busy going going out to vote for it so I
 
05:14:29.628 --> 05:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
don't see that adding the presidential
 
05:14:32.690 --> 05:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
primary or the general primary as
 
05:14:34.670 --> 05:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
holidays would have any effect
 
05:14:34.680 --> 05:14:37.070 align:start position:0%
holidays would have any effect
whatsoever

05:14:37.070 --> 05:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
05:14:40.788 --> 05:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
Sam Gerhard thank you at least well not
 
05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
least the last paragraph though all
 
05:14:44.690 --> 05:14:44.700 align:start position:0%
other employers shall when practicable
 
05:14:46.550 --> 05:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
allow employees up to three hours away
 
05:14:48.590 --> 05:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
from work to cast ballots it just seems
 
05:14:50.510 --> 05:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
kind of odd shall is enforcement thing
 
05:14:52.730 --> 05:14:52.740 align:start position:0%
you have to but who's enforcing that and
 
05:14:54.530 --> 05:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
how it just yeah so I'm agree with with
 
05:14:56.750 --> 05:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
you I just find it kind of
 
05:15:00.050 --> 05:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
sketchy okay
 
05:15:03.288 --> 05:15:03.298 align:start position:0%
all right any further discussion
 
05:15:05.750 --> 05:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none in that case emotion is an
 
05:15:07.610 --> 05:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
experience to legislate on House Bill
 
05:15:10.670 --> 05:15:10.680 align:start position:0%

that motion passes 20-0 is there any
 
05:15:59.330 --> 05:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
objection to consent
 
05:16:01.070 --> 05:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none we'll put that on
 
05:16:01.080 --> 05:16:02.990 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none we'll put that on
consent

05:16:02.990 --> 05:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
consent
 
05:16:06.410 --> 05:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
House Bill 457 we will
 
05:16:08.990 --> 05:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
defer until Friday
 
05:16:13.670 --> 05:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 461 representative Simon
 
05:16:14.930 --> 05:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I would like to
 
05:16:18.670 --> 05:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
2023-0782h second okay
 
05:16:25.550 --> 05:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion uh
 
05:16:27.170 --> 05:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
05:16:28.850 --> 05:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
um so essentially what the amendment to
 
05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it uh reduces the
 
05:16:32.628 --> 05:16:32.638 align:start position:0%
amount of people who could have been
 
05:16:35.230 --> 05:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
affected by the original legislation to
 
05:16:37.550 --> 05:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
high-level employees in both group one
 
05:16:39.170 --> 05:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
and group two of the retirement system
 
05:16:41.470 --> 05:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
so Fire Chiefs police Chiefs
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
superintendents principals uh positions
 
05:16:47.150 --> 05:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
of the like and what it does is if a
 
05:16:49.788 --> 05:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
municipality decides to move a full-time
 
05:16:51.590 --> 05:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
person in one of those positions down to
 
05:16:54.970 --> 05:16:54.980 align:start position:0%
a part-time position in order to avoid
 
05:16:57.410 --> 05:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
spreading costs to other municipalities
 
05:16:58.610 --> 05:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
because they're no longer paying into
 
05:17:00.250 --> 05:17:00.260 align:start position:0%
the retirement system
 
05:17:02.330 --> 05:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
it basically
 
05:17:05.930 --> 05:17:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh and it basically requires that the
 
05:17:07.610 --> 05:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
municipality continue to pay the ual
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
portion of that position as determined
 
05:17:12.470 --> 05:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
over the average of the last few years
 
05:17:14.990 --> 05:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
and then uh 20 percent
 
05:17:17.510 --> 05:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
penalty on top of it that would stay in
 
05:17:20.510 --> 05:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
effect for 15 years or until the
 
05:17:22.368 --> 05:17:22.378 align:start position:0%
position was reinstated to a full-time
 
05:17:22.378 --> 05:17:24.170 align:start position:0%
position was reinstated to a full-time
position

05:17:24.170 --> 05:17:24.180 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:17:27.650 --> 05:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:29.510 --> 05:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
and so it seems like a pretty Common
 
05:17:32.330 --> 05:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
Sense measure to me uh to keep
 
05:17:33.770 --> 05:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
municipalities from making decisions
 
05:17:36.230 --> 05:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
that is basically going to force higher
 
05:17:38.270 --> 05:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
expenses onto other municipalities the
 
05:17:41.570 --> 05:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
amendment number again it is zero seven
 
05:17:43.490 --> 05:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
eight two
 
05:17:45.288 --> 05:17:45.298 align:start position:0%
okay representative Schmidt do you wish
 
05:17:46.850 --> 05:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
to speak to your second
 
05:17:50.448 --> 05:17:50.458 align:start position:0%
this is a practice which is unfair uh to
 
05:17:52.670 --> 05:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
all the other communities in in the
 
05:17:55.970 --> 05:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
State uh and therefore uh and harmful to
 
05:17:59.990 --> 05:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
the uh uaal situation as well so uh we
 
05:18:02.208 --> 05:18:02.218 align:start position:0%
don't want to let this spread so I'm
 
05:18:05.750 --> 05:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
supportive of the bill as amended with
 
05:18:05.760 --> 05:18:06.830 align:start position:0%
supportive of the bill as amended with
Amendment

05:18:06.830 --> 05:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:18:09.190 --> 05:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
other uh
 
05:18:11.628 --> 05:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
their comments
 
05:18:13.970 --> 05:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say that that I've seen it
 
05:18:18.288 --> 05:18:18.298 align:start position:0%
happen and it's it's done by
 
05:18:20.628 --> 05:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
well in some cases
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
the town may feel that they've got a
 
05:18:25.550 --> 05:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
superior person that they that thinks he
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
can do it but it's very difficult to
 
05:18:31.730 --> 05:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
realistically say you're replacing a
 
05:18:35.330 --> 05:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
full-time superintendent or police chief
 
05:18:38.330 --> 05:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
or a director of of your city operations
 
05:18:41.030 --> 05:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
with a part-time position
 
05:18:41.040 --> 05:18:42.350 align:start position:0%
with a part-time position
it's

05:18:42.350 --> 05:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:18:44.750 --> 05:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
particularly with the Limited hours that
 
05:18:49.910 --> 05:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
retirees from our our Lim are limited to
 
05:18:51.948 --> 05:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
there's just no way that you can do the
 
05:18:54.410 --> 05:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
job in that little time
 
05:18:58.010 --> 05:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
without violating the
 
05:18:58.020 --> 05:18:59.690 align:start position:0%
without violating the
your

05:18:59.690 --> 05:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:19:03.830 --> 05:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
limits on hours and it's
 
05:19:06.590 --> 05:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's unfair to other towns and it's
 
05:19:10.310 --> 05:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
unfair to the people of that town when
 
05:19:13.850 --> 05:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
the the high level persons coming back
 
05:19:15.410 --> 05:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
from retirement
 
05:19:19.208 --> 05:19:19.218 align:start position:0%
is unable to
 
05:19:22.250 --> 05:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
fully perform the job within the hours
 
05:19:24.590 --> 05:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to work
 
05:19:24.600 --> 05:19:25.910 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to work
so

05:19:25.910 --> 05:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:19:30.050 --> 05:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
this closes a loophole that in some
 
05:19:32.868 --> 05:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
cases towns have said that well it's
 
05:19:35.090 --> 05:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
cheaper we don't you know we only have
 
05:19:37.310 --> 05:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
to give them a part-time salary with no
 
05:19:38.868 --> 05:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
benefits so they don't have to pay into
 
05:19:38.878 --> 05:19:40.310 align:start position:0%
benefits so they don't have to pay into
retirement

05:19:40.310 --> 05:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
05:19:40.320 --> 05:19:42.670 align:start position:0%
retirement
and

05:19:42.670 --> 05:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:19:45.708 --> 05:19:45.718 align:start position:0%
however advantageous that seems to be
 
05:19:49.430 --> 05:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
for one town it is not advantageous for
 
05:19:53.708 --> 05:19:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:58.610 --> 05:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
I agree and uh you know even if it it is
 
05:20:01.010 --> 05:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
workable for them to come part-time we
 
05:20:02.628 --> 05:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
should remove the incentive for them to
 
05:20:03.770 --> 05:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
do so and then they can make that
 
05:20:05.570 --> 05:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
decision based on the merits not trying
 
05:20:08.330 --> 05:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
to save pain into the uaal
 
05:20:11.090 --> 05:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
good point all right
 
05:20:12.948 --> 05:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:20:15.110 --> 05:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt well one of the
 
05:20:16.730 --> 05:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
aspects is when you're in a top position
 
05:20:18.770 --> 05:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
like this ordinarily you're expected to
 
05:20:21.830 --> 05:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
work independent of the clock and to be
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
available on a virtually full-time basis
 
05:20:26.990 --> 05:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
whenever you're needed because you are
 
05:20:28.190 --> 05:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
the top dog
 
05:20:30.708 --> 05:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
okay now to put that person into a
 
05:20:32.690 --> 05:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
part-time situation where they're
 
05:20:36.170 --> 05:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
expected to work less is a contradiction
 
05:20:38.810 --> 05:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
in terms of what people have a right to
 
05:20:46.190 --> 05:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:48.708 --> 05:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
seeing none the motion is to adopt
 
05:20:55.490 --> 05:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:58.010 --> 05:20:58.020 align:start position:0%

just speak to your motion uh yes please
 
05:23:35.150 --> 05:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh so this bill strengthens uh State
 
05:23:37.490 --> 05:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
Licensing compliance uh For Occupational
 
05:23:38.990 --> 05:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
licensing uh while avoiding
 
05:23:41.090 --> 05:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
protectionism and allows voluntary
 
05:23:43.490 --> 05:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
interaction between individuals uh
 
05:23:44.990 --> 05:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
deletes the penalties for operating
 
05:23:47.868 --> 05:23:47.878 align:start position:0%
without an occupational license and uh
 
05:23:49.610 --> 05:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
prohibits people to be holding
 
05:23:52.010 --> 05:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
themselves out to be licensed therefore
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
slipping the incentive from concealing
 
05:23:56.410 --> 05:23:56.420 align:start position:0%
your unlicensed status to to wanting to
 
05:24:00.410 --> 05:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
unconceal that and uh Market forces just
 
05:24:02.930 --> 05:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
like they do now will continue to uh
 
05:24:04.610 --> 05:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
Mark Force like insurance for example
 
05:24:06.830 --> 05:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
will still demand occupational licensing
 
05:24:09.050 --> 05:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
especially in fields like medical
 
05:24:09.060 --> 05:24:10.570 align:start position:0%
especially in fields like medical
construction

05:24:10.570 --> 05:24:10.580 align:start position:0%
construction
 
05:24:12.948 --> 05:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons they do now you
 
05:24:14.330 --> 05:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
can't get insurance policy if you have
 
05:24:16.670 --> 05:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
unlicensed people on staff
 
05:24:21.590 --> 05:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:24.830 --> 05:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative wish to
 
05:24:26.990 --> 05:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion I do
 
05:24:28.730 --> 05:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
um in addition to those
 
05:24:30.050 --> 05:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
um you know there's
 
05:24:32.690 --> 05:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
attempts or arguments for uh
 
05:24:34.730 --> 05:24:34.740 align:start position:0%
removing certain licenses this actually
 
05:24:36.410 --> 05:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
involves some of the complications it
 
05:24:38.030 --> 05:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
leaves them in place if people need them
 
05:24:40.368 --> 05:24:40.378 align:start position:0%
for some reason or want them or they
 
05:24:42.288 --> 05:24:42.298 align:start position:0%
think that their customers would prefer
 
05:24:44.750 --> 05:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
them they're available
 
05:24:47.510 --> 05:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and um if they don't they don't
 
05:24:49.850 --> 05:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
I know when I go to look for a doctor
 
05:24:51.948 --> 05:24:51.958 align:start position:0%
for example I do quite a bit of
 
05:24:54.470 --> 05:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
searching online and I may look and see
 
05:24:56.150 --> 05:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
what certifications they have and they
 
05:24:57.650 --> 05:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
have the things on the wall and what
 
05:24:59.750 --> 05:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
medical schools have gone to they care a
 
05:25:01.250 --> 05:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
lot more about that sort of thing than I
 
05:25:03.590 --> 05:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
do about some state license and that's
 
05:25:04.788 --> 05:25:04.798 align:start position:0%
true for
 
05:25:08.868 --> 05:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:13.750 --> 05:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:16.670 --> 05:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting against the igl motion
 
05:25:19.670 --> 05:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
although it sounds like
 
05:25:22.788 --> 05:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm sorry I'm so sorry it's been
 
05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know what's my it's been too
 
05:25:26.330 --> 05:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
long of a day for me I'm sorry I'll be
 
05:25:28.730 --> 05:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
voting against the OTP motion thank you
 
05:25:28.740 --> 05:25:29.810 align:start position:0%
voting against the OTP motion thank you
because

05:25:29.810 --> 05:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:25:29.820 --> 05:25:30.830 align:start position:0%
because
um

05:25:30.830 --> 05:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:30.840 --> 05:25:32.868 align:start position:0%
um
although

05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
although
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
um I can understand people's
 
05:25:40.850 --> 05:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
motives and um to um in how they operate
 
05:25:42.470 --> 05:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
we have to remember that we're
 
05:25:44.448 --> 05:25:44.458 align:start position:0%
representing the people of New Hampshire
 
05:25:48.350 --> 05:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
and I feel that the there's been a lot
 
05:25:52.010 --> 05:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
of discussion on licensing as will be
 
05:25:55.010 --> 05:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
evident later on this afternoon and I
 
05:25:56.510 --> 05:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
feel that if we want to look at
 
05:25:59.750 --> 05:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
licensing and regulations and
 
05:26:02.690 --> 05:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
certifications we should look at them in
 
05:26:05.570 --> 05:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
relation to the industry that they're
 
05:26:08.510 --> 05:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
related to and not across the board like
 
05:26:10.430 --> 05:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
this thank you okay thank you
 
05:26:12.410 --> 05:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard thank you madam
 
05:26:12.420 --> 05:26:13.368 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard thank you madam
chair

05:26:13.368 --> 05:26:13.378 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:26:15.590 --> 05:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
I'm supporting this
 
05:26:18.590 --> 05:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
for the reason that the recent well the
 
05:26:20.150 --> 05:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
recent events with covid have
 
05:26:22.368 --> 05:26:22.378 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that
 
05:26:22.378 --> 05:26:23.770 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that
their

05:26:23.770 --> 05:26:23.780 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:26:26.510 --> 05:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
certain elements have been captured by
 
05:26:28.190 --> 05:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
the the people that they should be
 
05:26:30.590 --> 05:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
regulating and I'm specific specifically
 
05:26:32.030 --> 05:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
talking about the medical industry where
 
05:26:33.470 --> 05:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
you had doctors and nurses that were
 
05:26:34.670 --> 05:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
prescribing treatments that were not
 
05:26:37.190 --> 05:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
authorized by the bought and paid for
 
05:26:39.288 --> 05:26:39.298 align:start position:0%
entities and they were threatened with
 
05:26:41.150 --> 05:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
revocation of their ability to earn a
 
05:26:42.890 --> 05:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
living and pay to pay their rent
 
05:26:45.230 --> 05:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
mortgage whatever and I just think it's
 
05:26:46.788 --> 05:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
dangerous and I don't think that's a
 
05:26:48.948 --> 05:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
good precedent to maintain so I believe
 
05:26:51.110 --> 05:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
that people should be held
 
05:26:52.550 --> 05:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
or should people should have the ability
 
05:26:54.470 --> 05:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
to go to the service provider they
 
05:26:56.448 --> 05:26:56.458 align:start position:0%
choose to go to so long as Matt was
 
05:26:58.610 --> 05:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
saying the representative sentence was
 
05:27:00.530 --> 05:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
saying that they do not hold themselves
 
05:27:03.110 --> 05:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
out to be licensed by the state
 
05:27:05.090 --> 05:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
so personal responsibility individual
 
05:27:11.330 --> 05:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:13.070 --> 05:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
what to pass by representative San
 
05:27:13.080 --> 05:27:14.330 align:start position:0%

05:28:27.470 --> 05:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
a second
 
05:28:30.948 --> 05:28:30.958 align:start position:0%
second there's some goalie seconds all
 
05:28:30.958 --> 05:28:32.090 align:start position:0%
second there's some goalie seconds all
right

05:28:32.090 --> 05:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:28:32.100 --> 05:28:34.070 align:start position:0%
right
um

05:28:34.070 --> 05:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:38.448 --> 05:28:38.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:40.368 --> 05:28:40.378 align:start position:0%
all right in that case the motion is
 
05:28:43.070 --> 05:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
inexping to legislate on House Bill 507
 
05:28:45.590 --> 05:28:45.600 align:start position:0%

all right that motion also fails on a 10
 
05:29:40.850 --> 05:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
on a tie therefore it will go with no
 
05:29:43.550 --> 05:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation representative Santo
 
05:29:46.190 --> 05:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
nastasso will write oh actually has
 
05:29:49.190 --> 05:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
written the report for ought to pass uh
 
05:29:52.670 --> 05:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
represent Broder you'll write for an itl
 
05:29:52.680 --> 05:29:56.208 align:start position:0%
represent Broder you'll write for an itl
okay

05:29:56.208 --> 05:29:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:58.670 --> 05:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
incidentally I would like to very much
 
05:30:01.550 --> 05:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank representative Santo nastasso and
 
05:30:03.470 --> 05:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
the other people who sent in their
 
05:30:06.350 --> 05:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
committee reports prior to the to the
 
05:30:08.628 --> 05:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
meeting so we're way ahead of schedule
 
05:30:15.830 --> 05:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:19.610 --> 05:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
House Bill 339 representative groder you
 
05:30:22.850 --> 05:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:24.650 --> 05:30:24.660 align:start position:0%
oh is this the uh the wonder who they
 
05:30:27.110 --> 05:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
heard this morning yes it is yes I move
 
05:30:29.750 --> 05:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
itl and house bill 339.
 
05:30:32.930 --> 05:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:36.250 --> 05:30:36.260 align:start position:0%
second okay by representative
 
05:30:38.750 --> 05:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative lacques
 
05:30:42.830 --> 05:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:45.288 --> 05:30:45.298 align:start position:0%
if I don't have to I'd rather not speak
 
05:30:46.730 --> 05:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
to emotion
 
05:30:48.830 --> 05:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
because I think based on the testimony
 
05:30:50.750 --> 05:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's self-evident why the Bills should
 
05:30:52.368 --> 05:30:52.378 align:start position:0%
be ideals
 
05:30:58.670 --> 05:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:01.368 --> 05:31:01.378 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
05:31:03.170 --> 05:31:03.180 align:start position:0%
let me just take that back I feel like
 
05:31:04.550 --> 05:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
this morning we've heard we heard enough
 
05:31:06.890 --> 05:31:06.900 align:start position:0%
about the subject that's that's why I'm
 
05:31:10.490 --> 05:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:10.500 --> 05:31:12.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:31:12.530 --> 05:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:31:15.708 --> 05:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
I would have to uh agree with you
 
05:31:20.690 --> 05:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:23.090 --> 05:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
actually I do yes representative Gerhard
 
05:31:24.830 --> 05:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:31:28.070 --> 05:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
I will be voting itl on this as well and
 
05:31:29.930 --> 05:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
I just want to
 
05:31:33.230 --> 05:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
kind of elucidate my reasons for that
 
05:31:34.990 --> 05:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
and one of the
 
05:31:37.190 --> 05:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
members of public that satisfied earlier
 
05:31:40.550 --> 05:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
talked about the incident in 1967 where
 
05:31:43.128 --> 05:31:43.138 align:start position:0%
Israel attacked the USS Liberty
 
05:31:46.128 --> 05:31:46.138 align:start position:0%
34 Sailors were killed 173 were wounded
 
05:31:47.690 --> 05:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
in action and there's been no
 
05:31:49.430 --> 05:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
investigation of this that was
 
05:31:51.948 --> 05:31:51.958 align:start position:0%
legitimate so I just feel that there are
 
05:31:53.930 --> 05:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
reasons that people are boycotting and I
 
05:31:55.788 --> 05:31:55.798 align:start position:0%
don't think it's for some kind of
 
05:31:57.288 --> 05:31:57.298 align:start position:0%
obscure reasons they actually have
 
05:31:58.550 --> 05:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons and I think we should
 
05:32:00.708 --> 05:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
respect that and not
 
05:32:02.750 --> 05:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
keep the state from investing in these
 
05:32:07.550 --> 05:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:09.470 --> 05:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
well the interest of fair disclosure
 
05:32:11.330 --> 05:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
I'll say that not only do I have
 
05:32:14.090 --> 05:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
relatives in Israel I've invested in a
 
05:32:16.010 --> 05:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
number of Israeli companies
 
05:32:16.020 --> 05:32:17.510 align:start position:0%
number of Israeli companies
and

05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:32:20.990 --> 05:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
and I still support the itl because I
 
05:32:22.610 --> 05:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
believe that we should not
 
05:32:26.330 --> 05:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
tie the hands of our retirement system
 
05:32:26.340 --> 05:32:28.610 align:start position:0%
tie the hands of our retirement system
with

05:32:28.610 --> 05:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:32:31.850 --> 05:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
political agendas however much we may
 
05:32:33.230 --> 05:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
support them
 
05:32:35.750 --> 05:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative I agree with that and
 
05:32:37.128 --> 05:32:37.138 align:start position:0%
just briefly
 
05:32:39.170 --> 05:32:39.180 align:start position:0%
um it's a bad precedent to set because
 
05:32:41.030 --> 05:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
there are many different potential
 
05:32:42.830 --> 05:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
political agendas that people might want
 
05:32:44.690 --> 05:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
to influence the investment and the
 
05:32:46.310 --> 05:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
other thing is that putting constraints
 
05:32:49.490 --> 05:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
on them may reduce the return and even
 
05:32:51.590 --> 05:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
every small bit of reduction in Return
 
05:32:54.230 --> 05:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
of the pension system is costing just
 
05:32:55.788 --> 05:32:55.798 align:start position:0%
about every taxpayer in the state money
 
05:32:59.690 --> 05:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:02.390 --> 05:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:33:02.400 --> 05:33:03.770 align:start position:0%
anyone else
okay

05:33:03.770 --> 05:33:03.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:33:06.050 --> 05:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
in that case the motion is inexpedient
 
05:33:09.530 --> 05:33:09.540 align:start position:0%
to legislate on House Bill 339 and the
 
05:33:11.810 --> 05:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
clerk can call the roll
 
05:33:14.810 --> 05:33:14.820 align:start position:0%

representative Gould yes
 
05:34:05.510 --> 05:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:05.520 --> 05:34:08.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:34:08.510 --> 05:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:11.208 --> 05:34:11.218 align:start position:0%
15 yay 5 nay
 
05:34:14.390 --> 05:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
all right the motion passes 15 to 5 that
 
05:34:16.490 --> 05:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
will be on the regular calendar
 
05:34:19.128 --> 05:34:19.138 align:start position:0%
is anyone interested in writing a
 
05:34:23.448 --> 05:34:23.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:25.730 --> 05:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
okay representative a bear will write a
 
05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:36.958 --> 05:34:39.708 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:34:39.708 --> 05:34:39.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:34:43.250 --> 05:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
House Bill 518 Jackie that emotion I do
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm chair I'd like to retain house
 
05:34:47.330 --> 05:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
bill 518.
 
05:34:50.330 --> 05:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
I'll second that
 
05:34:52.850 --> 05:34:52.860 align:start position:0%
you would just speak to your motion
 
05:34:55.070 --> 05:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
yes I think that um
 
05:34:58.310 --> 05:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
this is a one of these um bills that you
 
05:35:00.110 --> 05:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
need a little bit more attention and we
 
05:35:02.150 --> 05:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
should certainly spend some time looking
 
05:35:06.170 --> 05:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:09.430 --> 05:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say that it addresses the
 
05:35:13.430 --> 05:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
idea of regulation of licensed
 
05:35:16.490 --> 05:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
occupations and we have a couple of
 
05:35:16.500 --> 05:35:17.990 align:start position:0%
occupations and we have a couple of
major

05:35:17.990 --> 05:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
major
 
05:35:22.310 --> 05:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
major bills that we're looking at that
 
05:35:24.590 --> 05:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
we obviously have not
 
05:35:27.230 --> 05:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
looked at as thoroughly as we might like
 
05:35:30.890 --> 05:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
in some areas and this bill could very
 
05:35:34.970 --> 05:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
legitimately be amended to address some
 
05:35:37.128 --> 05:35:37.138 align:start position:0%
of these revisions that were
 
05:35:38.990 --> 05:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
really haven't had the time to do right
 
05:35:39.000 --> 05:35:42.230 align:start position:0%
really haven't had the time to do right
now

05:35:42.230 --> 05:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:46.490 --> 05:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:46.500 --> 05:35:48.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:35:48.350 --> 05:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:35:50.628 --> 05:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
in that case the motion is to retain
 
05:35:53.868 --> 05:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
House Bill 518 and the clerk can call
 
05:35:55.610 --> 05:35:55.620 align:start position:0%
the role
 
05:35:58.250 --> 05:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative Simon yes representative
 
05:36:01.368 --> 05:36:01.378 align:start position:0%
Lakers yes representative Bailey yes
 
05:36:03.770 --> 05:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
representative Santo nastasso yes

yes I was thinking very hard at him I
didn't

05:36:54.948 --> 05:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
05:36:57.110 --> 05:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:37:01.128 --> 05:37:01.138 align:start position:0%
okay House Bill 532 representative a bar
 
05:37:03.410 --> 05:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
you have a motion
 
05:37:05.448 --> 05:37:05.458 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:37:09.230 --> 05:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
I would like a motion to kill I'm sorry
 
05:37:14.628 --> 05:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
itl HB 532 FN
 
05:37:17.830 --> 05:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
and I'll second all right sorry
 
05:37:20.810 --> 05:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
thank you we're moved by representative
 
05:37:22.970 --> 05:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
second of everything like us you should
 
05:37:24.470 --> 05:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
05:37:27.170 --> 05:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
I would thank you madam chair
 
05:37:30.708 --> 05:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
in subcommittee I supported this and I
 
05:37:33.230 --> 05:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
went home that weekend and I tossed and
 
05:37:35.628 --> 05:37:35.638 align:start position:0%
turned on this forever
 
05:37:38.330 --> 05:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
and the the main reason why I supported
 
05:37:40.190 --> 05:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
it is because I'm pro-business I made
 
05:37:41.628 --> 05:37:41.638 align:start position:0%
that very clear
 
05:37:43.730 --> 05:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
however I think that we're using
 
05:37:46.788 --> 05:37:46.798 align:start position:0%
Licensing in a different way here as
 
05:37:49.310 --> 05:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
well as setting a precedent for other
 
05:37:52.368 --> 05:37:52.378 align:start position:0%
Industries to say well I want to be
 
05:37:54.110 --> 05:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
licensed so that I can obtain insurance
 
05:37:57.948 --> 05:37:57.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's not the way that we use
 
05:37:59.990 --> 05:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
Licensing in New Hampshire
 
05:38:02.570 --> 05:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
also with the pending bills coming at us
 
05:38:04.430 --> 05:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
with licensing
 
05:38:04.440 --> 05:38:06.530 align:start position:0%
with licensing
it's

05:38:06.530 --> 05:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:38:09.288 --> 05:38:09.298 align:start position:0%
most likely the insurance companies are
 
05:38:11.090 --> 05:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
going to start to
 
05:38:13.310 --> 05:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
require certification instead of
 
05:38:15.890 --> 05:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
Licensing is is where I think this is
 
05:38:15.900 --> 05:38:16.788 align:start position:0%
Licensing is is where I think this is
going

05:38:16.788 --> 05:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
going
 
05:38:16.798 --> 05:38:18.230 align:start position:0%
going
so

05:38:18.230 --> 05:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:38:21.170 --> 05:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
that is my motion thank you
 
05:38:22.970 --> 05:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative do you have anything to
 
05:38:22.980 --> 05:38:24.288 align:start position:0%
representative do you have anything to
add

05:38:24.288 --> 05:38:24.298 align:start position:0%
add
 
05:38:25.970 --> 05:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
um I agree and the only other thing I'll
 
05:38:28.430 --> 05:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
say is that I think the only legitimate
 
05:38:30.530 --> 05:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
reason for occupational licensing and I
 
05:38:32.270 --> 05:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
believe this is in statute
 
05:38:36.650 --> 05:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
is related to health and safety and uh
 
05:38:38.330 --> 05:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
from that's not the case really here I
 
05:38:40.430 --> 05:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
mean we had a little bit of testimony on
 
05:38:43.190 --> 05:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
that but I think the uh the bar for
 
05:38:44.990 --> 05:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
health and safety to require licensing
 
05:38:47.390 --> 05:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
is much much higher than applies in this
 
05:38:47.400 --> 05:38:50.750 align:start position:0%
is much much higher than applies in this
case

05:38:50.750 --> 05:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:53.690 --> 05:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:58.868 --> 05:38:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:01.850 --> 05:39:01.860 align:start position:0%
I wanted to say I am going to
 
05:39:01.860 --> 05:39:02.690 align:start position:0%
I wanted to say I am going to
um

05:39:02.690 --> 05:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:05.628 --> 05:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
vote against the ideal motion I think
 
05:39:07.368 --> 05:39:07.378 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:39:10.310 --> 05:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
the there is tremendous benefit to be
 
05:39:13.310 --> 05:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
gained by the um
 
05:39:16.128 --> 05:39:16.138 align:start position:0%
by this practice and especially we heard
 
05:39:18.590 --> 05:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
from those individuals who have been
 
05:39:20.090 --> 05:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
affected from
 
05:39:23.750 --> 05:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
being in uh in on the front and there's
 
05:39:25.628 --> 05:39:25.638 align:start position:0%
the benefits to the veteran vets
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
veterans which I think is very important
 
05:39:31.550 --> 05:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that it's up to us to
 
05:39:34.070 --> 05:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
decide how hard how high the bar should
 
05:39:36.170 --> 05:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
be when it comes to the benefits when we
 
05:39:39.890 --> 05:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
ourselves do not recognize the benefit
 
05:39:42.830 --> 05:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
um and I also think that the music
 
05:39:44.628 --> 05:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
therapist and the speech pathologists
 
05:39:46.368 --> 05:39:46.378 align:start position:0%
have been working together
 
05:39:49.368 --> 05:39:49.378 align:start position:0%
in Earnest to get this bill to where it
 
05:39:52.970 --> 05:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
is and therefore I think that that and
 
05:39:56.110 --> 05:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
Licensing is how you get insurance
 
05:39:59.628 --> 05:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
reimbursement in New Hampshire so I
 
05:40:01.430 --> 05:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
think that this is
 
05:40:04.190 --> 05:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
um a bill that deserves
 
05:40:04.200 --> 05:40:04.788 align:start position:0%
um a bill that deserves
um

05:40:04.788 --> 05:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:07.310 --> 05:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
to be brought to the floor
 
05:40:09.590 --> 05:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
and I'll be voting against the itl
 
05:40:09.600 --> 05:40:11.150 align:start position:0%
and I'll be voting against the itl
motion

05:40:11.150 --> 05:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
motion
 
05:40:13.910 --> 05:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
05:40:16.310 --> 05:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I too will be
 
05:40:18.470 --> 05:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
voting against the motion of inexperiod
 
05:40:20.930 --> 05:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
05:40:23.330 --> 05:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
we were all most of us were here for the
 
05:40:26.270 --> 05:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
public hearing and heard how
 
05:40:26.280 --> 05:40:27.830 align:start position:0%
public hearing and heard how
this

05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:40:30.948 --> 05:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
is a different type
 
05:40:33.890 --> 05:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
of treatment that affects people in
 
05:40:37.070 --> 05:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
different ways helps some people a lot
 
05:40:41.448 --> 05:40:41.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:45.050 --> 05:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
and the problem that bothered me was
 
05:40:48.350 --> 05:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
a number of individuals had to pay out
 
05:40:50.570 --> 05:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
of pocket for this
 
05:40:53.868 --> 05:40:53.878 align:start position:0%
and when I look at veterans with PTSD or
 
05:40:55.490 --> 05:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
whatever they may have and this is a way
 
05:40:58.010 --> 05:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
of helping in a form of treatment and
 
05:40:59.570 --> 05:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
these individuals are paying out of
 
05:41:02.690 --> 05:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
their pocket bothers me
 
05:41:04.570 --> 05:41:04.580 align:start position:0%
and if we can do something to help
 
05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
especially at a time not only with PTSD
 
05:41:10.310 --> 05:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
or any of that at a time when there is a
 
05:41:12.948 --> 05:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis in this country and
 
05:41:15.310 --> 05:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
then this is another form of treatment
 
05:41:17.990 --> 05:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
addressing that issue and we've heard
 
05:41:20.270 --> 05:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
time and time again that this should be
 
05:41:23.650 --> 05:41:23.660 align:start position:0%
an all hand Hands-On deck to help treat
 
05:41:26.270 --> 05:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
Mental Health
 
05:41:29.150 --> 05:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
that I cannot support in expedient to
 
05:41:30.770 --> 05:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
legislate this is another tool in the
 
05:41:34.010 --> 05:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
toolbox and I think it's important to
 
05:41:36.530 --> 05:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
have that available and paid for and
 
05:41:39.050 --> 05:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
covered so I will go against the Ito
 
05:41:42.410 --> 05:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative Schmidt
 
05:41:44.750 --> 05:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and while they say
 
05:41:48.350 --> 05:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
mu the hath charms to soothe the Savage
 
05:41:54.310 --> 05:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:57.830 --> 05:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
there are as a common recognition that
 
05:42:00.788 --> 05:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
music has a strong impact on people
 
05:42:04.010 --> 05:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
it can fire you up it can calm you down
 
05:42:06.470 --> 05:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
or whatever but that doesn't mean that
 
05:42:08.868 --> 05:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
you can be a therapist just by playing a
 
05:42:08.878 --> 05:42:09.850 align:start position:0%
you can be a therapist just by playing a
record

05:42:09.850 --> 05:42:09.860 align:start position:0%
record
 
05:42:12.530 --> 05:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
and are playing an instrument for that
 
05:42:14.030 --> 05:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
matter although that probably is even
 
05:42:16.850 --> 05:42:16.860 align:start position:0%
more soothing to some people depending
 
05:42:18.010 --> 05:42:18.020 align:start position:0%
on the instrument
 
05:42:21.410 --> 05:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
so the the other important reality is
 
05:42:23.990 --> 05:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
this bill already passed the house
 
05:42:28.070 --> 05:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
pass this committee passed uh I think it
 
05:42:30.770 --> 05:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
passed the Commerce Committee as well uh
 
05:42:32.868 --> 05:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
passed the house and would probably be
 
05:42:36.110 --> 05:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
in law right now the pandemic hadn't uh
 
05:42:39.170 --> 05:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
killed off the process in the Senate uh
 
05:42:41.170 --> 05:42:41.180 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
05:42:43.850 --> 05:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
we know that there are successful
 
05:42:46.190 --> 05:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
businesses out there who are continuing
 
05:42:49.610 --> 05:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
but they're struggling uh because uh
 
05:42:49.620 --> 05:42:50.990 align:start position:0%
but they're struggling uh because uh
they

05:42:50.990 --> 05:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:42:54.708 --> 05:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
are not compensatable by insurance
 
05:42:57.530 --> 05:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
simple matter the insurance doesn't say
 
05:42:59.810 --> 05:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
you're bogus it just says you're not
 
05:43:03.530 --> 05:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
licensed and so that's very unfair and
 
05:43:07.128 --> 05:43:07.138 align:start position:0%
we're depriving our citizens of the kind
 
05:43:11.590 --> 05:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
of treatment that other Sciences provide
 
05:43:15.650 --> 05:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
for the simple music reason of uh of uh
 
05:43:18.050 --> 05:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
not being covered by insurance and they
 
05:43:20.030 --> 05:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
can't afford it otherwise
 
05:43:22.250 --> 05:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
so at any rate
 
05:43:24.530 --> 05:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
so I will also be voting against the
 
05:43:24.540 --> 05:43:27.170 align:start position:0%
so I will also be voting against the
ideal

05:43:27.170 --> 05:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:30.830 --> 05:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
I said I'm sure thank you madam chair I
 
05:43:33.708 --> 05:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
heard in committee that there are 48
 
05:43:36.708 --> 05:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
music therapists in the state
 
05:43:40.310 --> 05:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
and I cannot support a bill that is
 
05:43:44.208 --> 05:43:44.218 align:start position:0%
written for a minuscule number of people
 
05:43:46.190 --> 05:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:48.650 --> 05:43:48.660 align:start position:0%

05:43:48.660 --> 05:43:50.628 align:start position:0%

05:47:11.570 --> 05:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
yes yes that is an amendment that I
 
05:47:16.628 --> 05:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:20.628 --> 05:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
it was referenced earlier that she would
 
05:47:23.570 --> 05:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
come up with the amendment
 
05:47:26.510 --> 05:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
just just reminding everybody else but
 
05:47:28.910 --> 05:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative bleckis okay was recalled
 
05:47:31.430 --> 05:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:35.090 --> 05:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:39.230 --> 05:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:39.240 --> 05:47:40.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:47:40.788 --> 05:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:42.288 --> 05:47:42.298 align:start position:0%
do you want to take a break for a few
 
05:47:43.970 --> 05:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
minutes while he gets it or do you want
 
05:47:48.890 --> 05:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:50.930 --> 05:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
yeah let's go to 350 if that's okay with
 
05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:58.910 --> 05:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to move ought to pass with
 
05:47:58.920 --> 05:48:00.410 align:start position:0%
I'm going to move ought to pass with
Amendment

05:48:00.410 --> 05:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:48:00.420 --> 05:48:06.170 align:start position:0%
Amendment
0-400648

05:48:06.170 --> 05:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:10.430 --> 05:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:15.010 --> 05:48:15.020 align:start position:0%
and I will mention that the amendment
 
05:48:17.570 --> 05:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
replaces the
 
05:48:21.110 --> 05:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph that was problematical in at
 
05:48:24.470 --> 05:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
the hearing that is to send the notice
 
05:48:27.590 --> 05:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
to the policy committee
 
05:48:27.600 --> 05:48:29.750 align:start position:0%
to the policy committee
and

05:48:29.750 --> 05:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:48:32.690 --> 05:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of other stuff that
 
05:48:32.700 --> 05:48:33.708 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of other stuff that
um

05:48:33.708 --> 05:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:37.548 --> 05:48:37.558 align:start position:0%
look difficult to implement and simply
 
05:48:40.970 --> 05:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
says that the rule making measure shall
 
05:48:42.530 --> 05:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
be sent to all members of the general
 
05:48:42.540 --> 05:48:44.270 align:start position:0%
be sent to all members of the general
court

05:48:44.270 --> 05:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
court
 
05:48:47.390 --> 05:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
so that ensures that everybody gets a
 
05:48:48.530 --> 05:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
copy of it
 
05:48:51.410 --> 05:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
if they are concerned about a rule
 
05:48:54.830 --> 05:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
they're notified when it is being
 
05:48:57.110 --> 05:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
when the initial draft is open for
 
05:49:00.110 --> 05:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
public comment and they can comment
 
05:49:02.330 --> 05:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
this will not cause any delays because
 
05:49:05.030 --> 05:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
it is the public comment period
 
05:49:07.970 --> 05:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
question of the chair yes sir isn't that
 
05:49:09.948 --> 05:49:09.958 align:start position:0%
the case that this sending will be by
 
05:49:12.110 --> 05:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
email yes sir yes
 
05:49:16.010 --> 05:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:18.110 --> 05:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
you didn't notice because you've already
 
05:49:21.350 --> 05:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
get the rulemaking register but it's
 
05:49:24.170 --> 05:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
been I believe two weeks since we tried
 
05:49:26.628 --> 05:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
it out and so everybody should be
 
05:49:31.010 --> 05:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:33.350 --> 05:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
um Monday night I gave a lesson to the
 
05:49:35.390 --> 05:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
HRA on how to read it
 
05:49:35.400 --> 05:49:40.150 align:start position:0%
HRA on how to read it
foreign

05:49:40.150 --> 05:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:43.128 --> 05:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
this and and I think it's appropriate
 
05:49:46.070 --> 05:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
for uh everyone who's out there in the
 
05:49:48.770 --> 05:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
universe was watching uh but especially
 
05:49:51.948 --> 05:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
our colleagues on Edna uh but for that
 
05:49:53.868 --> 05:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
matter all members of the house because
 
05:49:56.090 --> 05:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
uh having served on the joint
 
05:49:57.708 --> 05:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
 
05:50:00.948 --> 05:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
rules for the past 16 plus years along
 
05:50:02.448 --> 05:50:02.458 align:start position:0%
with representative McGuire for about
 
05:50:05.750 --> 05:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
the last 10 or 12 of those years
 
05:50:05.760 --> 05:50:06.590 align:start position:0%
the last 10 or 12 of those years
um

05:50:06.590 --> 05:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:09.470 --> 05:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
the reality is that we are very very
 
05:50:11.990 --> 05:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
seldom visited at a jail car meeting by
 
05:50:13.850 --> 05:50:13.860 align:start position:0%
a member of the general court
 
05:50:18.048 --> 05:50:18.058 align:start position:0%
either house or Senate and the rules are
 
05:50:20.330 --> 05:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
it's a poorly understood science but
 
05:50:23.208 --> 05:50:23.218 align:start position:0%
it's a very highly developed aspect and
 
05:50:25.250 --> 05:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
we've had several bills dealing with
 
05:50:29.628 --> 05:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
with rules uh here in Edna uh one of the
 
05:50:32.208 --> 05:50:32.218 align:start position:0%
reasons I was put on gel car and Edna at
 
05:50:35.270 --> 05:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
the same time 16 plus years ago but the
 
05:50:38.150 --> 05:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
reality is uh because it's so poorly
 
05:50:39.890 --> 05:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
understood there's a lot of
 
05:50:42.770 --> 05:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
misconceptions about you know agencies
 
05:50:45.830 --> 05:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
running amok or writing any rules they
 
05:50:49.490 --> 05:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
like and so forth and so on and we we
 
05:50:51.830 --> 05:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
may not all want to follow it as closely
 
05:50:54.230 --> 05:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
as those who who are chained the gel car
 
05:50:57.310 --> 05:50:57.320 align:start position:0%
wheel uh voluntarily or involuntarily
 
05:51:00.590 --> 05:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
but we we ought to know more about it in
 
05:51:02.750 --> 05:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
on this committee for sure but it ought
 
05:51:04.850 --> 05:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
to be available so people at least have
 
05:51:07.310 --> 05:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
an idea that is out there that they can
 
05:51:09.350 --> 05:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
look and they can see what what this
 
05:51:10.750 --> 05:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
process is like
 
05:51:13.190 --> 05:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
and and therefore they will understand
 
05:51:15.890 --> 05:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
it better they will be available maybe
 
05:51:17.510 --> 05:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
one over two of them will want to get up
 
05:51:19.788 --> 05:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
on an extra Friday and come in or
 
05:51:22.970 --> 05:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
Thursday during vacation week a vacation
 
05:51:26.690 --> 05:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
period and come and visit us and see
 
05:51:29.810 --> 05:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
that this is an Earnest uh effort on the
 
05:51:32.150 --> 05:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
part of the administrative rules unit
 
05:51:35.390 --> 05:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
the agencies the Departments and the
 
05:51:37.368 --> 05:51:37.378 align:start position:0%
members of the general court who serve
 
05:51:38.990 --> 05:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
on the jail car both in the Senate and
 
05:51:41.750 --> 05:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
the house so these are steps in that
 
05:51:43.850 --> 05:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
direction without complicating your life
 
05:51:45.708 --> 05:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
you don't have to look at it if you
 
05:51:46.788 --> 05:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
don't want to but you might learn
 
05:51:49.970 --> 05:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
something so I recommend it thank you
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to continue that the rulemaking
 
05:51:56.690 --> 05:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
register being sent to everyone deals
 
05:51:58.850 --> 05:51:58.860 align:start position:0%
with a lot of the issues of sending it
 
05:52:01.368 --> 05:52:01.378 align:start position:0%
to the policy committee because people
 
05:52:04.190 --> 05:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
may be concerned about a rule I mean the
 
05:52:06.470 --> 05:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee may have passed a bill but the
 
05:52:08.330 --> 05:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
sponsor wasn't necessarily on that
 
05:52:10.310 --> 05:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
committee and there may be other people
 
05:52:12.170 --> 05:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
who know something about it
 
05:52:15.190 --> 05:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
that could really help the
 
05:52:18.830 --> 05:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
develop the make sure the rule meets the
 
05:52:20.750 --> 05:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
legislative intent
 
05:52:24.650 --> 05:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
the other Chan the amendment also adds
 
05:52:26.288 --> 05:52:26.298 align:start position:0%
the requirement
 
05:52:30.170 --> 05:52:30.180 align:start position:0%
that when the agency files the final
 
05:52:30.180 --> 05:52:32.090 align:start position:0%
that when the agency files the final
rule

05:52:32.090 --> 05:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
rule
 
05:52:34.850 --> 05:52:34.860 align:start position:0%
they have to include a report on the
 
05:52:37.548 --> 05:52:37.558 align:start position:0%
public comments and an explanation of
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
how they were addressed
 
05:52:41.868 --> 05:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
they don't have to follow the comments
 
05:52:44.030 --> 05:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
they just have to acknowledge that they
 
05:52:46.190 --> 05:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
got them and what they did
 
05:52:49.430 --> 05:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
some departments do this now Des is
 
05:52:49.440 --> 05:52:50.690 align:start position:0%
some departments do this now Des is
exemplary

05:52:50.690 --> 05:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
exemplary
 
05:52:53.810 --> 05:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
other departments don't but it's always
 
05:52:57.590 --> 05:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
valuable to know who commented
 
05:53:00.110 --> 05:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
and what the comments and concerns were
 
05:53:03.288 --> 05:53:03.298 align:start position:0%
and how the agency addressed it I mean
 
05:53:06.110 --> 05:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
I've seen differences from oh they
 
05:53:08.750 --> 05:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
pointed this out and we said marvelous
 
05:53:10.548 --> 05:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
idea let's do it
 
05:53:13.670 --> 05:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
to well we think that we think we're
 
05:53:15.230 --> 05:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
right and they're wrong and we ignored
 
05:53:18.170 --> 05:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
it so anything in that range
 
05:53:21.410 --> 05:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
is reasonable but at least when the jail
 
05:53:24.048 --> 05:53:24.058 align:start position:0%
car is evaluating the rule they'll
 
05:53:25.310 --> 05:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
they'll know what what the public
 
05:53:28.128 --> 05:53:28.138 align:start position:0%
thought or at least those that cared
 
05:53:30.070 --> 05:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
enough to comment
 
05:53:33.948 --> 05:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
all right and and there's a a minor
 
05:53:37.670 --> 05:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
technical correction in the amendment to
 
05:53:37.680 --> 05:53:38.930 align:start position:0%
technical correction in the amendment to
um

05:53:38.930 --> 05:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:38.940 --> 05:53:41.208 align:start position:0%
um
change

05:53:41.208 --> 05:53:41.218 align:start position:0%
change
 
05:53:43.850 --> 05:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
one of the deadlines to agree with other
 
05:53:46.730 --> 05:53:46.740 align:start position:0%
parts of 541a
 
05:53:51.410 --> 05:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:51.420 --> 05:53:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
any

05:53:53.510 --> 05:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:53:55.670 --> 05:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion on the
 
05:54:01.368 --> 05:54:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:03.410 --> 05:54:03.420 align:start position:0%

05:58:32.510 --> 05:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
treatment plan with the audiologist or
 
05:58:34.910 --> 05:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
speech language pathologist of a client
 
05:58:36.770 --> 05:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
with communication or disorders during
 
05:58:39.410 --> 05:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
the provision of Music Therapy Services
 
05:58:41.690 --> 05:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
so this is the kind of this is that's
 
05:58:44.330 --> 05:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
what that's how this bill of men's house
 
05:58:48.650 --> 05:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:52.730 --> 05:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
second was it I was
 
05:58:54.770 --> 05:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
yes represent Gould you should speak to
 
05:58:56.330 --> 05:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
your second
 
05:58:56.340 --> 05:58:57.590 align:start position:0%
your second
yes

05:58:57.590 --> 05:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:59:00.410 --> 05:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
um I really support this amendment and
 
05:59:01.850 --> 05:59:01.860 align:start position:0%
Jackie thank you for doing such great
 
05:59:06.170 --> 05:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:06.180 --> 05:59:08.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:59:08.510 --> 05:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:59:10.850 --> 05:59:10.860 align:start position:0%
all right representative Schmidt and
 
05:59:12.350 --> 05:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you thank
 
05:59:14.330 --> 05:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
you ma'am sure I think uh um everyone
 
05:59:16.788 --> 05:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
should understand that uh one of the
 
05:59:19.070 --> 05:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
only impediments to the successful
 
05:59:22.430 --> 05:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
passage of the bill uh earlier in in the
 
05:59:26.868 --> 05:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh not this legislature but previous to
 
05:59:29.030 --> 05:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
05:59:32.750 --> 05:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
was that the speech pathologists and the
 
05:59:35.448 --> 05:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
music therapists were in a little bit of
 
05:59:38.090 --> 05:59:38.100 align:start position:0%
a turf war with regard to who does what
 
05:59:40.448 --> 05:59:40.458 align:start position:0%
and where the where the Venn diagram
 
05:59:44.448 --> 05:59:44.458 align:start position:0%
crossed over or whatever uh but but the
 
05:59:48.350 --> 05:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
two two uh former adversaries who always
 
05:59:50.510 --> 05:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
had lots in common in terms of working
 
05:59:54.530 --> 05:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of people with various
 
05:59:56.570 --> 05:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
different health issues
 
05:59:59.330 --> 05:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
um and and they have come together and
 
06:00:02.750 --> 06:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment is crucial toward the uh
 
06:00:06.430 --> 06:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
toward the the bill being whole and and
 
06:00:09.288 --> 06:00:09.298 align:start position:0%
containing all the aspects that it needs
 
06:00:12.048 --> 06:00:12.058 align:start position:0%
to so I think it's important that we
 
06:00:16.430 --> 06:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
have adopted the amendment uh and uh so
 
06:00:21.230 --> 06:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:24.530 --> 06:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
okay representative blackest thank you
 
06:00:26.750 --> 06:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
um although I plan on voting um against
 
06:00:28.970 --> 06:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
the otpa I'm actually going to vote to
 
06:00:31.430 --> 06:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
support this amendment um given the
 
06:00:32.868 --> 06:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
current circumstances there's a
 
06:00:35.090 --> 06:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
reasonable chance this bill's uh going
 
06:00:36.470 --> 06:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
to be adopted
 
06:00:38.150 --> 06:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
and if so
 
06:00:39.288 --> 06:00:39.298 align:start position:0%
um I think it should be with this
 
06:00:40.730 --> 06:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
amendment I want to thank represent
 
06:00:43.010 --> 06:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
grota for working in the subcommittee
 
06:00:45.288 --> 06:00:45.298 align:start position:0%
uh for and sorting this out between the
 
06:00:47.090 --> 06:00:47.100 align:start position:0%
two groups and
 
06:00:49.190 --> 06:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it in the overall
 
06:00:50.510 --> 06:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
scheme of things would make it
 
06:00:52.250 --> 06:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
significantly more likely the bill is
 
06:00:54.048 --> 06:00:54.058 align:start position:0%
going to pass but if it does pass I'd
 
06:00:55.788 --> 06:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
like to see it with the amendment
 
06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
06:00:58.320 --> 06:00:59.868 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
representative

06:00:59.868 --> 06:00:59.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:01:01.850 --> 06:01:01.860 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'll just say
 
06:01:05.288 --> 06:01:05.298 align:start position:0%
we've we've dealt with this subject for
 
06:01:07.430 --> 06:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
seems quite a few years in this
 
06:01:10.610 --> 06:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
committee and uh as representative
 
06:01:14.750 --> 06:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
Schmidt indicated the issues between the
 
06:01:16.670 --> 06:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
speech pathologists and the music
 
06:01:20.570 --> 06:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
therapists always arose and this looks
 
06:01:22.670 --> 06:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
like a pretty good compromise and
 
06:01:25.970 --> 06:01:25.980 align:start position:0%
cooperation between those two so I
 
06:01:28.250 --> 06:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
definitely will be supporting this
 
06:01:31.548 --> 06:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:34.610 --> 06:01:34.620 align:start position:0%

06:03:31.250 --> 06:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:36.708 --> 06:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:40.730 --> 06:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
okay and I'll I'll be a little briefer I
 
06:03:42.048 --> 06:03:42.058 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say I was really touched
 
06:03:43.788 --> 06:03:43.798 align:start position:0%
by the veteran who came in and testified
 
06:03:46.010 --> 06:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
at the committee and I think this is a
 
06:03:47.990 --> 06:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
really important service for a lot of
 
06:03:49.730 --> 06:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
people in our society but especially I
 
06:03:52.368 --> 06:03:52.378 align:start position:0%
have a heart for our veterans and that
 
06:03:54.230 --> 06:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
for people in business whether we
 
06:03:55.788 --> 06:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
support our current health care System
 
06:03:57.350 --> 06:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
the way it's organized the way Insurance
 
06:03:59.330 --> 06:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
set up there's other remedies if we
 
06:04:01.548 --> 06:04:01.558 align:start position:0%
disagree with that but to the extent
 
06:04:03.890 --> 06:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
that's what what we have that music
 
06:04:06.288 --> 06:04:06.298 align:start position:0%
therapists need to be able to get
 
06:04:08.270 --> 06:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursed so that people of all income
 
06:04:10.190 --> 06:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
levels especially our vets can have
 
06:04:16.030 --> 06:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:19.730 --> 06:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative Gerhard
 
06:04:21.530 --> 06:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
06:04:23.628 --> 06:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
I'm just a little concerned about so at
 
06:04:24.770 --> 06:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
the end of the day somebody's paying for
 
06:04:26.090 --> 06:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
the insurance
 
06:04:29.510 --> 06:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
and at 150 to 180 an hour that's what I
 
06:04:31.070 --> 06:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
have the notes from the initial hearings
 
06:04:34.310 --> 06:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
it just seems excessive but besides that
 
06:04:36.650 --> 06:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious as to if Insurance can
 
06:04:38.990 --> 06:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
cancel coverage for this service I don't
 
06:04:40.368 --> 06:04:40.378 align:start position:0%
know where that is legally but that's my
 
06:04:41.750 --> 06:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
concern and I'll just put that out there
 
06:04:44.628 --> 06:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
so uh private insurance can do whatever
 
06:04:47.990 --> 06:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
they want essentially within within the
 
06:04:49.910 --> 06:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
scope of what we've mandated they've
 
06:04:52.548 --> 06:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
covered but I this I believe would be
 
06:04:55.368 --> 06:04:55.378 align:start position:0%
optional representative blackis yeah we
 
06:04:57.470 --> 06:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
heard that in the subcommittee that I
 
06:05:00.110 --> 06:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
mean this doesn't require
 
06:05:02.150 --> 06:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
private insurance or anything else to
 
06:05:04.490 --> 06:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
cover it it just says if they cover it
 
06:05:06.530 --> 06:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
they they generally want
 
06:05:09.830 --> 06:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
licensing so that's why it's there okay
 
06:05:14.150 --> 06:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:16.850 --> 06:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
okay the motion is ought to pass with
 
06:05:20.270 --> 06:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment on House Bill 532 and the
 
06:05:22.788 --> 06:05:22.798 align:start position:0%

okay uh both
 
06:06:14.628 --> 06:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and itl have failed on a
 
06:06:16.490 --> 06:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
tie therefore it'll be going with no
 
06:06:19.368 --> 06:06:19.378 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh representative a bear
 
06:06:21.410 --> 06:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
will be writing the
 
06:06:23.930 --> 06:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
report in favor of itl and
 
06:06:26.150 --> 06:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative wrote it in favor of what
 
06:06:34.868 --> 06:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:34.878 --> 06:06:36.590 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:06:36.590 --> 06:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:06:40.628 --> 06:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:43.250 --> 06:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative leckis has a motion yes
 
06:06:46.548 --> 06:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move itl on this um
 
06:06:49.990 --> 06:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
this is another one of these um
 
06:06:53.448 --> 06:06:53.458 align:start position:0%
sorry I second okay it's another one of
 
06:06:56.810 --> 06:06:56.820 align:start position:0%
these open uh free software things and I
 
06:06:59.390 --> 06:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
I have certainly some sympathy there are
 
06:07:01.970 --> 06:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
reasons to be concerned about
 
06:07:04.070 --> 06:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
about having to run proprietary software
 
06:07:05.690 --> 06:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
especially if you have to run it on your
 
06:07:07.368 --> 06:07:07.378 align:start position:0%
own equipment and
 
06:07:09.350 --> 06:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing it at least I
 
06:07:11.810 --> 06:07:11.820 align:start position:0%
was confused initially it wasn't clear
 
06:07:14.150 --> 06:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
and I thought that the fiscal note might
 
06:07:16.970 --> 06:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
have been a little crazy however uh
 
06:07:18.830 --> 06:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
afterward furthermore further testimony
 
06:07:20.448 --> 06:07:20.458 align:start position:0%
I looked at the wording the language
 
06:07:23.208 --> 06:07:23.218 align:start position:0%
carefully it it did apply more broadly
 
06:07:25.730 --> 06:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
not only to the software run on people's
 
06:07:28.070 --> 06:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
equipment but also everything on the
 
06:07:30.048 --> 06:07:30.058 align:start position:0%
state side of it that people interacted
 
06:07:31.490 --> 06:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
with and
 
06:07:34.788 --> 06:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
you know that and whether the uh over
 
06:07:36.230 --> 06:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
three years almost a billion dollar
 
06:07:38.810 --> 06:07:38.820 align:start position:0%
fiscal node is excessive I don't know
 
06:07:41.510 --> 06:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be huge anyway even if
 
06:07:43.850 --> 06:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
it's not quite that and then on top of
 
06:07:46.190 --> 06:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
it this applies to political
 
06:07:48.890 --> 06:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
subdivisions including schools we never
 
06:07:50.570 --> 06:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
even saw a fiscal note on what the cost
 
06:07:53.090 --> 06:07:53.100 align:start position:0%
of that would be so I mean well there's
 
06:07:56.810 --> 06:07:56.820 align:start position:0%
some value to pushing towards the use of
 
06:07:59.510 --> 06:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
of open software it's not worth anywhere
 
06:08:03.230 --> 06:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
near the cost of this thing
 
06:08:03.240 --> 06:08:07.548 align:start position:0%
near the cost of this thing
okay

06:08:07.548 --> 06:08:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:09.890 --> 06:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
I think representative Lucas covered it
 
06:08:12.048 --> 06:08:12.058 align:start position:0%
very well okay
 
06:08:15.830 --> 06:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a comment question
 
06:08:17.990 --> 06:08:18.000 align:start position:0%

the motion passes 18 to 1. is there an
 
06:09:34.730 --> 06:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:38.690 --> 06:09:38.700 align:start position:0%

06:09:43.190 --> 06:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar
 
06:09:45.948 --> 06:09:45.958 align:start position:0%
and all right
 
06:09:52.730 --> 06:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:56.750 --> 06:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's the sponsor is always
 
06:10:01.070 --> 06:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:05.390 --> 06:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
okay so that was Bill 644
 
06:10:07.850 --> 06:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
06:10:10.128 --> 06:10:10.138 align:start position:0%
oh yes I'd like to make a motion of
 
06:10:16.730 --> 06:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:18.708 --> 06:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
representative Joel in seconds okay
 
06:10:21.110 --> 06:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:10:24.230 --> 06:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
just to speak to your motion I do
 
06:10:24.240 --> 06:10:25.310 align:start position:0%
just to speak to your motion I do
um

06:10:25.310 --> 06:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:28.850 --> 06:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
so what this does is it it takes certain
 
06:10:28.860 --> 06:10:30.048 align:start position:0%
so what this does is it it takes certain
um

06:10:30.048 --> 06:10:30.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:33.730 --> 06:10:33.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:37.070 --> 06:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
shampooing curling styling
 
06:10:37.080 --> 06:10:37.788 align:start position:0%
shampooing curling styling
um

06:10:37.788 --> 06:10:37.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:40.788 --> 06:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
not cutting nothing like not cutting on
 
06:10:44.628 --> 06:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
dying none of the harsh chemicals allow
 
06:10:46.610 --> 06:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
application of cosmetics
 
06:10:48.530 --> 06:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
and this thing called eyebrow threading
 
06:10:50.810 --> 06:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
where they use a cotton thread to remove
 
06:10:53.330 --> 06:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
hairs from the eyebrows in certain other
 
06:10:55.548 --> 06:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
places on the face so those would not
 
06:10:57.470 --> 06:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
require a license but all of the other
 
06:10:57.480 --> 06:10:59.208 align:start position:0%
require a license but all of the other
things

06:10:59.208 --> 06:10:59.218 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:11:01.190 --> 06:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
that are are you know potentially more
 
06:11:03.610 --> 06:11:03.620 align:start position:0%
risky will still require a license
 
06:11:06.288 --> 06:11:06.298 align:start position:0%
there's a second part to the bill
 
06:11:10.548 --> 06:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
that was added at the request of oplc
 
06:11:14.150 --> 06:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
and today if you have a salon you know
 
06:11:15.530 --> 06:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
the people working there assuming
 
06:11:18.708 --> 06:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
they're I mean today they have licenses
 
06:11:21.110 --> 06:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
individual licenses uh
 
06:11:23.230 --> 06:11:23.240 align:start position:0%
Barbara's con you know hairdressers
 
06:11:25.670 --> 06:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists estheticians and all that
 
06:11:28.070 --> 06:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
but then the salon owner also has a
 
06:11:30.708 --> 06:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
facility license a salon license
 
06:11:32.510 --> 06:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
but today let's say they have some extra
 
06:11:34.910 --> 06:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
chairs and they want to rent it to
 
06:11:34.920 --> 06:11:35.810 align:start position:0%
chairs and they want to rent it to
somebody

06:11:35.810 --> 06:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
06:11:38.868 --> 06:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
who at this point has an individual
 
06:11:38.878 --> 06:11:40.010 align:start position:0%
who at this point has an individual
license

06:11:40.010 --> 06:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
license
 
06:11:43.070 --> 06:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
to just practice in their Salon that
 
06:11:44.270 --> 06:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
person may not have their own Salon
 
06:11:46.368 --> 06:11:46.378 align:start position:0%
their own place to do it but they're
 
06:11:48.170 --> 06:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
they're doing it not as an employee but
 
06:11:49.490 --> 06:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
renting it
 
06:11:51.230 --> 06:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
currently the way the statue is written
 
06:11:52.548 --> 06:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
they have to go and get another whole
 
06:11:55.250 --> 06:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
Salon license just for that chair within
 
06:11:58.010 --> 06:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
what's already a licensed salon and
 
06:12:01.190 --> 06:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
under the um the statute around Salon
 
06:12:01.200 --> 06:12:02.448 align:start position:0%
under the um the statute around Salon
licensing

06:12:02.448 --> 06:12:02.458 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
06:12:04.128 --> 06:12:04.138 align:start position:0%
the salon owner the holder of that
 
06:12:06.110 --> 06:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
license is responsible for all the
 
06:12:07.868 --> 06:12:07.878 align:start position:0%
activities that take place in the salon
 
06:12:12.048 --> 06:12:12.058 align:start position:0%
and so oplc uh feels and I agree that
 
06:12:14.330 --> 06:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
that that's redundant there's no need
 
06:12:15.948 --> 06:12:15.958 align:start position:0%
for a separate license for this one
 
06:12:17.990 --> 06:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
chair that's already within a licensed
 
06:12:20.208 --> 06:12:20.218 align:start position:0%
Salon I think it's it's kind of a
 
06:12:22.490 --> 06:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
oversight in the law
 
06:12:25.670 --> 06:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
and that's that's it okay representative
 
06:12:27.590 --> 06:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
Dolan do us to speak to your second
 
06:12:27.600 --> 06:12:28.910 align:start position:0%
Dolan do us to speak to your second
okay

06:12:28.910 --> 06:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:12:31.610 --> 06:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
any uh discussion representative uh
 
06:12:34.490 --> 06:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
groda and then goalie I have a question
 
06:12:34.500 --> 06:12:35.810 align:start position:0%
groda and then goalie I have a question
so

06:12:35.810 --> 06:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:12:37.850 --> 06:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
but this doesn't prevents someone from
 
06:12:41.510 --> 06:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
opening up a business to just do blow
 
06:12:43.310 --> 06:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
drying so it's it's more than just
 
06:12:46.548 --> 06:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
involving the chair there's sort of two
 
06:12:48.590 --> 06:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
separate issues here
 
06:12:48.600 --> 06:12:49.490 align:start position:0%
separate issues here
um

06:12:49.490 --> 06:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:51.288 --> 06:12:51.298 align:start position:0%
because that was tacked onto this bill
 
06:12:54.590 --> 06:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
so the Brenda of the chair if they're
 
06:12:57.530 --> 06:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
doing things which are um
 
06:12:59.390 --> 06:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
assuming this bill passes if they're
 
06:13:01.070 --> 06:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
doing things that still require a
 
06:13:02.810 --> 06:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
license they're cutting hair they're
 
06:13:04.190 --> 06:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
doing dying they're doing any of those
 
06:13:05.990 --> 06:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
things they'll still need an individual
 
06:13:08.208 --> 06:13:08.218 align:start position:0%
license they just won't have to in
 
06:13:10.788 --> 06:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
addition get a salon license
 
06:13:13.788 --> 06:13:13.798 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes and the salon owner
 
06:13:16.430 --> 06:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
rents the chair to somebody who's
 
06:13:18.708 --> 06:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
limited to is limiting their practice to
 
06:13:20.448 --> 06:13:20.458 align:start position:0%
what we would allow without a license
 
06:13:22.368 --> 06:13:22.378 align:start position:0%
then they won't need an individual
 
06:13:24.350 --> 06:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
license but they're still being overseen
 
06:13:26.690 --> 06:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
by the salon owner because it says
 
06:13:28.250 --> 06:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for what happens in
 
06:13:31.208 --> 06:13:31.218 align:start position:0%
their Salon they could also
 
06:13:34.310 --> 06:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
set up business somewhere else that's
 
06:13:36.048 --> 06:13:36.058 align:start position:0%
not a licensed salon and do it on their
 
06:13:37.310 --> 06:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
own and that's true
 
06:13:39.890 --> 06:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
okay so I'd like to make a comment on
 
06:13:42.048 --> 06:13:42.058 align:start position:0%
that this this is where I have an
 
06:13:44.150 --> 06:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
objection to the bill if this was you
 
06:13:46.250 --> 06:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
know a license if this involves
 
06:13:47.930 --> 06:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
something within the salon and we had
 
06:13:50.090 --> 06:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
somebody supervising all that I would be
 
06:13:51.948 --> 06:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
okay with it but the fact that some
 
06:13:56.030 --> 06:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
individual can open up a facility and do
 
06:13:58.070 --> 06:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
this on their own is where I get
 
06:14:01.310 --> 06:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about creep because there is
 
06:14:03.650 --> 06:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
no way that
 
06:14:05.810 --> 06:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
um if someone has a client who has just
 
06:14:08.330 --> 06:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
washed their hair and dried it and that
 
06:14:11.390 --> 06:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
clients wants a trim or she wants their
 
06:14:14.330 --> 06:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
their bangs cut or something you know
 
06:14:17.270 --> 06:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
their hair layered there is no way that
 
06:14:20.390 --> 06:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
someone's gonna say oh I can't do that I
 
06:14:23.030 --> 06:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
just don't see that and it's no it just
 
06:14:25.730 --> 06:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
it's the client
 
06:14:29.150 --> 06:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
um relationship that I think makes it
 
06:14:32.448 --> 06:14:32.458 align:start position:0%
difficult for that person to say no and
 
06:14:33.948 --> 06:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
there and what we're saying is they
 
06:14:36.110 --> 06:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
can't do that but we're putting somebody
 
06:14:39.470 --> 06:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
in a position where they may do that and
 
06:14:42.890 --> 06:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
so that's my issue with this bill that's
 
06:14:45.470 --> 06:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
my only issue with the bill
 
06:14:45.480 --> 06:14:46.850 align:start position:0%
my only issue with the bill
oh

06:14:46.850 --> 06:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:14:49.250 --> 06:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure interesting
 
06:14:51.708 --> 06:14:51.718 align:start position:0%
first on blackest yeah I understand that
 
06:14:53.810 --> 06:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
concern I mean but there's
 
06:14:56.510 --> 06:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know a huge number of things that
 
06:14:58.070 --> 06:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
people may do
 
06:14:59.750 --> 06:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
um that they're not permitted to do I
 
06:15:01.730 --> 06:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
mean somebody may cut their neighbor's
 
06:15:03.770 --> 06:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
hair and get paid for it or something I
 
06:15:05.990 --> 06:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
mean we don't
 
06:15:06.000 --> 06:15:07.128 align:start position:0%
mean we don't
so

06:15:07.128 --> 06:15:07.138 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:15:09.170 --> 06:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
um and these activities that they are
 
06:15:10.788 --> 06:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
allowed which I understand you're okay
 
06:15:13.128 --> 06:15:13.138 align:start position:0%
with what people normally do at home I
 
06:15:15.110 --> 06:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
understand the concern but I think that
 
06:15:15.120 --> 06:15:16.010 align:start position:0%
understand the concern but I think that
that's

06:15:16.010 --> 06:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:15:19.070 --> 06:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
true in many many areas and restricting
 
06:15:20.390 --> 06:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
what people can do based on their
 
06:15:24.530 --> 06:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:27.410 --> 06:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative Goldie
 
06:15:29.628 --> 06:15:29.638 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I will be voting
 
06:15:31.310 --> 06:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
against the emotion
 
06:15:31.320 --> 06:15:32.270 align:start position:0%
against the emotion
um

06:15:32.270 --> 06:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:35.208 --> 06:15:35.218 align:start position:0%
I'm looking back at my notes and
 
06:15:37.190 --> 06:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
I think being part of the subcommittee
 
06:15:39.170 --> 06:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
the recommendation was to retain out of
 
06:15:41.990 --> 06:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee five to nothing
 
06:15:44.628 --> 06:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
um and I will be voting against
 
06:15:46.970 --> 06:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
the ought to pass and support uh
 
06:15:49.070 --> 06:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully this motion failing and the
 
06:15:50.750 --> 06:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
emotion of retain coming forward because
 
06:15:52.730 --> 06:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
I think this needs to be looked into a
 
06:15:55.270 --> 06:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
little further I mean we discussed the
 
06:15:58.190 --> 06:15:58.200 align:start position:0%
cosmetology part and the airbrushing and
 
06:16:00.288 --> 06:16:00.298 align:start position:0%
some of the other factors in this that I
 
06:16:02.208 --> 06:16:02.218 align:start position:0%
think can you know be a danger to the
 
06:16:03.410 --> 06:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
public when you get around the face and
 
06:16:05.868 --> 06:16:05.878 align:start position:0%
the eyes with airbrushing thank you okay
 
06:16:07.850 --> 06:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt and
 
06:16:11.750 --> 06:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
then gerhardt thank you ma'am chair so I
 
06:16:13.850 --> 06:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
I I understand the arguments
 
06:16:15.530 --> 06:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
representative leckis was making before
 
06:16:17.930 --> 06:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
and I think I would support that aspect
 
06:16:21.128 --> 06:16:21.138 align:start position:0%
of the letting the salon owner have a
 
06:16:23.390 --> 06:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
independent and licensed person working
 
06:16:25.910 --> 06:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
without a second license that to me is a
 
06:16:28.610 --> 06:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
no-brainer but but and I and I really
 
06:16:30.650 --> 06:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
don't have that much of a problem with
 
06:16:33.470 --> 06:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
somebody washing hair or styling here
 
06:16:35.628 --> 06:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
the the two issues that I do have
 
06:16:37.970 --> 06:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
problems with where I think hygiene and
 
06:16:41.868 --> 06:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
sanitation are not just oh well you know
 
06:16:43.788 --> 06:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
I don't see it that way and that is
 
06:16:47.270 --> 06:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
makeup for one thing when you're putting
 
06:16:49.128 --> 06:16:49.138 align:start position:0%
when you're putting your hands on
 
06:16:52.128 --> 06:16:52.138 align:start position:0%
somebody else's face uh and putting
 
06:16:53.810 --> 06:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
makeup on them and so forth and the
 
06:16:56.150 --> 06:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
possibilities I don't use makeup myself
 
06:16:58.128 --> 06:16:58.138 align:start position:0%
unlike some other high-ranking
 
06:16:58.138 --> 06:16:59.530 align:start position:0%
unlike some other high-ranking
politicians

06:16:59.530 --> 06:16:59.540 align:start position:0%
politicians
 
06:17:01.750 --> 06:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
but but
 
06:17:04.490 --> 06:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
the thing is when you're putting makeup
 
06:17:06.230 --> 06:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
on people there's a possibility of
 
06:17:10.070 --> 06:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
contamination as I understand it uh but
 
06:17:12.590 --> 06:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
also this threading stuff where you're
 
06:17:14.690 --> 06:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
putting something into somebody's
 
06:17:18.410 --> 06:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
eyebrows and do they Yank on them or
 
06:17:20.810 --> 06:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
something and pull out the eyebrows to
 
06:17:23.810 --> 06:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
me that even if it's done by people who
 
06:17:25.910 --> 06:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
learned it at home because it's part of
 
06:17:28.570 --> 06:17:28.580 align:start position:0%
their cultural heritage
 
06:17:30.708 --> 06:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
not all the people are going to be in
 
06:17:33.170 --> 06:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
that category and I don't I I'm not
 
06:17:35.150 --> 06:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable with letting people work on
 
06:17:37.970 --> 06:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
somebody else's face that don't have the
 
06:17:39.890 --> 06:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
necessary training and they ain't going
 
06:17:41.150 --> 06:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
to get it if they're only going to be
 
06:17:44.510 --> 06:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
doing hair washing shampooing and and
 
06:17:47.270 --> 06:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
styling and so forth so I can't support
 
06:17:51.110 --> 06:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
it in in the form it's being offered
 
06:17:54.708 --> 06:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gerhardt
 
06:17:56.510 --> 06:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
I've said this before
 
06:17:58.430 --> 06:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
let me go to something I'm gonna say no
 
06:18:00.048 --> 06:18:00.058 align:start position:0%
so last night for instance I was doing
 
06:18:02.628 --> 06:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
kickboxing and we're putting hands and
 
06:18:04.190 --> 06:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
feet on each other
 
06:18:06.470 --> 06:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
nobody died nobody gets infections
 
06:18:07.788 --> 06:18:07.798 align:start position:0%
because the guy he's an old school
 
06:18:09.650 --> 06:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
brawler who's to teach whatever coach
 
06:18:12.288 --> 06:18:12.298 align:start position:0%
instructor use Lysol wipes wipe your
 
06:18:13.788 --> 06:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
stuff down and I've never heard of any
 
06:18:15.830 --> 06:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
incidents of issues if there's maybe
 
06:18:17.390 --> 06:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
somebody gets ringworm you write you
 
06:18:19.128 --> 06:18:19.138 align:start position:0%
wrap duct tape around it you move along
 
06:18:21.288 --> 06:18:21.298 align:start position:0%
you keep it moving I just think that
 
06:18:24.048 --> 06:18:24.058 align:start position:0%
we're we're trying to get into this idea
 
06:18:25.730 --> 06:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
that everybody is three years old and
 
06:18:27.170 --> 06:18:27.180 align:start position:0%
has a room temperature IQ I think we
 
06:18:28.368 --> 06:18:28.378 align:start position:0%
need to start treating people respect
 
06:18:30.410 --> 06:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
and I mean I just I don't know I don't
 
06:18:31.610 --> 06:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
see the idea of having scissors near
 
06:18:33.230 --> 06:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
somebody's face as a reason to call the
 
06:18:34.670 --> 06:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
police and and start setting you know
 
06:18:36.470 --> 06:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
the reinforcements in I mean I'm a
 
06:18:38.150 --> 06:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
carpenter I can build a house now yes
 
06:18:39.410 --> 06:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
you have building inspectors that'll
 
06:18:41.150 --> 06:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
check your work but we could do the same
 
06:18:42.590 --> 06:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
thing we can make sure people leave in
 
06:18:44.090 --> 06:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
the The Barbershop don't have Cuts all
 
06:18:45.530 --> 06:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
over their face but I just can't
 
06:18:46.670 --> 06:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
understand how in New Hampshire you
 
06:18:48.110 --> 06:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
could build a house without having a
 
06:18:49.430 --> 06:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
license but you need a license to cut
 
06:18:51.170 --> 06:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
somebody's hair it just I'm just
 
06:18:53.868 --> 06:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
confused so that's where I'll stand on
 
06:18:56.448 --> 06:18:56.458 align:start position:0%
the contractors have powerful friends in
 
06:18:59.590 --> 06:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
the in the legislature
 
06:19:02.510 --> 06:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative Gould
 
06:19:04.368 --> 06:19:04.378 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
06:19:06.650 --> 06:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
I went to cosmetology school and I did
 
06:19:09.170 --> 06:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
send you all videos from YouTube on how
 
06:19:11.150 --> 06:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
did the threading happens and the hair
 
06:19:13.070 --> 06:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
washing so you'd know exactly how much
 
06:19:15.170 --> 06:19:15.180 align:start position:0%
training I really want to support this
 
06:19:18.170 --> 06:19:18.180 align:start position:0%
bill I'm going to vote no to the OTP but
 
06:19:20.570 --> 06:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
I really hope we can do a retain and do
 
06:19:22.310 --> 06:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
some work on it because I think with
 
06:19:23.868 --> 06:19:23.878 align:start position:0%
just a little tweak and we can get it
 
06:19:27.010 --> 06:19:27.020 align:start position:0%
over the finish line thank you okay
 
06:19:30.948 --> 06:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
representative Lagos so first um uh
 
06:19:32.090 --> 06:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
thank you representative goalie for
 
06:19:33.590 --> 06:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
reminding me I should have mentioned uh
 
06:19:35.270 --> 06:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
what happened in the subcommittee I just
 
06:19:37.128 --> 06:19:37.138 align:start position:0%
forgot and that is uh
 
06:19:39.948 --> 06:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
uh there was an attempt to OTP which
 
06:19:42.170 --> 06:19:42.180 align:start position:0%
failed and then we did a retain which
 
06:19:44.270 --> 06:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
was five to zero
 
06:19:47.030 --> 06:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
um but I later heard from a member of
 
06:19:48.770 --> 06:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee that changed their mind
 
06:19:50.930 --> 06:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
on it which the OTP I think would have
 
06:19:53.150 --> 06:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
passed in those circumstances so
 
06:19:55.310 --> 06:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's why I went and brought forward
 
06:19:57.770 --> 06:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
the OTP not not to try and get around
 
06:20:00.350 --> 06:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
the the subcommittee so
 
06:20:00.360 --> 06:20:01.490 align:start position:0%
the the subcommittee so
um

06:20:01.490 --> 06:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:01.500 --> 06:20:03.170 align:start position:0%
um
representative

06:20:03.170 --> 06:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:20:05.510 --> 06:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
06:20:09.788 --> 06:20:09.798 align:start position:0%
I'm inclined to support the OTP the
 
06:20:13.730 --> 06:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
challenge that I or the
 
06:20:17.590 --> 06:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
the challenge that I had in in this bill
 
06:20:21.048 --> 06:20:21.058 align:start position:0%
was one of the chemicals
 
06:20:23.030 --> 06:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
um or the fact that
 
06:20:26.150 --> 06:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
every licensed cosmetologist has to
 
06:20:26.160 --> 06:20:28.730 align:start position:0%
every licensed cosmetologist has to
carry

06:20:28.730 --> 06:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:32.990 --> 06:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
per OSHA MSDS sheets on all chemicals in
 
06:20:35.208 --> 06:20:35.218 align:start position:0%
their Salon I thought that was a
 
06:20:35.218 --> 06:20:37.930 align:start position:0%
their Salon I thought that was a
licensing

06:20:37.930 --> 06:20:37.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:40.670 --> 06:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
regulation when in fact it was an OSHA
 
06:20:42.530 --> 06:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
regulation so
 
06:20:45.110 --> 06:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
any shop that has any chemical shampoo
 
06:20:47.510 --> 06:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
whatever it is they have to per OSHA
 
06:20:51.110 --> 06:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
have the chemicals however I've not
 
06:20:55.868 --> 06:20:55.878 align:start position:0%
gotten confirmation of that so you know
 
06:21:00.048 --> 06:21:00.058 align:start position:0%
understanding the retain would be you
 
06:21:01.490 --> 06:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
know something that I would support as
 
06:21:03.350 --> 06:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
06:21:03.360 --> 06:21:05.510 align:start position:0%
well thank you
okay

06:21:05.510 --> 06:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:21:08.750 --> 06:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
so anyone else I can just ask a process
 
06:21:10.610 --> 06:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
question so
 
06:21:13.010 --> 06:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
if we were to
 
06:21:13.020 --> 06:21:14.448 align:start position:0%
if we were to
um

06:21:14.448 --> 06:21:14.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:16.670 --> 06:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
devote OTP and it weren't to go through
 
06:21:18.650 --> 06:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
could we decide to retain at that point
 
06:21:21.890 --> 06:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
if the OTP motion failed then then
 
06:21:24.010 --> 06:21:24.020 align:start position:0%
anyone can bring any other
 
06:21:27.650 --> 06:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
appropriate not sure thank you
 
06:21:30.350 --> 06:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else
 
06:21:32.510 --> 06:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
in that case the motion is ought to pass
 
06:21:34.430 --> 06:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
by representative leckis on House Bill
 
06:21:37.610 --> 06:21:37.620 align:start position:0%

the reasoning why in subcommittee that

06:25:00.110 --> 06:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
speak to your Marshall thank you so
 
06:25:04.010 --> 06:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill 655 was quite a hefty bill
 
06:25:06.288 --> 06:25:06.298 align:start position:0%
and when we found out that it was also
 
06:25:08.270 --> 06:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2
 
06:25:10.610 --> 06:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
we thought it would be a good idea to
 
06:25:14.990 --> 06:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
extricate the part of House Bill 655
 
06:25:17.690 --> 06:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
which we felt could be addressed quickly
 
06:25:20.628 --> 06:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
by this committee
 
06:25:24.830 --> 06:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
and that is the chapter that's 310 and
 
06:25:29.330 --> 06:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
Deals Only with oplc and codifies what
 
06:25:32.448 --> 06:25:32.458 align:start position:0%
the agency does which took up
 
06:25:32.458 --> 06:25:34.910 align:start position:0%
the agency does which took up
about

06:25:34.910 --> 06:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:25:37.368 --> 06:25:37.378 align:start position:0%
um 40 of the bill
 
06:25:40.310 --> 06:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
so House Bill and so they there are
 
06:25:42.048 --> 06:25:42.058 align:start position:0%
several there's a couple of components
 
06:25:44.628 --> 06:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
to this which is different than the bill
 
06:25:47.090 --> 06:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
that we originally saw if anybody
 
06:25:50.030 --> 06:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
actually read the whole thing
 
06:25:52.190 --> 06:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
um but there were some parts there were
 
06:25:53.930 --> 06:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
some concerns raised during the
 
06:25:56.990 --> 06:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee about
 
06:26:00.110 --> 06:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
um record retention and about
 
06:26:04.490 --> 06:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
um uh privacy and those
 
06:26:09.530 --> 06:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
um those um comments were added into the
 
06:26:12.530 --> 06:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
amendment by oplc
 
06:26:16.128 --> 06:26:16.138 align:start position:0%
and at this point we we I'm offering
 
06:26:19.910 --> 06:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment as a way to pass House
 
06:26:26.090 --> 06:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
Bill 655 in codifying what oplc does and
 
06:26:28.430 --> 06:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
this part of the bill will be removed
 
06:26:31.548 --> 06:26:31.558 align:start position:0%
from house bill 2. that's the plan
 
06:26:36.048 --> 06:26:36.058 align:start position:0%
okay so we are going to replace the
 
06:26:37.750 --> 06:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
Olive House bill
 
06:26:41.570 --> 06:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
655 with this amendment
 
06:26:43.850 --> 06:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
do you have anything to answer
 
06:26:47.150 --> 06:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
um yes I'd like to say this this was my
 
06:26:49.750 --> 06:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
bill it came out of the study committee
 
06:26:53.570 --> 06:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
on oplc that I was on this summer
 
06:26:56.990 --> 06:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
and what is it intended to do is to
 
06:27:00.170 --> 06:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
clarify what the responsibilities and
 
06:27:02.208 --> 06:27:02.218 align:start position:0%
duties of the office are
 
06:27:04.670 --> 06:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
and what the responsibilities and duties
 
06:27:09.048 --> 06:27:09.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:12.770 --> 06:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
as amended it gives the structure and
 
06:27:16.368 --> 06:27:16.378 align:start position:0%
setup of the oplc
 
06:27:18.470 --> 06:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
it is much better than the original
 
06:27:21.230 --> 06:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
version on
 
06:27:24.128 --> 06:27:24.138 align:start position:0%
the subject of
 
06:27:29.208 --> 06:27:29.218 align:start position:0%
investigations and discipline because it
 
06:27:31.850 --> 06:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
includes a lot of the work that we had
 
06:27:33.770 --> 06:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
in in specific
 
06:27:36.410 --> 06:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
licensing board statutes
 
06:27:40.010 --> 06:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
to differentiate between a formal
 
06:27:42.890 --> 06:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
complaint that has to be reported to
 
06:27:44.930 --> 06:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
your insurance to an allegation of
 
06:27:49.730 --> 06:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
misconduct it in ensures that the
 
06:27:49.740 --> 06:27:52.310 align:start position:0%
misconduct it in ensures that the
investigators

06:27:52.310 --> 06:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
investigators
 
06:27:55.610 --> 06:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
who are not necessarily board members
 
06:27:58.548 --> 06:27:58.558 align:start position:0%
but they are qualified
 
06:28:01.010 --> 06:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
experts that have sufficient knowledge
 
06:28:03.650 --> 06:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
on appropriate statutes or professions
 
06:28:06.470 --> 06:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
and their practices so that means if you
 
06:28:09.470 --> 06:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
have an electrical an issue of improper
 
06:28:11.030 --> 06:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
electrical work you'll have an
 
06:28:13.730 --> 06:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
electrical inspector looking at it if
 
06:28:15.110 --> 06:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
you have an allegation of medical
 
06:28:17.090 --> 06:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
malpractice you'll have a doctor looking
 
06:28:18.110 --> 06:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
at it
 
06:28:21.288 --> 06:28:21.298 align:start position:0%
and so that's something that was brought
 
06:28:23.810 --> 06:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
out as a concern at the hearing because
 
06:28:26.868 --> 06:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
the simplified language that was there
 
06:28:30.110 --> 06:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
before didn't specifically
 
06:28:32.448 --> 06:28:32.458 align:start position:0%
address that as clearly as many people
 
06:28:35.030 --> 06:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
would have wanted so I think the
 
06:28:38.750 --> 06:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
amendment is a significant Improvement
 
06:28:40.930 --> 06:28:40.940 align:start position:0%
and I hope you will adopt it
 
06:28:43.490 --> 06:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative leckis thank you I just
 
06:28:45.548 --> 06:28:45.558 align:start position:0%
have a question that so
 
06:28:49.730 --> 06:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
the investigator who's the has some
 
06:28:51.590 --> 06:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
expertise there the electrician the
 
06:28:51.600 --> 06:28:52.310 align:start position:0%
expertise there the electrician the
doctor

06:28:52.310 --> 06:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
06:28:54.350 --> 06:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
are they a member of the board are they
 
06:28:57.110 --> 06:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
an employee or contractor of oplc who
 
06:29:00.010 --> 06:29:00.020 align:start position:0%
would that be normally a contractor okay
 
06:29:03.190 --> 06:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
the board is going to be the jury
 
06:29:06.110 --> 06:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
essentially the judge and jury
 
06:29:08.448 --> 06:29:08.458 align:start position:0%
because and therefore they should not
 
06:29:10.250 --> 06:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily be the universe that was my
 
06:29:13.490 --> 06:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:16.250 --> 06:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
06:29:19.670 --> 06:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so uh I I have a
 
06:29:22.190 --> 06:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
couple of questions number one is uh
 
06:29:24.470 --> 06:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
this the the language of the amendment
 
06:29:25.910 --> 06:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
which I'm just seeing now for the first
 
06:29:25.920 --> 06:29:27.830 align:start position:0%
which I'm just seeing now for the first
time

06:29:27.830 --> 06:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:29:33.048 --> 06:29:33.058 align:start position:0%
is the product of uh of the oplc itself
 
06:29:36.470 --> 06:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
for the most part yes right and we I see
 
06:29:38.628 --> 06:29:38.638 align:start position:0%
we have one of the attorneys from oplc
 
06:29:41.510 --> 06:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
is here uh and so perhaps there will be
 
06:29:43.670 --> 06:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
some other questions but I certainly
 
06:29:44.990 --> 06:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
think this is a step in the right
 
06:29:51.110 --> 06:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
direction uh uh I know there has been a
 
06:29:53.628 --> 06:29:53.638 align:start position:0%
lot of pushback since we had the work
 
06:29:53.638 --> 06:29:55.368 align:start position:0%
lot of pushback since we had the work
session

06:29:55.368 --> 06:29:55.378 align:start position:0%
session
 
06:29:58.250 --> 06:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
um last Tuesday which just a couple of
 
06:29:59.830 --> 06:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
us were able to be here the chair
 
06:30:02.030 --> 06:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
represents the right somebody was there
 
06:30:04.548 --> 06:30:04.558 align:start position:0%
representative Wilhelm and I myself and
 
06:30:06.830 --> 06:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative Davis were there but the
 
06:30:09.288 --> 06:30:09.298 align:start position:0%
rest of us uh the rest of the committee
 
06:30:12.770 --> 06:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
were largely you know on vacation very
 
06:30:15.410 --> 06:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
often and something had been planned
 
06:30:18.048 --> 06:30:18.058 align:start position:0%
quite a bit in advance and couldn't be
 
06:30:20.690 --> 06:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
just uh you know thrown thrown away on
 
06:30:23.810 --> 06:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
short notice but I got a lot of pushback
 
06:30:27.230 --> 06:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
with regard to the 655 in terms of the
 
06:30:30.530 --> 06:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
idea of repealing licenses and or
 
06:30:33.590 --> 06:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
certifications yes I'm sorry that at the
 
06:30:35.350 --> 06:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
hearing I didn't make it clear enough
 
06:30:37.730 --> 06:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
that we weren't really talking about
 
06:30:40.128 --> 06:30:40.138 align:start position:0%
House Bill 655. we were talking about
 
06:30:43.190 --> 06:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 but we didn't have the
 
06:30:45.948 --> 06:30:45.958 align:start position:0%
exact language at that point we were
 
06:30:48.830 --> 06:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
working on the concepts that the
 
06:30:51.530 --> 06:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
governor and the oplc had put out saying
 
06:30:55.090 --> 06:30:55.100 align:start position:0%
this is going to be in house bill 2. so
 
06:30:58.070 --> 06:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
that was what we were talking about and
 
06:31:00.470 --> 06:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
it confused a lot of people to thinking
 
06:31:03.288 --> 06:31:03.298 align:start position:0%
they would be in 655 and that's probably
 
06:31:05.930 --> 06:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
my fault I'm not faulting you madam
 
06:31:08.448 --> 06:31:08.458 align:start position:0%
chair believe me I have no intent of
 
06:31:11.330 --> 06:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
doing that whatsoever uh but I certainly
 
06:31:12.770 --> 06:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
was one of the ones who was at least
 
06:31:16.128 --> 06:31:16.138 align:start position:0%
partially confused and
 
06:31:19.430 --> 06:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
um uh the the thing was that it was
 
06:31:22.070 --> 06:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
stated several times well it looks like
 
06:31:24.048 --> 06:31:24.058 align:start position:0%
it's going to be in the hospital too but
 
06:31:26.990 --> 06:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
Hospital 2 wasn't out yet so we didn't
 
06:31:29.930 --> 06:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
have it all we knew was a report an
 
06:31:33.110 --> 06:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
allegation a statement that it was going
 
06:31:35.090 --> 06:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
to be in House Bill too and of course
 
06:31:37.010 --> 06:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
the idea of repealing all this kind of
 
06:31:40.850 --> 06:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
stuff was anathema to me uh because I
 
06:31:42.650 --> 06:31:42.660 align:start position:0%
don't I don't believe in that and I
 
06:31:43.910 --> 06:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
certainly don't believe in putting it in
 
06:31:46.910 --> 06:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill too anyway I got a lot of
 
06:31:46.920 --> 06:31:47.890 align:start position:0%
House Bill too anyway I got a lot of
pushback

06:31:47.890 --> 06:31:47.900 align:start position:0%
pushback
 
06:31:50.208 --> 06:31:50.218 align:start position:0%
and I reached out to a lot of people
 
06:31:51.708 --> 06:31:51.718 align:start position:0%
because I wanted to find out whether
 
06:31:54.288 --> 06:31:54.298 align:start position:0%
they had heard of it and and most of
 
06:31:56.448 --> 06:31:56.458 align:start position:0%
them had but of course they hadn't seen
 
06:31:59.030 --> 06:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
the language of Hospital 2 either wasn't
 
06:32:01.070 --> 06:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
out so they couldn't
 
06:32:04.310 --> 06:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
um but but uh and so my understanding is
 
06:32:07.910 --> 06:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
that uh that the language the repeal
 
06:32:10.010 --> 06:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
section of hospital this first of all
 
06:32:11.750 --> 06:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
this will definitely come out of
 
06:32:13.670 --> 06:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
Hospital too if this amendment is
 
06:32:16.850 --> 06:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
adopted yeah well yes what
 
06:32:19.250 --> 06:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
that's why we're meeting on Friday
 
06:32:21.770 --> 06:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
afternoon I understand this ongoing
 
06:32:23.270 --> 06:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
process but we're dealing with this
 
06:32:25.430 --> 06:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
right now I have spoken
 
06:32:28.610 --> 06:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:31.850 --> 06:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
fine agreement in principle so
 
06:32:34.250 --> 06:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
we take everything that's in house in
 
06:32:37.970 --> 06:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
House Bill 655 out of house bill 2. so
 
06:32:39.590 --> 06:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
that we don't have to try and keep them
 
06:32:39.600 --> 06:32:41.208 align:start position:0%
that we don't have to try and keep them
synchronized

06:32:41.208 --> 06:32:41.218 align:start position:0%
synchronized
 
06:32:41.218 --> 06:32:42.530 align:start position:0%
synchronized
uh

06:32:42.530 --> 06:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:32:44.868 --> 06:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
because of that meeting
 
06:32:48.368 --> 06:32:48.378 align:start position:0%
I was convinced that the
 
06:32:50.510 --> 06:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
Landscape Architects and natural
 
06:32:50.520 --> 06:32:53.330 align:start position:0%
Landscape Architects and natural
scientists

06:32:53.330 --> 06:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
scientists
 
06:32:55.730 --> 06:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
excuse me needed to be licensed because
 
06:32:59.510 --> 06:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
there was no other way to deal with the
 
06:33:01.190 --> 06:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
fact that our
 
06:33:06.230 --> 06:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
the Des regulations and are the state
 
06:33:09.830 --> 06:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
and local regulations require a stamped
 
06:33:11.868 --> 06:33:11.878 align:start position:0%
plan or whatever
 
06:33:14.750 --> 06:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
and without any kind of a license
 
06:33:16.788 --> 06:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
there's no way to decide who gets a
 
06:33:16.798 --> 06:33:17.810 align:start position:0%
there's no way to decide who gets a
stamp

06:33:17.810 --> 06:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
stamp
 
06:33:22.010 --> 06:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm working on com on dealing with
 
06:33:23.868 --> 06:33:23.878 align:start position:0%
that and taking that out of house bill
 
06:33:27.590 --> 06:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
too because it the governor appears to
 
06:33:27.600 --> 06:33:28.548 align:start position:0%
too because it the governor appears to
have

06:33:28.548 --> 06:33:28.558 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:33:31.610 --> 06:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
jump to conclusions on those those
 
06:33:31.620 --> 06:33:35.510 align:start position:0%
jump to conclusions on those those
professions

06:33:35.510 --> 06:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:38.208 --> 06:33:38.218 align:start position:0%
the other deletions I am not touching
 
06:33:41.750 --> 06:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
because I can't I can't do everything if
 
06:33:43.970 --> 06:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:33:46.490 --> 06:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
I think that it's those were the
 
06:33:48.830 --> 06:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
governor's ideas he didn't consult with
 
06:33:52.250 --> 06:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
us he didn't and therefore it's his job
 
06:33:54.590 --> 06:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
to defend them
 
06:33:58.190 --> 06:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm very appreciative of uh of
 
06:34:01.070 --> 06:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
your statement because I think you're
 
06:34:02.650 --> 06:34:02.660 align:start position:0%
certainly heading in the right direction
 
06:34:06.110 --> 06:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh there's no way I would support uh the
 
06:34:10.490 --> 06:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
trailer bill with a repeal con section
 
06:34:12.890 --> 06:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
in there that would strip away the
 
06:34:14.690 --> 06:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
licenses even though the ones that were
 
06:34:17.150 --> 06:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
in the news release that we received
 
06:34:19.430 --> 06:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
from the office of Professional
 
06:34:22.190 --> 06:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
Licensing and certification uh director
 
06:34:23.810 --> 06:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
Courtney was
 
06:34:26.448 --> 06:34:26.458 align:start position:0%
here at one point and she's not here can
 
06:34:27.948 --> 06:34:27.958 align:start position:0%
I just make a comment we're supposed to
 
06:34:30.048 --> 06:34:30.058 align:start position:0%
be talking about the amendment yes I
 
06:34:31.548 --> 06:34:31.558 align:start position:0%
really would like to stick if it's okay
 
06:34:33.770 --> 06:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
with you I'm sorry I'm an M chair yes
 
06:34:36.110 --> 06:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
well I appreciate that and I I don't
 
06:34:37.730 --> 06:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
have any problem with that but since
 
06:34:39.288 --> 06:34:39.298 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of moving parts and I know
 
06:34:41.690 --> 06:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
we're coming back on Friday yeah believe
 
06:34:44.810 --> 06:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
it or not okay the day after tomorrow I
 
06:34:47.570 --> 06:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
believe it uh so anyway let's proceed
 
06:34:49.570 --> 06:34:49.580 align:start position:0%
and I will be here on Friday too
 
06:34:52.850 --> 06:34:52.860 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you we'll be glad to see
 
06:34:55.430 --> 06:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Gould
 
06:34:57.110 --> 06:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I just want to
 
06:34:59.270 --> 06:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for this amendment I also have
 
06:35:01.788 --> 06:35:01.798 align:start position:0%
gotten tons of feedback from my
 
06:35:04.610 --> 06:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
community though I didn't ask for it but
 
06:35:07.250 --> 06:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
um it's it's the only big volunteer yes
 
06:35:09.470 --> 06:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's the only Bill I've heard and I've
 
06:35:11.150 --> 06:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
heard a lot it matters to a lot of
 
06:35:14.208 --> 06:35:14.218 align:start position:0%
people and I did watch the um hearing
 
06:35:16.490 --> 06:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
live I watched you all that day you were
 
06:35:18.048 --> 06:35:18.058 align:start position:0%
doing the committee meeting I just
 
06:35:20.030 --> 06:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
didn't drive it so thank you all for the
 
06:35:21.650 --> 06:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
work on this I think this is really good
 
06:35:25.750 --> 06:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:28.070 --> 06:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
just uh another question on the
 
06:35:29.810 --> 06:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
investigation part so
 
06:35:32.510 --> 06:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
oplc will be hiring or Contracting with
 
06:35:34.368 --> 06:35:34.378 align:start position:0%
people with specialized expertise for
 
06:35:37.128 --> 06:35:37.138 align:start position:0%
investigations I know there's no new
 
06:35:39.830 --> 06:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but is there any guess as to
 
06:35:43.190 --> 06:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
the magnitude I'm just concerned that
 
06:35:45.048 --> 06:35:45.058 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many investigations
 
06:35:46.368 --> 06:35:46.378 align:start position:0%
there are how many would take people
 
06:35:48.890 --> 06:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
with expertise what it'll cost I just
 
06:35:50.628 --> 06:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned of a situation where
 
06:35:52.670 --> 06:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
licensing fees have to go up
 
06:35:54.590 --> 06:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
substantially because of this
 
06:35:56.690 --> 06:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
I might still support it but I'd like to
 
06:35:58.610 --> 06:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
06:36:01.670 --> 06:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that this is the plan that
 
06:36:04.070 --> 06:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
had been intended all along long that
 
06:36:06.410 --> 06:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
they that the expert would be contracted
 
06:36:09.530 --> 06:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
I believe that the medical board for
 
06:36:13.128 --> 06:36:13.138 align:start position:0%
example hires outside experts right now
 
06:36:17.628 --> 06:36:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:18.890 --> 06:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the total anyway
 
06:36:22.010 --> 06:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
anyway there there are
 
06:36:22.020 --> 06:36:23.930 align:start position:0%
anyway there there are
um

06:36:23.930 --> 06:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:26.810 --> 06:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
particularly in major K ish cases there
 
06:36:29.330 --> 06:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
are issues with
 
06:36:31.548 --> 06:36:31.558 align:start position:0%
people knowing each other it's such a
 
06:36:34.010 --> 06:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
small state that it you might if you
 
06:36:35.868 --> 06:36:35.878 align:start position:0%
have a serious case you might want to
 
06:36:38.448 --> 06:36:38.458 align:start position:0%
hire an outside expert that doesn't know
 
06:36:40.850 --> 06:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
sure I understand the concerns you start
 
06:36:42.830 --> 06:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
getting the antitrust and other problems
 
06:36:45.770 --> 06:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
and okay I just hopefully it's not going
 
06:36:49.190 --> 06:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
to dramatically increase licensing fees
 
06:36:52.430 --> 06:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
we have uh we have the attorney from the
 
06:36:54.048 --> 06:36:54.058 align:start position:0%
uh open you'll see here would you care
 
06:36:55.368 --> 06:36:55.378 align:start position:0%
to comment on that do you know about
 
06:36:58.910 --> 06:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
that issue Mr osterhaus
 
06:37:02.810 --> 06:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
since there's a specific question on it
 
06:37:04.850 --> 06:37:04.860 align:start position:0%
Douglas toaster how excuse me general
 
06:37:08.510 --> 06:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
counsel oplc uh we do have uh experts
 
06:37:11.150 --> 06:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
right now it depends we have a couple of
 
06:37:12.948 --> 06:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
experts in-house I believe like
 
06:37:14.708 --> 06:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
mechanical mechanical engineers
 
06:37:16.850 --> 06:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
pharmacists have their own experts other
 
06:37:18.708 --> 06:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
boards such as medicine Dentistry
 
06:37:21.110 --> 06:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
already have contractors and we always
 
06:37:23.510 --> 06:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
have a specialist to do the
 
06:37:25.490 --> 06:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
investigations already so we don't
 
06:37:27.530 --> 06:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
expect this to increase costs for
 
06:37:27.540 --> 06:37:28.730 align:start position:0%
expect this to increase costs for
licensees

06:37:28.730 --> 06:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
licensees
 
06:37:30.590 --> 06:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
okay great it's so nice to hear thank
 
06:37:30.600 --> 06:37:32.090 align:start position:0%
okay great it's so nice to hear thank
you

06:37:32.090 --> 06:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:37:34.430 --> 06:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
represent crota I do want to make one
 
06:37:38.330 --> 06:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:40.548 --> 06:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
um we might and we might not remember
 
06:37:44.510 --> 06:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
that we passed House Bill 445 which is
 
06:37:49.490 --> 06:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
the lapsing fun part of the oplc and I
 
06:37:53.030 --> 06:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
chose to leave that in the amendment
 
06:37:55.190 --> 06:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
So eventually we'll have to do something
 
06:37:58.010 --> 06:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
with this my
 
06:38:00.890 --> 06:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
um my intention and I've spoken about
 
06:38:05.570 --> 06:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
that with the chair of ways and means is
 
06:38:07.970 --> 06:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
to once we have
 
06:38:12.470 --> 06:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
voted on 445 to table it okay thank you
 
06:38:14.990 --> 06:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
because that'll establish the house
 
06:38:18.410 --> 06:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
position with without again
 
06:38:20.750 --> 06:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
creating the nightmare of tracking two
 
06:38:22.310 --> 06:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
different bills on the same subject
 
06:38:25.970 --> 06:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:28.910 --> 06:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:28.920 --> 06:38:30.708 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:38:30.708 --> 06:38:30.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:38:33.048 --> 06:38:33.058 align:start position:0%
in that case the motion is to adopt
 
06:38:37.310 --> 06:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
amendment 0807 to House Bill 655 and the
 
06:38:39.590 --> 06:38:39.600 align:start position:0%

06:39:34.490 --> 06:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
since the amendment replaced the bill
 
06:39:36.590 --> 06:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
we're both going to shut up at this
 
06:39:41.390 --> 06:39:41.400 align:start position:0%

28-09
 
06:40:33.288 --> 06:40:33.298 align:start position:0%
motion passes
 
06:40:37.070 --> 06:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
20-0 is there any objection to consent
 
06:40:39.530 --> 06:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
it's got an FN is that I don't know if
 
06:40:41.090 --> 06:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
what we know
 
06:40:41.100 --> 06:40:48.170 align:start position:0%
what we know
um

06:40:48.170 --> 06:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:50.208 --> 06:40:50.218 align:start position:0%
I think I will try and put it on consent
 
06:40:53.208 --> 06:40:53.218 align:start position:0%
and if the clerk or the speaker decides
 
06:40:54.890 --> 06:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
it's too expensive they'll pull it off
 
06:41:00.288 --> 06:41:00.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:02.990 --> 06:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your
 
06:41:05.750 --> 06:41:05.760 align:start position:0%

06:41:24.948 --> 06:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
we will be in on Friday to exec the two
 
06:41:28.250 --> 06:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:30.288 --> 06:41:30.298 align:start position:0%
and have us oh
 
06:41:32.570 --> 06:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
a work set a worked session and
 
06:41:34.190 --> 06:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
discussion on
 
06:41:36.650 --> 06:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
what I'm struggling to put to do with
 
06:41:38.270 --> 06:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
06:41:41.330 --> 06:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
the other point is that next Wednesday
 
06:41:46.310 --> 06:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
the 15th we have five bills
 
06:41:49.010 --> 06:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh to have public hearings
 
06:41:51.948 --> 06:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
and I intend to exec all of them during
 
06:41:54.230 --> 06:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
that day because
 
06:41:56.990 --> 06:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
first of all the deadline's the 16th and
 
06:41:58.970 --> 06:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
secondly that I've saved up some nice
 
06:42:00.948 --> 06:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
easy ones that we should be able to make
 
06:42:04.910 --> 06:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
up our minds on right after the hearing
 
06:42:08.690 --> 06:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
so uh we will be exacting
 
06:42:11.390 --> 06:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
those bills and if we do manage to do
 
06:42:13.610 --> 06:42:13.620 align:start position:0%
all of them we won't have to come back
 
06:42:16.610 --> 06:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
until we get some Senate bills so I hope
 
06:42:19.368 --> 06:42:19.378 align:start position:0%
hope everyone will cooperate with that
 
06:42:19.378 --> 06:42:20.510 align:start position:0%
hope everyone will cooperate with that
effort

06:42:20.510 --> 06:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
effort
 
06:42:22.430 --> 06:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
06:42:25.208 --> 06:42:25.218 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
06:42:28.548 --> 06:42:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:30.770 --> 06:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we're in session
 
06:42:32.690 --> 06:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
I believe it starts at 10 o'clock it's
 
06:42:32.700 --> 06:42:35.830 align:start position:0%
I believe it starts at 10 o'clock it's
normal

06:42:35.830 --> 06:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:40.190 --> 06:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
I no no no that would be wrong
 
06:42:42.470 --> 06:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
the majority leader would kill me if I
 
06:42:45.070 --> 06:42:45.080 align:start position:0%

06:42:47.810 --> 06:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
