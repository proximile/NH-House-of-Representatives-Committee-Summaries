there were two particular places in the
 
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
room that tried to break out into levity
 
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.710 align:start position:0%
room that tried to break out into levity
and

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%

all right the chair assumes that we've
 
00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
all had a chance to read the amendment
 
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
you will see different things that have
 
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
been changed and different things that
 
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
are added and the chair will entertain a
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
emotion on
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 218 as amended
 
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.129 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 218 as amended
um

00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
the chair will move ought to pass with
 
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
the amendment 218 that puts us now into
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
discussion and so the bill is 218 we
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
will be voting on the amendment in a few
 
00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:33.190 align:start position:0%
will be voting on the amendment in a few
minutes

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton the others are
 
00:14:41.769 --> 00:14:41.779 align:start position:0%
back so you can be funny if you wish
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have problems
 
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
with this bill uh that it says that the
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
personal transcript is admissible in
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
court because there's not a way to prove
 
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
its accuracy
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
um I think that it is demeaning to the
 
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
court uh transcriptors that we would
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
question what what they are transcribing
 
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
as you know what that's their
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
professional job
 
00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:13.970 align:start position:0%
professional job
um

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
anybody has the right to I think my
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
opinion is that anybody has the right to
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
make their own documentation but for it
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
to be admissible in court is a problem
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
besides being heavy equipment repair
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
person the uh committee researcher uh
 
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
reminded me that the motion I made needs
 
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
a second
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
and so I made the motion out of pass
 
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
with the amendment 218 do we have a
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
second to that
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
you may before it
 
00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
do we need a motion on the amendment
 
00:15:53.579 --> 00:15:55.069 align:start position:0%
do we need a motion on the amendment
first

00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
motion okay it's audience thank you and
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%

motion on the amendment to the bill
 
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.889 align:start position:0%
motion on the amendment to the bill
um

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%

00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
um so I went through this
 
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
um Amendment line by line and I just
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
want to extend my appreciation to
 
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi for listening to
 
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
our questions last time
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
um and coming back with some changes
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
based on that discussion I thought that
 
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
was really helpful
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
um having said that
 
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
um I still don't think we're there and I
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
have some further
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
um concerns about how this will affect
 
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
Family Court we still have not changed
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
anything regarding whether or not this
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
applies to every case that's heard in
 
00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
family court or if it's only specific
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
cases like divorces or
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
um child support or other things so as
 
00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
stands this includes Juvenile Justice
 
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
cases this includes dcyf cases this
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
includes any case that is being heard in
 
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:14.339 align:start position:0%
family court that anyone could now make
 
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
their own personal recording of
 
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
um under item three which is line 26 I
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
have a note to myself it says to protect
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
the Privacy rights of minors the quote
 
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
personal recording of abusive or adverse
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
treatment of any minor shall not be
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
distributed distributed or publicized in
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
any manner I thank representative
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
Bernardi for putting language in there
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
because that was one of my main concerns
 
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
was protecting the privacy of children
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
in the state however personal recording
 
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
of abusive or adverse treatment
 
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
that language is
 
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
um insufficient in that no one's being
 
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
abused or mistreated in the courtroom
 
00:17:57.529 --> 00:17:57.539 align:start position:0%
while one would hope without a bailiff
 
00:18:00.169 --> 00:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
or someone intervening my concern is the
 
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
testimony that is being offered in court
 
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
not the actual abuse itself being
 
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
publicized so I need something in there
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
that would say no testimony given by or
 
00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:15.539 align:start position:0%
in regards to mistreatment of minors
 
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
shall be publicized in any way I also
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
want something in there that says
 
00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419 align:start position:0%
something about we're not going to
 
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
publicize or share the identities or
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
personal information of any minors
 
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
involved in court cases I include dcyf
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
and Juvenile Justice in this these are
 
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
children who have run afoul of the
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
system and they don't deserve to have
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
their names out there on social media or
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
out on the newspaper or television it's
 
00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:45.539 align:start position:0%
simply unfair to them they have they
 
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
deserve the Opera opportunity to grow
 
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
even if they have made mistakes and are
 
00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
in the Juvenile Justice System that's
 
00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:54.419 align:start position:0%
why we seal records of minors the last
 
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
issue I have on this one is Article 4
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
which is also new and it says the
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
courtial supply all parties a digital
 
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
copy of the official court recording at
 
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
no cost in a timely manner I'm thrilled
 
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
with working on the cost because this
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
chart that we got last time that shows
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
how insanely expensive this is is highly
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
concerning having said that what does
 
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
that mean a digital copy does that mean
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
an MP3 a CD a WAV file how do we know
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
whether or not people are able to access
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
that I know as you all know I had brain
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
surgery this year all my brain scans are
 
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
Now on CD which I don't have the
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
technology to access because it's
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
obsolete I don't have a computer I could
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
put that in and see and so this is one
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
of my big issues that I took up with my
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
neurologist like you're gonna have to
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
print it out because I can't access this
 
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
so so as it is I will be voting against
 
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.150 align:start position:0%
so so as it is I will be voting against
OTP

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
OTP
 
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Raymond anyone
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
else oh yeah representative Bickford uh
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
um my concern is more in the first uh
 
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
section which says which talks about
 
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.470 align:start position:0%
section which says which talks about
um

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
shall not waive a family court a rule
 
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
and I I think they need that and should
 
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
have that ability to waive
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm on a planning board and on a
 
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
zoning board and we have the ability to
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
waive rules all the time and it's
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
important and very helpful to the uh I
 
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
want to say client or
 
00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
the parties
 
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
um in the case so I couldn't support it
 
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
for that more than anything and the
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
transcripts thing is
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
is I I agree
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
um not quite there I'm not against doing
 
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
additional transcripts it's just that
 
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
it could be cleaned up a little more but
 
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:42.539 align:start position:0%
definitely against the uh
 
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
not allowing the court to waive the
 
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
rules I'm surprised we even have the
 
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
authority to do that representative
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
Bickford I just discovered from my
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
primary care doctor I have water in my
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
left in my right ear which is why I have
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
been mishearing things
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
um they're supposed to drain me on
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
Thursday uh but as a result I did not
 
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740 align:start position:0%

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.390 align:start position:0%

lemon you may have that thank you
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
gonna be passing around you may have
 
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
seen this before or not this is on 108
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
this has to do with
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
penalties for making a false report
 
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
let's see five six seven remember we
 
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:07.940 align:start position:0%
discussed that and we didn't know
 
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
whether other states did this or not and
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
although just you know just because
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
another state does something doesn't
 
00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:21.299 align:start position:0%
make it right what we have here is a
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
50-state survey of what happens when
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
people make false reports
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
and I'll give us about five minutes to
 
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
look through this this should say
 
00:28:36.409 --> 00:28:36.419 align:start position:0%
something perhaps as we go to deliberate
 
00:28:36.419 --> 00:28:37.909 align:start position:0%
something perhaps as we go to deliberate
um

00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
you know the old little boy who cried
 
00:28:41.039 --> 00:28:42.110 align:start position:0%
you know the old little boy who cried
wolf

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
wolf
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
so many times that when a wolf finally
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
showed up nobody believed him false
 
00:28:46.919 --> 00:28:48.470 align:start position:0%
showed up nobody believed him false
reports

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
reports
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
um are bad so anyway
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
take a look
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
yes hi
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
um my stepmother happens to be a social
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
worker and she can verify that in uh in
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
the state of Pennsylvania that there are
 
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
plenty of people that make false reports
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
now I didn't ask her what the penalties
 
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
are there I mean that'll be in here
 
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
right but I can tell you from her
 
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
experience that that there are
 
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
definitely people that make false
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
reports so
 
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
okay take a look through this take uh
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
the chair will entertain a motion on
 
00:32:59.690 --> 00:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
I will
 
00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.630 align:start position:0%
I will
offer

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
offer
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford in expedient to
 
00:33:04.919 --> 00:33:10.190 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford in expedient to
legislate

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
and if I may
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
speak to my motion you may speak to your
 
00:33:18.769 --> 00:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
um I weighed this heavily and
 
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
I would like to see something of this
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
nature however I was here when Mary
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
Stewart Gile was the chairman of our
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
committee and brought follow these
 
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:34.140 align:start position:0%
uh child abuse legislation and it was
 
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
during a period of time when the Roman
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
Catholic Church was being exposed
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
permitted child abuse
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
actions and my fear
 
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
and her FEA
 
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
was that if we take this route
 
00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
then it will have a chilling effect upon
 
00:33:48.659 --> 00:33:49.730 align:start position:0%
then it will have a chilling effect upon
those

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
that could and should
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
make reports but would be in fear of
 
00:33:55.559 --> 00:33:57.130 align:start position:0%
make reports but would be in fear of
being

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:57.140 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:34:00.649 --> 00:34:00.659 align:start position:0%
seen as doing it maliciously
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
and what we wanted was the uh people to
 
00:34:06.529 --> 00:34:06.539 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
00:34:06.539 --> 00:34:07.450 align:start position:0%
be able to
um

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:07.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
be be free to uh speak up
 
00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I spoke with the
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor to this
 
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
um and I it happened this fall and I've
 
00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:29.899 align:start position:0%
had extensive uh conversations with him
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
and uh it was via email
 
00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:34.369 align:start position:0%
and uh it was via email
um

00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
he said that the intention of the bill
 
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
is to not discourage
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
Anonymous reporting
 
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
so so in other words you can still make
 
00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
an anonymous report
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
but they encourage you to give your
 
00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:54.419 align:start position:0%
information but you still don't have to
 
00:34:54.419 --> 00:34:56.570 align:start position:0%
information but you still don't have to
so

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:58.609 --> 00:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
um I think if someone is making a report
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
in good faith
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
they could still give their information
 
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
um there's always going to be an element
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
of people who might be intimidated to
 
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
make a report but if you suspect you
 
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
know a lot of people are mandatory
 
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
reporters I'm a mandatory reporter as
 
00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:20.339 align:start position:0%
well and all you need is a suspicion in
 
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
good faith
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
to make a report
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
and this bill the intention of it is
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
only to prosecute people making
 
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
malicious reports in bad faith and so
 
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
the impetus is to prove that there's bad
 
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
faith but you're also innocent until
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
proven guilty so I don't suspect that
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to cause there to be
 
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.349 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to cause there to be
um

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:53.579 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know the word I'm looking for
 
00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
but but
 
00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of people to
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
be found
 
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
that they were making a report in bad
 
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:01.910 align:start position:0%
that they were making a report in bad
faith

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
faith
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
but I do think that the people that
 
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
because there are bad people out there
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
that will make a report in bad faith I
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
do think there should be consequences
 
00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
I will wait uh let's go around one first
 
00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
chair would like to point out that's on
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
the first page of the bill
 
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
um one of the changes he's made is
 
00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
reports made to the department may not
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
must may include the name address or
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
phone number of the person or persons
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
making the report
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
there is a whole paragraph on anyone
 
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
participating in good faith I am a
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporter as well and I once
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
made a report and I wasn't sure I said I
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
think this is what's going on don't send
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
the Army check it out I may be wrong
 
00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
they later got back to me and said
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
here's what really happened I said thank
 
00:37:09.839 --> 00:37:10.550 align:start position:0%
here's what really happened I said thank
you

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
I made that in good faith I was not
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
punished for that we're talking about
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
the ones who are weaponizing this who
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
will call up and say that single mom is
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
doing such and such
 
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
and call again and call again and it is
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
not true it is weaponized these are the
 
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
people I think this bill is trying to
 
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.569 align:start position:0%
people I think this bill is trying to
address

00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
for the record this bill passed the
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
house last year it sat in the Senate
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
remember covid
 
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
a lot of things sat in a lot of places
 
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
and never got finished so this bill
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
passed last year we're bringing it back
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
any further comments yes representative
 
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.770 align:start position:0%
any further comments yes representative
Raymond

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
Raymond
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman so um as many
 
00:37:56.569 --> 00:37:56.579 align:start position:0%
of you know I worked for dcyf here for
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
many years
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
um prior to that I worked in New York
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
state for child protective services
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
there which is the same thing and in
 
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
both States I provided training to
 
00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
mandated reporters on when and how to
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
call the hotline to report abuse or
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
neglect and in general the advice that
 
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
we give people or gave people regarding
 
00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:21.140 align:start position:0%
when to call was if you're worried call
 
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
and let dcyf or CPS figure it out don't
 
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
you try and figure it out on your own if
 
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
you're worried just call and they'll
 
00:38:32.569 --> 00:38:32.579 align:start position:0%
screen it out at Central at the main
 
00:38:34.849 --> 00:38:34.859 align:start position:0%
office at the hotline office or they'll
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
screen it out when the worker goes out
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
there the workers are trained to try and
 
00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
make it as least traumatizing to
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
families as possible having said that
 
00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:47.900 align:start position:0%
they have also worked on many many cases
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
where there is domestic violence within
 
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
a family system and it is very common
 
00:38:59.210 --> 00:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
for someone to try to utilize dcif to
 
00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
harass their ex-partner or their current
 
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
partner or their you know their child's
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
partner because they believe one side of
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
it it's unfortunate it's awful I've
 
00:39:14.329 --> 00:39:14.339 align:start position:0%
worked in a state where they had this
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
law and I've seen the law applied twice
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
in the five years that I worked there
 
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
that was it twice where someone was
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
actually reported for false reporting
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
and I've only seen the charges stick one
 
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.349 align:start position:0%
and I've only seen the charges stick one
time

00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:39:27.359 --> 00:39:28.930 align:start position:0%
time
um

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:28.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest this one really
 
00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:32.870 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest this one really
um

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for me to decide because
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
I want people to call dcyf we don't want
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
to have more kids who are missing or
 
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
hurt and no one's doing anything people
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
need to call having said that I also
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
feel for domestic violence victims who
 
00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
have dcyf out in their home like three
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
times a month because somebody keeps
 
00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
calling on them
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
um so you know I can see where this
 
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
having consequences or even just being
 
00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.099 align:start position:0%
able to say to someone there's
 
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
consequences if you continue this
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
behavior of calling them in falsely dcyf
 
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
still has to investigate everything
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
whether someone Lies when they call in
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
or using it manipulatively the workers
 
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
still have to go out with a clean fresh
 
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
brain and try and be objective about the
 
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:23.930 align:start position:0%
brain and try and be objective about the
situation

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:24.710 align:start position:0%
situation
um

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
so I worry about the effect but I also
 
00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:32.300 align:start position:0%
see that 49 other states and DC and five
 
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
territories have this a similar version
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
of this bill so New Hampshire is a
 
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.490 align:start position:0%
of this bill so New Hampshire is a
standout

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
every person
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
every adult in the state of New
 
00:40:59.650 --> 00:40:59.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a mandated reporter
 
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
considering that we must remember that
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
all of those mandated reporters in this
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
state have not received training
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
so the statement of if you see it
 
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
it concerns you call
 
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
those are not the calls that this bill
 
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
is concerning
 
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
if an adult in this state sees that and
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
I think it was used in testimony a child
 
00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:32.150 align:start position:0%
I think it was used in testimony a child
goes

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
to the bus stop on a rainy day without a
 
00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.109 align:start position:0%
to the bus stop on a rainy day without a
coat

00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
coat
 
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
and then the next day it's still raining
 
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
and that child still has a coat doesn't
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
have a coat and then
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
something else happens and something
 
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
else happens that may be considered to
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
some as child abuse and they're going to
 
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
call and they should call
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
however it's the concern for the child
 
00:41:56.569 --> 00:41:56.579 align:start position:0%
it's not malicious
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
on the other hand as was just stated
 
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
you have somebody who's angry at another
 
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.530 align:start position:0%
you have somebody who's angry at another
person

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
and they call and again and again and
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
again and that is malicious that's why
 
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
we trained The Operators who are
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
receiving those calls
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
to try to differentiate
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
the difference and that's when they will
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
send a caseworker out they don't send
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
caseworkers out for every single case
 
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
so to protect the people who are doing
 
00:42:32.089 --> 00:42:32.099 align:start position:0%
no wrong
 
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
I think this bill makes sense and this
 
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
state should have a bill like this in
 
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
representative panic
 
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
I'd like to share personal experience my
 
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
son was involved in a child custody case
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
about five years ago and during the time
 
00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:00.980 align:start position:0%
frame that the case was going to be
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
determined where the child would be
 
00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
living the mother had moved out of state
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
the judge had ruled that my son should
 
00:43:14.569 --> 00:43:14.579 align:start position:0%
have custody of his son
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
that put the mother in a tailspin
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
and what she did is call the police
 
00:43:25.849 --> 00:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
and put a report in that my son made a
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
threat to her life
 
00:43:29.569 --> 00:43:29.579 align:start position:0%
which he did not
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
the police broke down
 
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
my son's house
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
the door and took
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
my grandson away
 
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
that traumatized the child
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
it took two years of therapy to get him
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
back on track
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
and it took a lot of forgiveness in my
 
00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.349 align:start position:0%
and it took a lot of forgiveness in my
heart

00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
heart
 
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
to forgive the mother for what she's
 
00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:56.180 align:start position:0%
done but people do do
 
00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
desperate things
 
00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
when you're in a child custody battle
 
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
and this would protect
 
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
fathers who are in the same situation
 
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
that my son was in
 
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
all right and I think this is really an
 
00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
any further comments we'll go to round
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
two representative Bickford thank you Mr
 
00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.270 align:start position:0%
two representative Bickford thank you Mr
chairman

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
um I don't disagree with any of these
 
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:28.140 align:start position:0%
things but I what we can't measure is
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
difficult to measure is the fact it's
 
00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
going to have a chilling effect I know
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
if this passes
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to think long and hard before
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
I take a chance on the system coming by
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
and arresting me for making a malicious
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
acting maliciously particularly if it
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
was well I wouldn't have a custody case
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
but anybody that does could be deemed as
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
being malicious and I think the division
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
uh dcyf has got a big task on their
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
hands but I think they're the right
 
00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
people to decide
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
to do the balance
 
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.030 align:start position:0%
to do the balance
and

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
I I just if you ever had to defend
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
yourself in court it's expensive and
 
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
it's scary
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
and and that's what could happen to
 
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
somebody that does make a call
 
00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:15.020 align:start position:0%
on their neighbor or whatever
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.530 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
yeah

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.030 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
for me I will not support this bill to
 
00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
be honest with someone who is a survivor
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
of domestic violin
 
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
uh this bill concerns me a lot
 
00:45:35.809 --> 00:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
pushing you to the Limit as someone
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
who's telling you
 
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
if you do a report if you call
 
00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
you're gonna get sent back to your
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
country where you came from and you're
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to see your kids
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
this is it scares me
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
um for victims like myself
 
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh yeah and especially like I say you
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
know if
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
immigration is involved
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
immigration cases
 
00:46:09.839 --> 00:46:10.849 align:start position:0%
immigration cases
um

00:46:10.849 --> 00:46:10.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
people can you know um
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
take it the wrong way so I for that
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
reason I will not support one away
 
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative ball
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to comment that I'm
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
concerned that I'm hearing more concern
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
about the person making the report than
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
the child
 
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
whose family is going to get involved in
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
an unfounded claim that puts a
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
tremendous stress on the family and the
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
child through all the interviews and
 
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:50.220 align:start position:0%
everything that they have to go through
 
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm afraid we're putting more
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
emphasis on the person worrying about
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
they may not report malicious means
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
you'd have to be doing it it to me seems
 
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
like it would be so obvious like you're
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
doing it repeatedly or it's so unfounded
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
or you can see that there's an intent
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
behind it
 
00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
if it's a good will and you just say
 
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
look I'm just watching out for the child
 
00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
that's seen there I I think it's easily
 
00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
just it's easy to see the difference
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
between one and the other my concern is
 
00:47:23.089 --> 00:47:23.099 align:start position:0%
more for the child and the family being
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
put through this traumatic experience
 
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again
 
00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily I will support this bill
 
00:47:34.849 --> 00:47:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll call the question the
 
00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
motion is inexpedient to legislate on
 
00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 108
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
an act relative to confidentiality of
 
00:47:46.609 --> 00:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
reports made to the division of children
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
youth and families as has been noted
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the bill that relates
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the title of the bill so
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's what we've got it's in expedient
 
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
to legislate if you want to kill the
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
bill you vote Yes
 
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
if you want a second motion to approve
 
00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
the bill you vote no
 
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:12.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
you got it right I mean this is no means
 
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
yes and yes means no
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%

committee
 
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
um usually consent is unanimous or only
 
00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:23.750 align:start position:0%
um usually consent is unanimous or only
one

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
against everybody else
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
if it has a financial note it cannot be
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
on consent it has to go off to finance
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
anyway I cannot be on consent if there's
 
00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
more than
 
00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:38.099 align:start position:0%
two votes against everybody else it
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
all right uh I'm slowly figuring it all
 
00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.950 align:start position:0%
all right uh I'm slowly figuring it all
out

00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.930 align:start position:0%
 
aspective

00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
aspective
 
00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
I'm going to pass around now some
 
00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
summary statements on the next bill
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to exec 126 3 4 5 6.
 
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
and you will see I even have a few notes
 
00:54:14.329 --> 00:54:14.339 align:start position:0%
on it
 
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
um which I didn't erase before I handed
 
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
it to the photocopying department and
 
00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:23.300 align:start position:0%
that's okay representative Spillane
 
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
obviously likes the bill because he put
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
it in but he says he doesn't mind if we
 
00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
retain or dispose of it this is the bill
 
00:54:35.089 --> 00:54:35.099 align:start position:0%
that wants to have the option of
 
00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
payments being on the first or the 15th
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
you will see in the handout that you are
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
getting there's not much out there for
 
00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
what other states have done on this
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see that on the last page and
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
even the two states that have done a
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
little bit about it they haven't done
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
much either so anyway
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:36.000 --> 00:57:20.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
the chair will entertain a motion on
 
00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
House Bill 126 an act relative to
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
choosing the accrual date for child
 
00:57:35.089 --> 00:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
I have never been in a shire committee
 
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
than this one wow I'm not complaining
 
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
can we just discuss it then uh
 
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
beforehand we really technically need
 
00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.589 align:start position:0%
beforehand we really technically need
emotion

00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
emotion
 
00:57:53.809 --> 00:57:53.819 align:start position:0%
but I never usually observe that do I
 
00:57:53.819 --> 00:57:56.030 align:start position:0%
but I never usually observe that do I
mostly

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
do you want a motion at least for the
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
sake of discussion yes
 
00:58:03.049 --> 00:58:03.059 align:start position:0%
yes then I I'll make a motion
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
um let's start with the positive one
 
00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
let's start with uh the OTP motion uh
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
for the sake of discussion
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Raymond is
 
00:58:14.329 --> 00:58:14.339 align:start position:0%
there a second I'll second that
 
00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton let's discuss
 
00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman representative Moulton thank
 
00:58:23.089 --> 00:58:23.099 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of people in this
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
country who are living paycheck to
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
paycheck and I think that by putting
 
00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
this is a harmless bill in my in my view
 
00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
because Bill sorry a hard harmless
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
harmless thank you yep harmless bill in
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
my opinion because we're just choosing
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
if they're paying it the first or the
 
00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
15th of the month so they're still being
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
paid so but by by putting the ball in
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
their Court they can families can budget
 
00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.690 align:start position:0%
their Court they can families can budget
better

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of stuff that comes due
 
00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:56.220 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the month like
 
00:58:59.569 --> 00:58:59.579 align:start position:0%
mortgages rents things like that
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
um so by putting you know another bill
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
later in the month for some people that
 
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
might work for them
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
um because if people are living paycheck
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
to paycheck they might need to do that
 
00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:11.220 align:start position:0%
so I just I I just don't see any
 
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
negative effects of this bill so
 
00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
representative representative Nelson
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:59:23.329 --> 00:59:23.339 align:start position:0%
um I am
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative Moulton's
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
viewpoint on this I'm actually thinking
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
about the person who is receiving the
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
money and they also have bills due at
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
certain times of the month my husband
 
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.069 align:start position:0%
certain times of the month my husband
paid

00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
paid
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
um child support for many many years and
 
00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:44.579 align:start position:0%
he always budgeted and figured out how
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
to pay on time no matter when he was
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
paid by his company so I I am not in
 
00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:53.460 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Greg
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um I do I mean you can
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
obviously see both sides of this I worry
 
01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:03.059 align:start position:0%
about us saying like Okay you're gonna
 
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:05.220 align:start position:0%
pick one of two dates every case is
 
01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
different whether somebody is getting
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
paid weekly whether somebody's you know
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
getting even paid daily or whatever I
 
01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
think this is best a discretion left to
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
um he you know the gentleman when he
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
spoke on the bill said well if you don't
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
want it the first you can go back to the
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
15th well you can actually do that right
 
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
now with 30 to 31 days sometimes only
 
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
28. I'll go back to the court I just
 
01:00:30.049 --> 01:00:30.059 align:start position:0%
don't see that us saying okay you need
 
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
to pick one of two dates is going to
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
help anything and for the same reason
 
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
too we have not only the payer we need
 
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:37.140 align:start position:0%
to think about we need to think about
 
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
the payee and that is best left to the
 
01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
courts to look at the entire situation
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
to decide
 
01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.010 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
I too think that uh this could
 
01:00:59.089 --> 01:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
potentially create some conflict in an
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
already conflict area between the payee
 
01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:05.339 align:start position:0%
and the payer in terms of going back to
 
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
court and filing motions
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
to change the dates that have already
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
potentially been set by the court so I
 
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
am not in support of this
 
01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:22.510 align:start position:0%
am not in support of this
foreign

01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
yet not testified round one
 
01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:30.059 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone thank you Mr
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh after lengthy discussions
 
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
with the prime sponsor although I am a
 
01:01:38.329 --> 01:01:38.339 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh it came to our attention that
 
01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.370 align:start position:0%
uh it came to our attention that
although

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
although
 
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
the thought is a great thought and would
 
01:01:49.329 --> 01:01:49.339 align:start position:0%
help some people
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
consistency is more important
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
so I will agree with those who will vote
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
moving right along to round two
 
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
 
01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:10.970 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
chairman

01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.559 align:start position:0%
um this is more of a question
 
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm misunderstanding the bill but
 
01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
I didn't think it gave
 
01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
you the ability to just pay it
 
01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly like I just thought that it
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
gave you the ability to just choose a
 
01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
date but you still would have to stick
 
01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
with it so there would still be
 
01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
consistency that that's the
 
01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:33.799 align:start position:0%
interpretation that I had
 
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone is a sometime
 
01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:40.910 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone is a sometime
co-sponsor

01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
not consistency in the payments
 
01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.349 align:start position:0%
not consistency in the payments
um

01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
we would hope that most of the people
 
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
who are paying child support would be
 
01:02:55.849 --> 01:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
consistent that's not always the case
 
01:02:59.210 --> 01:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
but my issue was consistency in the
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
court and when a couple goes before the
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
judge they have usually filled out all
 
01:03:07.329 --> 01:03:07.339 align:start position:0%
the paperwork and come to an agreement
 
01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
and to keep going back and forth to
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
court and saying well my employer
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
changed it from I don't get paid on the
 
01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
15th anymore I now get paid on the first
 
01:03:20.569 --> 01:03:20.579 align:start position:0%
and I don't get paid on the first
 
01:03:23.089 --> 01:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
anymore I now get paid on the 18th
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm talking consistency
 
01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
may I
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
I just yes you may thank you Mr chairman
 
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.289 align:start position:0%
I just yes you may thank you Mr chairman
I

01:03:48.289 --> 01:03:48.299 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
I I totally agree with representative
 
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
Moulton I I want to give her a little
 
01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
support here
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
but I happen to agree exactly what she
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
said I don't it looks pretty innocent to
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
me I I know maybe once in a while so I'm
 
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
going to go back and forth but
 
01:04:06.049 --> 01:04:06.059 align:start position:0%
um let them pick let her have some
 
01:04:06.059 --> 01:04:07.730 align:start position:0%
um let them pick let her have some
choice

01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
choice
 
01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I agree with
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone that um if this
 
01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass you had the option of
 
01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
one or fifteen so I'm going to go if if
 
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm looking to
 
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
drag my ex
 
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
Buster chops any way I can I'm gonna say
 
01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm gonna pick the first and then a
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
month later or two months later I'm
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
going to say
 
01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
yeah you know what I'm gonna pick the
 
01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
15th would be better so that's given an
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to increase the conflict in
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
my opinion because you have a choice
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
between the first of the 15th so let a
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
judge tell me that I you only get two
 
01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
choices no it doesn't say it here
 
01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
no I have a choice between the first and
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
the 15th and every other month I'd like
 
01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
to change from the first to the 15th and
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
what's prohibited me from stopping that
 
01:04:59.930 --> 01:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
in statute it says you could choose from
 
01:05:02.809 --> 01:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
the first to the 15th so I could see an
 
01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
increase in conflict
 
01:05:08.829 --> 01:05:08.839 align:start position:0%
taking a crash course in the law as I am
 
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
I would want the phrase to read on
 
01:05:17.329 --> 01:05:17.339 align:start position:0%
either the first or the 15th day of the
 
01:05:17.339 --> 01:05:18.490 align:start position:0%
either the first or the 15th day of the
month

01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:18.500 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:05:21.289 --> 01:05:21.299 align:start position:0%
consistently month to month I would
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
agree with representative long that as
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
written on either the first or the 15th
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
I could change that and bounce back and
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
forth and I could weaponize that
 
01:05:33.049 --> 01:05:33.059 align:start position:0%
so I would agree with you that it's not
 
01:05:35.809 --> 01:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
enough words here
 
01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
um I just actually had a thought when I
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
was you know when I was listening to
 
01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:45.299 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
um this back and forth could also
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.319 --> 01:06:01.549 align:start position:0%
 
mm-hmm

01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
seeing nothing further I will call the
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
question we will be voting on House Bill
 
01:06:10.089 --> 01:06:10.099 align:start position:0%
126 and act relative to choosing the
 
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
accrual which is kind of a pun date for
 
01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:16.140 align:start position:0%
child support payments moved by
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond seconded by
 
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton the motion before

thank you Mr chair

thank you Mr chair
um

01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
this bill just if you look at the bill
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's the Bold it says that the duration
 
01:13:03.970 --> 01:13:03.980 align:start position:0%
limits are under current RSA 458 colon
 
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
19-a and the formula limit under RSA 458
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
colon 19-a Roman 2.
 
01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
the duration limits under those two rsas
 
01:13:21.649 --> 01:13:21.659 align:start position:0%
unless a party seeking Terror temporary
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
alimony pleads and a court finds that
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
immediate and irreparable economic harm
 
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
would result If the percentage formula
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
formula were applied
 
01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
the court then shall make written
 
01:13:42.649 --> 01:13:42.659 align:start position:0%
findings supporting its orders this is
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh in in answer to the multitudes of
 
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
people who come before us and say that
 
01:13:54.729 --> 01:13:54.739 align:start position:0%
uh temporary uh alimony is financially
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh killing them uh it just is a
 
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
difficulty so if the current Formula
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't work the court can decide
 
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
um otherwise and and that's why this
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you any other discussion uh
 
01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford
 
01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
um going down those lines at one time I
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
think we put a limit of Five Years on
 
01:14:25.199 --> 01:14:26.390 align:start position:0%
think we put a limit of Five Years on
temporary

01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
alimony and this does this wouldn't um
 
01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
undo that with it
 
01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
you recall in the
 
01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
may I yes it does not mention anywhere
 
01:14:44.209 --> 01:14:44.219 align:start position:0%
in the bill that it would undo anything
 
01:14:49.729 --> 01:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond uh thank you Mr
 
01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.689 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond uh thank you Mr
chairman

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
um so I took the
 
01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
um testimony of New Hampshire legal aid
 
01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
um to heart when they came and and spoke
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
on this bill and I I did some research
 
01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
um on legal aid but then also on like
 
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
alimony and how this stuff is determined
 
01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
and what the you know how does a the
 
01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
case go through the court and I know we
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
all talked about this at length um that
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
day in a in regards to some other bills
 
01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
as well because I just didn't know a lot
 
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
about how
 
01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
um divorces proceeded
 
01:15:31.370 --> 01:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
um and so my concern continues in that
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
um the temporary hearing
 
01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
for where you establish temporary
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
custody Etc happens before all of that
 
01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
paperwork is filled out saying what
 
01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
people's income is saying like here's my
 
01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
pay stubs here's all that stuff and so I
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
think that it might be challenging to
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
put our judges in a position where they
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
have to apply a formula when they don't
 
01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
have the numbers to plug into the
 
01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
formula and that's my biggest
 
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
concern over this language
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
is you know I like the idea of a formula
 
01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
I think the formula is fair and
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate and I'm glad we have it in
 
01:16:10.729 --> 01:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
the final orders I'm sensitive to the
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:31.370 align:start position:0%

01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
one for myself personally and one for
 
01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:47.649 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:32:47.649 --> 01:32:47.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:52.129 --> 01:32:52.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
okay as we get going just want to point
 
01:32:57.649 --> 01:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
out that I believe there is a luncheon
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
today in the cafeteria sponsored by
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
AARP a wonderful group that never gets
 
01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:07.030 align:start position:0%
AARP a wonderful group that never gets
old

01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
old
 
01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.010 --> 01:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
opening the hearing now on House Bill
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
491 relative to prohibiting the use of
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
prone restraints for minors and the
 
01:33:24.649 --> 01:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes the prime sponsor of
 
01:33:26.930 --> 01:33:26.940 align:start position:0%
the bill representative David muse from
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and members
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
01:33:40.850 --> 01:33:40.860 align:start position:0%
what HB 491 would effectively do is uh
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
three things it would Define a dangerous
 
01:33:45.649 --> 01:33:45.659 align:start position:0%
restraint technique known as prone
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
restraint it would specifically prohibit
 
01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
its use on minor children in New
 
01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire schools and treatment
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
facilities and it would require that
 
01:33:58.850 --> 01:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
adults who use any form of restraint on
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
children be alert for signs of physical
 
01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
distress and to immediately stop
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
restraining the child that they
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
experience difficulty breathing choking
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
vomiting bleeding or really any physical
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
red flag or warning sign
 
01:34:17.689 --> 01:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
um prone restraint uh has become known
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
in in another context uh across the
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
United States in recent years it's also
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
a technique that is used by law
 
01:34:27.649 --> 01:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
enforcement and according to a Cornell
 
01:34:27.659 --> 01:34:29.090 align:start position:0%
enforcement and according to a Cornell
study

01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:29.100 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
um 79 fatalities I'm sorry according to
 
01:34:37.129 --> 01:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
uh uh according to the Centers for
 
01:34:38.770 --> 01:34:38.780 align:start position:0%
Disease Control
 
01:34:42.169 --> 01:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
prone restraint uh the use of prone
 
01:34:43.729 --> 01:34:43.739 align:start position:0%
restraint by law enforcement has
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
resulted in 107 deaths among adults
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
since 2010.
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
um but we're here today to talk about
 
01:34:56.209 --> 01:34:56.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
the the danger of prone restraint the
 
01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
danger of a of an adult often weighing
 
01:35:04.729 --> 01:35:04.739 align:start position:0%
over 200 pounds uh using this particular
 
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
technique on a child who may what weigh
 
01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
less uh than a hundred pounds is pretty
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
clear and Stark
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
um according to Cornell University
 
01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:14.709 align:start position:0%
um according to Cornell University
between

01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
1993 and 2018 there were 79 fatalities
 
01:35:23.209 --> 01:35:23.219 align:start position:0%
across the country uh at uh at
 
01:35:25.129 --> 01:35:25.139 align:start position:0%
facilities and schools that actually
 
01:35:28.850 --> 01:35:28.860 align:start position:0%
involve the use of prone restraint
 
01:35:32.209 --> 01:35:32.219 align:start position:0%
uh our own restraint how we're we
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to uh to determine if
 
01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
prone restraint has ever resulted in a
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
fatality in New Hampshire uh but we do
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
know that it's resulted in at least one
 
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
lawsuit uh in uh 2018 uh one of the
 
01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
residents at the sununu center was
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
slammed uh to the ground uh and held in
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
prone restraint in such a manner that
 
01:35:57.169 --> 01:35:57.179 align:start position:0%
resulted in uh the child breaking his
 
01:35:57.179 --> 01:35:58.310 align:start position:0%
resulted in uh the child breaking his
shoulder

01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
shoulder
 
01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:01.860 align:start position:0%
uh so this is something that uh that has
 
01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
happened that I think it shows um that
 
01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
not only is there a danger of death when
 
01:36:08.930 --> 01:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
a technique technique like this is used
 
01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
uh or employed uh there's also the
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
danger of a serious injury
 
01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:16.860 align:start position:0%
other people are going to testify today
 
01:36:21.169 --> 01:36:21.179 align:start position:0%
uh as to specifically how prone
 
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
restraint causes harm and how it causes
 
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
trauma in a child so I won't get into
 
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
that in my testimony but I did want to
 
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
let you know that the uh the bill and
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
the amendment that you've received this
 
01:36:36.010 --> 01:36:36.020 align:start position:0%
morning have been reviewed
 
01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
by the New Hampshire Medical Society the
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric Society the Pediatric
 
01:36:45.490 --> 01:36:45.500 align:start position:0%
Society the disability rights Center
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
dcyf uh and and several other
 
01:36:51.050 --> 01:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
organizations that will either be here
 
01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
today or offer online testimony
 
01:36:58.129 --> 01:36:58.139 align:start position:0%
um this is uh in in many respects uh
 
01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
this bill uh in some ways is a
 
01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill because our current
 
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
statute RSU uh uh our I'm sorry RSA 126u
 
01:37:12.649 --> 01:37:12.659 align:start position:0%
um actually does prohibit prone
 
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
restraint now uh the problem with the
 
01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
statute is it now stands is it doesn't
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
specifically call out or name prone
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
restraint by name as a prohibited
 
01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
technique it doesn't Define prone
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
restraint and the current statute also
 
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't set any guard rails on the use
 
01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
of restraint so for example a person
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
applying restraint there were there were
 
01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
no guard rails that uh that basically
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
tell that person when to stop you know
 
01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
when should you actually stop When does
 
01:37:53.209 --> 01:37:53.219 align:start position:0%
the when does uh uh when does the
 
01:37:55.490 --> 01:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
physical the stress of a child reached
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
the point where it's important to stop
 
01:38:00.050 --> 01:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
this before harm is done
 
01:38:02.330 --> 01:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
so essentially this building and and the
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
amendment address uh address these
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
issues the amendment itself uh is a is a
 
01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
full Bill Amendment
 
01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
um and what what it does is it changes
 
01:38:15.649 --> 01:38:15.659 align:start position:0%
uh the statement of findings to actually
 
01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
reflect the fact that the current
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
statute the way that it's worded
 
01:38:23.930 --> 01:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
actually can be read and interpreted to
 
01:38:25.930 --> 01:38:25.940 align:start position:0%
prohibit prone restraint
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
but one of the things we're trying to do
 
01:38:31.330 --> 01:38:31.340 align:start position:0%
with this bill is to close the ambiguity
 
01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the current policy is
 
01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
a force is enforced more consistently
 
01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:40.139 align:start position:0%
and effectively so that that's really
 
01:38:42.410 --> 01:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
the goal here the goal isn't to ban
 
01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
prone restraint because we think that
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
the current RSA already bans prone
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
restraint but what we're what we're
 
01:38:52.610 --> 01:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
really trying to do is just make it
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
crystal clear to everybody involved that
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
this is a prohibited technique in the
 
01:39:00.010 --> 01:39:00.020 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we don't want
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
facilities to use it and that when we
 
01:39:07.129 --> 01:39:07.139 align:start position:0%
apply any form of restraint we need to
 
01:39:09.770 --> 01:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
put the health of the child first
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
so that's that's essentially what we're
 
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
trying to do and I'd be happy to answer
 
01:39:16.610 --> 01:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee has the
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
chair has one I have three family
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
members who are in law enforcement and
 
01:39:23.810 --> 01:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
several who are in medicine and the
 
01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
concern is for their safety as well so
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
so I looked at this bill with that
 
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
prejudice in mind that I wish to keep
 
01:39:35.209 --> 01:39:35.219 align:start position:0%
those people safe especially from
 
01:39:38.090 --> 01:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
someone high on drugs and an older child
 
01:39:40.970 --> 01:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
who has great physical strength and what
 
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
I found pleased me in both your bill and
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment because it is talking
 
01:39:48.970 --> 01:39:48.980 align:start position:0%
about keeping someone in that position
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
indefinitely which circling back on my
 
01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
family said oh we agree with this we
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to keep it's if it is used it
 
01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
is used very transitorially along the
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
way to something else that is less
 
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
dangerous so having heard from all the
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
medical people and all the police people
 
01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
in my family who they signed off on this
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for this bill I'm glad to
 
01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
hear that would you believe I had to
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
make a question I would believe any
 
01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
other yes representative Bickford
 
01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:40:26.090 --> 01:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
um I I was noticing the same thing and
 
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
it's in your
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh italicized
 
01:40:32.810 --> 01:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
Edition here and you use the word uh in
 
01:40:34.729 --> 01:40:34.739 align:start position:0%
the first sentence prohibited uh
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
physical restraint and then you come
 
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
down here and talk in the next sentence
 
01:40:39.169 --> 01:40:39.179 align:start position:0%
about for the person's definition
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
physical restraint that involves a
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
temporary controlling of an individual
 
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
in a prone position now you accepted and
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
said yeah if we can do it temporarily
 
01:40:52.729 --> 01:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
however you need to start doing it as
 
01:40:54.169 --> 01:40:54.179 align:start position:0%
soon as possible basically what you're
 
01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
saying here so you you said it's okay to
 
01:40:58.250 --> 01:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
do it temporarily then you say it's
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
prohibited in the first sentence so I'm
 
01:41:01.310 --> 01:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
thinking well maybe saying it's
 
01:41:03.050 --> 01:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
prohibited and that is not the right
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
word to use that that should come out of
 
01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:06.530 align:start position:0%
word to use that that should come out of
it

01:41:06.530 --> 01:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that uh that I
 
01:41:11.570 --> 01:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
heard when I was doing research uh for
 
01:41:13.310 --> 01:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
the bill is that there are situations
 
01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:15.169 align:start position:0%
the bill is that there are situations
where

01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:15.179 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
um uh essentially sometimes it's
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
necessary uh for a staff member to
 
01:41:27.010 --> 01:41:27.020 align:start position:0%
almost tackle a person in order to
 
01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:29.639 align:start position:0%
prevent them from harming themselves or
 
01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
or harming another person so in in in
 
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
that context that's why the exception is
 
01:41:38.450 --> 01:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
there the the idea is
 
01:41:40.850 --> 01:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
um there may be times when a staff
 
01:41:44.649 --> 01:41:44.659 align:start position:0%
member may find themselves you know
 
01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
using you know effectively using this
 
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
that the child may be on uh you know
 
01:41:52.669 --> 01:41:52.679 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe on his stomach
 
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
um but the I think one of the things we
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to do is to provide clear
 
01:41:59.149 --> 01:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
direction that that is supposed to end
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible and you are to
 
01:42:04.250 --> 01:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
move to another form of restraint and
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that uh that
 
01:42:11.090 --> 01:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
dcyf actually issued a memo in 2019 uh
 
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
that actually discusses prone restraint
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and as a result of
 
01:42:18.290 --> 01:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
sending that memo out and we have a a
 
01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
person from dcyf here today as a result
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
of sending that uh that memo out uh
 
01:42:27.129 --> 01:42:27.139 align:start position:0%
several schools and treatment facilities
 
01:42:30.530 --> 01:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
have stopped using prone restraint uh
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
and in their in in the place of prone
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
restraint are using other safer
 
01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
techniques so I think that's the the one
 
01:42:41.090 --> 01:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
of the things that we do have to
 
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
navigate is that occasionally there are
 
01:42:46.010 --> 01:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
there are there's an need for the use of
 
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
this technique to protect the child to
 
01:42:52.330 --> 01:42:52.340 align:start position:0%
protect other people at the facility
 
01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
but the child's health and safety really
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
always has to come first and and I hope
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
that this language makes it clear that
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton I
 
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
think I'm just wondering if this is also
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
covers in homes like should there be
 
01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
domestic violence going on or you know
 
01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:23.340 align:start position:0%
for some reason
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
a restraint was used at home does this
 
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
also cover that
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
it does not
 
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:30.790 align:start position:0%
it does not
um

01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:33.709 --> 01:43:33.719 align:start position:0%
part of any of these restraint
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
techniques my understanding is that
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
facilities do train and have training
 
01:43:43.330 --> 01:43:43.340 align:start position:0%
programs uh for their staff members
 
01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
in the use of restraint
 
01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
the average parent probably wouldn't uh
 
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have that kind of training
 
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
right the average would you like a
 
01:43:56.450 --> 01:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes I would like awesome thank
 
01:44:00.169 --> 01:44:00.179 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome my concern is if we
 
01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
added language in to say that prone
 
01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
restraint was illegal in homes then that
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
could add a charge for someone who was
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
being domestically violent
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
so in other words there's not a need to
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
prone restraint a kid but because the of
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
an abusive individual that's in the
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
house they're using it as an act of
 
01:44:26.770 --> 01:44:26.780 align:start position:0%
power and control and by by
 
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
formulating that it's illegal then they
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
could be charged for such
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
and the the bill is the is now in the
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
hands of the committee to do whatever
 
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
the committee would like to do with it
 
01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:41.639 align:start position:0%
um what what I would say is um there are
 
01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
advantages to having a more focused and
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh and and narrower Bill uh in this
 
01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
particular case and that
 
01:44:52.729 --> 01:44:52.739 align:start position:0%
um this is a need to change uh and and
 
01:44:55.609 --> 01:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
and I think you know we have a we have a
 
01:44:57.169 --> 01:44:57.179 align:start position:0%
good Amendment a good bill in front of
 
01:44:57.179 --> 01:44:58.010 align:start position:0%
good Amendment a good bill in front of
us

01:44:58.010 --> 01:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
um that I that I hope a majority of
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
members on the committee uh can pass
 
01:45:05.689 --> 01:45:05.699 align:start position:0%
um my concern with what you raise is
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
that it might add another layer of
 
01:45:10.510 --> 01:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
complexity that might raise opposition
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh so it's sort of
 
01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
you know I don't think we ever want to
 
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
get in a situation where we want to
 
01:45:20.209 --> 01:45:20.219 align:start position:0%
sacrifice the good and favor of the
 
01:45:20.219 --> 01:45:21.590 align:start position:0%
sacrifice the good and favor of the
perfect

01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
representative Muse for coming to speak
 
01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
with us today and for taking my question
 
01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
um I have a question
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
um regarding
 
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
um RSA oh shoot I just lost it RSA
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
um 126 U
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
um and then there's a number of letters
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
after Roman numerals after that
 
01:45:49.850 --> 01:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
um which has a lot of definitions about
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
restraint already in it
 
01:45:53.159 --> 01:45:53.890 align:start position:0%
restraint already in it
um

01:45:53.890 --> 01:45:53.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
that RSA and part of I forget SB 324
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
something back in 2014 required
 
01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
um a certain level of training for
 
01:46:05.930 --> 01:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
individuals whose jobs require them to
 
01:46:08.330 --> 01:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
use restraint on children within this
 
01:46:11.810 --> 01:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
state do we know if the training that is
 
01:46:14.209 --> 01:46:14.219 align:start position:0%
being provided through CPI or other
 
01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
training providers covers not using
 
01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
prone restraint and is there a way that
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:46:23.629 --> 01:46:23.639 align:start position:0%
um like find that out or does do we need
 
01:46:25.729 --> 01:46:25.739 align:start position:0%
a bill that specifically says that that
 
01:46:27.709 --> 01:46:27.719 align:start position:0%
training would have to cover this
 
01:46:30.290 --> 01:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
particular type of restraint we actually
 
01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
have some folks who are going to testify
 
01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
later who are from facilities who who do
 
01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
not use prone restraint
 
01:46:39.229 --> 01:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
um what I would say is that does vary
 
01:46:41.930 --> 01:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
from facility to to facility and and
 
01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
part of the reason we're here is that
 
01:46:48.590 --> 01:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
um RSA 126u doesn't specifically
 
01:46:52.129 --> 01:46:52.139 align:start position:0%
prohibit prone restraint by name uh or
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
Define it so there's a little bit of
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
ambiguity and when you think about the
 
01:46:58.490 --> 01:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
complexity of training a person if
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about training a person
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
not to do prone restraint you can
 
01:47:03.890 --> 01:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
actually show them a picture of what it
 
01:47:05.689 --> 01:47:05.699 align:start position:0%
looks like and put a big X through it
 
01:47:07.490 --> 01:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
and say don't do that in big letters
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
right whereas the way that the current
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
statute is written you're sort of
 
01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
scratching your head going is this band
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
what's band what is it really Banning
 
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's any time it's it's a little
 
01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
complicated for for for training
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
purposes and and the potential is there
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
for it to be misunderstood or
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted and we're just really
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
trying to close that loop we're not
 
01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
changing the language so to speak of of
 
01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
that but you know that there's some good
 
01:47:38.330 --> 01:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
wording in there when it comes to all
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
forms of restraint
 
01:47:42.590 --> 01:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
um but uh we just want to make sure
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.410 --> 01:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for bringing us
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:47:55.490 --> 01:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
what oh hi
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman has a question
 
01:48:03.290 --> 01:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:04.970 --> 01:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Muse for
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward this is really
 
01:48:07.850 --> 01:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
important work
 
01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:08.570 align:start position:0%
important work
um

01:48:08.570 --> 01:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
initially I was going to ask about
 
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
training so what alternatives are being
 
01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
offered and it seems like we'll get some
 
01:48:17.090 --> 01:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
answers potentially to that later what
 
01:48:19.129 --> 01:48:19.139 align:start position:0%
would the consequence be
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
If This Were passed and someone did use
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
restraint in terms of a child's
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
um and I apologize if it's in here and I
 
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
didn't read that yet but so if we are
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
going to make it illegal you can't use
 
01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
it what happens if somebody in a
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
facility does use it
 
01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't change uh change
 
01:48:44.689 --> 01:48:44.699 align:start position:0%
penalties and and to be honest with you
 
01:48:46.609 --> 01:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
I've been so focused on that one part of
 
01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
the bill that I haven't been
 
01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
particularly focused on changing
 
01:48:52.490 --> 01:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
penalties or things like that I I do
 
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
think the uh there is someone here from
 
01:48:57.290 --> 01:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
dcyf who would be much more familiar
 
01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
with actually how this is enforced and
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're also hoping
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
to do with this bill is by by clarifying
 
01:49:06.890 --> 01:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
the policy
 
01:49:09.590 --> 01:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
um we're hoping to make it easier for
 
01:49:12.649 --> 01:49:12.659 align:start position:0%
dcyf uh to enforce this consistently
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
across the state I don't think the idea
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
is to to have people lose their jobs or
 
01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
criminally charge people or anything
 
01:49:22.370 --> 01:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
like that we just want people to
 
01:49:25.490 --> 01:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
understand the policy understand why we
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
have the policy in place
 
01:49:31.330 --> 01:49:31.340 align:start position:0%
so that essentially we're not
 
01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily putting kids who are
 
01:49:37.370 --> 01:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
already really vulnerable for one reason
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
or another it even more risk so that
 
01:49:45.250 --> 01:49:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.169 --> 01:49:48.179 align:start position:0%
anyone else from the committee for the
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative saying none thank you so
 
01:49:53.689 --> 01:49:53.699 align:start position:0%
much for presenting your bill and now we
 
01:49:55.729 --> 01:49:55.739 align:start position:0%
are going into the three-minute drill
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
which means 180 seconds
 
01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
and at three minutes I have a cutoff
 
01:50:05.209 --> 01:50:05.219 align:start position:0%
switch and your microphone goes dead and
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
I've already shared with the committee
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
the best speech I heard last year
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
speaking to a bill was 37 seconds long I
 
01:50:17.570 --> 01:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
owe that person two minutes plus
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
whenever she comes here
 
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
so with this three-minute bill limit
 
01:50:26.990 --> 01:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
please chair recognizes Holly Stevens
 
01:50:33.050 --> 01:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.290 --> 01:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
and she's got some handouts for all of
 
01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:50.810 align:start position:0%
and she's got some handouts for all of
us

01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:52.970 --> 01:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Pearson members of
 
01:50:54.410 --> 01:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Holly Stevens
 
01:50:55.970 --> 01:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of public policy for
 
01:50:58.609 --> 01:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
Nami New Hampshire Nami New Hampshire is
 
01:51:00.649 --> 01:51:00.659 align:start position:0%
a non-profit Grassroots organization
 
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
whose mission is to improve the lives of
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
all people
 
01:51:06.890 --> 01:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
who are impacted by mental illness and
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
suicide through support education and
 
01:51:12.050 --> 01:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
advocacy on behalf of Nami New Hampshire
 
01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to support uh House Bill
 
01:51:18.590 --> 01:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
491 relative to prohibiting the use of
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
prone restraints for minors
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
and our reading of the bill it appears
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
as you heard earlier that this is just a
 
01:51:28.250 --> 01:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
clarification of the law and not a
 
01:51:30.590 --> 01:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
change of the law
 
01:51:33.530 --> 01:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
um the the exact citation is New
 
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire RSA 126-u colon 4 I a through
 
01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
C at comma d
 
01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
um for us to know that prone restraints
 
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
are continuing to be used in the state
 
01:51:47.810 --> 01:51:47.820 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is extremely concerning
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
and the fact that this bill needs to be
 
01:51:52.149 --> 01:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
brought forward is extremely concerning
 
01:51:56.450 --> 01:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
I reviewed a research study that was a
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
26-year study of the user restraints on
 
01:52:00.530 --> 01:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
children and Facilities from 1993 to
 
01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:02.750 align:start position:0%
children and Facilities from 1993 to
2018.

01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
2018.
 
01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
they found that there were 63 deaths
 
01:52:07.250 --> 01:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
that were related to physical restraints
 
01:52:11.149 --> 01:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
and of those 63 deaths 38 were related
 
01:52:14.689 --> 01:52:14.699 align:start position:0%
to prone restraints but of note 19 of
 
01:52:17.689 --> 01:52:17.699 align:start position:0%
them the uh restraint right was
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
undetermined so again 38 of the 63 were
 
01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
prone and 19 were unknown we also know
 
01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:29.820 align:start position:0%
in a particular concern to Nami the
 
01:52:32.530 --> 01:52:32.540 align:start position:0%
physical restraints are used
 
01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
regularly with children in adolescents
 
01:52:36.649 --> 01:52:36.659 align:start position:0%
and Mental Health Care the study found
 
01:52:38.209 --> 01:52:38.219 align:start position:0%
that the deaths occurred with children
 
01:52:40.030 --> 01:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
in adolescence
 
01:52:42.850 --> 01:52:42.860 align:start position:0%
who were in psychiatric facilities
 
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
residential treatment facilities group
 
01:52:46.609 --> 01:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
homes foster homes and juvenile
 
01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities that was the
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
majority of the deaths
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh the evidence is clear that prone
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
restraints are dangerous and
 
01:52:55.609 --> 01:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affect Youth and
 
01:52:57.649 --> 01:52:57.659 align:start position:0%
mental health youth with mental health
 
01:52:59.149 --> 01:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
issues and should not be used on any
 
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
children adolescents therefore Nami New
 
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire urges the committee to vote
 
01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:06.540 align:start position:0%

from con to cook I only say that because
 
01:53:27.649 --> 01:53:27.659 align:start position:0%
it's taken me years to learn how to say
 
01:53:27.659 --> 01:53:48.350 align:start position:0%
it's taken me years to learn how to say
it

01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michael skibby
 
01:53:54.290 --> 01:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
um here to support the bill and the
 
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that is being proposed by
 
01:53:58.370 --> 01:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative Muse I was policy
 
01:53:59.810 --> 01:53:59.820 align:start position:0%
director at the disability rights Center
 
01:54:01.250 --> 01:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
when the child restraint law was
 
01:54:04.609 --> 01:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
originally passed in 2010
 
01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
um and then when it was uh substantially
 
01:54:09.169 --> 01:54:09.179 align:start position:0%
amended in 2014
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
my objective is to give you an
 
01:54:13.070 --> 01:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
understanding of the reasons for this
 
01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:14.810 align:start position:0%
understanding of the reasons for this
legislation

01:54:14.810 --> 01:54:14.820 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
um the legislation that led to the
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
current statute
 
01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
um and the reason that we uh really need
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
to adopt this bill to to clarify the
 
01:54:26.209 --> 01:54:26.219 align:start position:0%
current state of the law
 
01:54:29.209 --> 01:54:29.219 align:start position:0%
before 2010 our office at the disability
 
01:54:30.669 --> 01:54:30.679 align:start position:0%
rights Center
 
01:54:33.709 --> 01:54:33.719 align:start position:0%
was involved in a number of cases and
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
investigations of
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
um of restraint causing significant and
 
01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
serious injury to children in both
 
01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
public schools and treatment facilities
 
01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
at the same time there had been a
 
01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
growing National understanding of the
 
01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
inherent dangers of certain kinds of
 
01:54:52.129 --> 01:54:52.139 align:start position:0%
restraint including prone restraint
 
01:54:53.629 --> 01:54:53.639 align:start position:0%
the United States Department of
 
01:54:55.129 --> 01:54:55.139 align:start position:0%
Education had issued some guidance
 
01:54:59.390 --> 01:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
medical research had had become more
 
01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
sort of well understood
 
01:55:04.970 --> 01:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
and so senator scumbati who was the
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
former deputy director of the Department
 
01:55:09.229 --> 01:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services and had a
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
deep understanding of restraint and its
 
01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:12.310 align:start position:0%
deep understanding of restraint and its
dangers

01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
dangers
 
01:55:14.810 --> 01:55:14.820 align:start position:0%
sponsored the bill that led to current
 
01:55:16.669 --> 01:55:16.679 align:start position:0%
chapter 126u
 
01:55:19.010 --> 01:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
while the bill was being considered one
 
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
or two facilities that provided
 
01:55:23.649 --> 01:55:23.659 align:start position:0%
treatment to Children
 
01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:26.820 align:start position:0%
strongly objected to the use of the term
 
01:55:28.609 --> 01:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
prone restraint in the list of
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
prohibited techniques and they
 
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
maintained you know stridently and
 
01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
vociferously that you know
 
01:55:36.770 --> 01:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding everything that had
 
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
become known about the inherent dangers
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
of this technique that they could do it
 
01:55:43.310 --> 01:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
safely and
 
01:55:45.470 --> 01:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
um but at the same at the same time and
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
during the hearings that were ongoing
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
regarding the legislation the chief
 
01:55:51.890 --> 01:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
medical examiner of the state Dr Thomas
 
01:55:55.370 --> 01:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
Andrew who is here today testified in
 
01:55:57.470 --> 01:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
detail about what exactly happens to
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
someone when they're subjected to this
 
01:56:01.010 --> 01:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
technique and how dangerous it really is
 
01:56:04.010 --> 01:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
I mean here's among other things that it
 
01:56:05.330 --> 01:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
interferes with the movement that's
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
required for normal breathing
 
01:56:10.490 --> 01:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
Senators combati was very concerned
 
01:56:12.590 --> 01:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
about the objections that were being
 
01:56:15.709 --> 01:56:15.719 align:start position:0%
raised but it was also very committed to
 
01:56:18.290 --> 01:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
the prohibition on prone and so she
 
01:56:20.209 --> 01:56:20.219 align:start position:0%
asked us develop language
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
that would address dangerous restraint
 
01:56:25.850 --> 01:56:25.860 align:start position:0%
techniques and positions without using
 
01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
that term that was triggering so much
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
objection and so uh my colleague now
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley and Dr Andrew and I
 
01:56:40.129 --> 01:56:40.139 align:start position:0%
consulted about how to do accomplish
 
01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
that and we came up with the language
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
that is in the current statute that I
 
01:56:46.250 --> 01:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
distributed to you just now and I've had
 
01:56:48.590 --> 01:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
15 seconds to close please I've
 
01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
highlighted the sections that
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
um I think address and I think if you
 
01:56:55.370 --> 01:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
imagine yourself being face down on a
 
01:56:57.070 --> 01:56:57.080 align:start position:0%
hard surface like a floor or a table
 
01:56:59.629 --> 01:56:59.639 align:start position:0%
that it would definitely do the things
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
that this prohibits it would cause
 
01:57:03.530 --> 01:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
compression of the chest it would impair
 
01:57:04.689 --> 01:57:04.699 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
movement that's required for normal
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
breathing so we do believe that it does
 
01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
prohibit it but that unfortunately some
 
01:57:13.970 --> 01:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
facilities are still using it we ask you
 
01:57:16.450 --> 01:57:16.460 align:start position:0%
to to adopt this or to
 
01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
recommend passage of this bill so that
 
01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
we can further protect the children
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for Mr skibby
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:30.239 --> 01:57:33.169 align:start position:0%
 
microphone

01:57:33.169 --> 01:57:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:36.410 --> 01:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
my concern my is the word temporary is
 
01:57:38.209 --> 01:57:38.219 align:start position:0%
in here we're prohibited from doing
 
01:57:39.709 --> 01:57:39.719 align:start position:0%
something then we said we can't do it
 
01:57:42.410 --> 01:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
temporarily how long is temporarily I
 
01:57:46.910 --> 01:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
think that um if I can grab it here
 
01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:49.850 align:start position:0%
think that um if I can grab it here
um

01:57:49.850 --> 01:57:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:52.669 --> 01:57:52.679 align:start position:0%
I think that the key phrase for me in
 
01:57:55.970 --> 01:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
understanding that sentence is that it's
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
the temporary controlling while
 
01:57:59.450 --> 01:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
transitioning to an alternative safer
 
01:58:01.490 --> 01:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
form of restraint and what the way I
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
think about this is that when you
 
01:58:06.290 --> 01:58:06.300 align:start position:0%
initially engage physically with a child
 
01:58:11.089 --> 01:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
that is upset maybe you know in
 
01:58:12.890 --> 01:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
um in a fight with someone or something
 
01:58:15.530 --> 01:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
like that that it takes a little bit
 
01:58:18.350 --> 01:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
maybe just seconds to gain control of
 
01:58:20.209 --> 01:58:20.219 align:start position:0%
the situation and you may find yourself
 
01:58:21.890 --> 01:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
with hands on a child with their face
 
01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
down and that could be considered a
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
technical violation of of this language
 
01:58:29.089 --> 01:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
so I think that adding this language
 
01:58:30.830 --> 01:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that as you're gaining
 
01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:31.970 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that as you're gaining
control

01:58:31.970 --> 01:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:58:34.129 --> 01:58:34.139 align:start position:0%
you may have a kid face down but you
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
would not thereby be violating the
 
01:58:37.390 --> 01:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
statute that's how I understand
 
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
transitioning is exactly yeah I think so
 
01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any further questions
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
from Mr Scooby
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you so much are you
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%

Rosenberg from the disability rights
 
01:59:09.410 --> 01:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:11.330 --> 01:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
01:59:13.129 --> 01:59:13.139 align:start position:0%
I'm Karen Rosenberg the policy director
 
01:59:14.810 --> 01:59:14.820 align:start position:0%
of the disability rights Center I'm
 
01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of HB 491 on
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
behalf of the disability rights Center
 
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
as well as the juvenile reform policy
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
Group which is a coalition of
 
01:59:24.109 --> 01:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
organizations that advocate for the
 
01:59:25.609 --> 01:59:25.619 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of our children
 
01:59:27.649 --> 01:59:27.659 align:start position:0%
that includes New Hampshire legal
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
assistance Waypoint new Futures the
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
children's Law Center of New Hampshire
 
01:59:34.850 --> 01:59:34.860 align:start position:0%
and the ACLU of New Hampshire so first I
 
01:59:36.050 --> 01:59:36.060 align:start position:0%
think it's really important for everyone
 
01:59:38.089 --> 01:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
to realize there is no evidence-based
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
research that supports using restraint
 
01:59:42.890 --> 01:59:42.900 align:start position:0%
as a therapeutic intervention we're
 
01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
talking about situations that are
 
01:59:46.250 --> 01:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
emergencies when no other less
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
restrictive less onerous
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
technique can be used to control a child
 
01:59:54.109 --> 01:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
who's in a school or a facility and so
 
01:59:57.050 --> 01:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative I think it was Moulton
 
01:59:59.089 --> 01:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
asked the question about how it would it
 
02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
potentially impact families this is not
 
02:00:03.050 --> 02:00:03.060 align:start position:0%
a bill that impacts families this law
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
only regulates the use of restrain or
 
02:00:08.089 --> 02:00:08.099 align:start position:0%
seclusion in schools and treatment
 
02:00:09.770 --> 02:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
facilities and Foster treatment
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
facilities okay so
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
um as as you've heard our law currently
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
prohibits use of dangerous restoring
 
02:00:20.330 --> 02:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
techniques which includes prone but
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
where and for the most part facilities
 
02:00:25.070 --> 02:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
and schools are successfully managing
 
02:00:27.050 --> 02:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
even dangerous children's Behavior
 
02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
without using this technique even
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
facilities that are under contract with
 
02:00:33.410 --> 02:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
our Department of Health and Human
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
Services that are like level four really
 
02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know very challenging children have
 
02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
figured out how to address really
 
02:00:42.589 --> 02:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
dangerous situations using safer
 
02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:43.980 align:start position:0%
techniques when they need to put their
 
02:00:46.250 --> 02:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
hands on a child but it's come to our
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
attention that there are some outliers
 
02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
that it didn't really get the memo and
 
02:00:51.770 --> 02:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
don't really interpret the law the way
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
it was intended and so since the passage
 
02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
of the law we have become aware of
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
situations where children have suffered
 
02:01:00.649 --> 02:01:00.659 align:start position:0%
serious injuries due to the use of prone
 
02:01:03.290 --> 02:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
restraint including one where a child
 
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
suffered a broken a fractured scapula in
 
02:01:08.089 --> 02:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
your shoulder blade another in which a
 
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
student lost Consciousness for a period
 
02:01:13.250 --> 02:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
of time during the course of a prone
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
restraint so we want to make sure that
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
it is abundantly clear that we mean it
 
02:01:21.709 --> 02:01:21.719 align:start position:0%
we should not be using dangerous
 
02:01:23.810 --> 02:01:23.820 align:start position:0%
restraints on vulnerable children that's
 
02:01:26.510 --> 02:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
really what this is about so
 
02:01:28.970 --> 02:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
um and and also that if a child is in
 
02:01:30.830 --> 02:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
any kind of restraint that the person
 
02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
involved in that restraint needs to pay
 
02:01:34.010 --> 02:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
attention to their health and well-being
 
02:01:37.070 --> 02:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
and so that's why there's also in this
 
02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:38.089 align:start position:0%
and so that's why there's also in this
amendment

02:01:38.089 --> 02:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:01:39.530 --> 02:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
um I think in the original bill there's
 
02:01:41.810 --> 02:01:41.820 align:start position:0%
a requirement that the child's physical
 
02:01:44.209 --> 02:01:44.219 align:start position:0%
condition be paid attention to so that
 
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
they can be released if there's any sign
 
02:01:47.149 --> 02:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
of distress
 
02:01:50.570 --> 02:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
so I am and and I if I have time to
 
02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
answer a couple of questions that were
 
02:01:54.169 --> 02:01:54.179 align:start position:0%
raised I think representative
 
02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
um Raymond maybe asked about complaints
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
and like what would happened to someone
 
02:02:00.050 --> 02:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
is that you know you asked about
 
02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:01.129 align:start position:0%
is that you know you asked about
training

02:02:01.129 --> 02:02:01.139 align:start position:0%
training
 
02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
um so there is a requirement that the
 
02:02:06.109 --> 02:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Education in New Hampshire
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
um Department of Labor in this it's in
 
02:02:10.250 --> 02:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
the current law assist with training
 
02:02:12.890 --> 02:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
materials and any reputable training
 
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
organization is going to train facility
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
operators and schools to avoid the use
 
02:02:21.010 --> 02:02:21.020 align:start position:0%
of restraint whenever possible to apply
 
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
research-based you know Alternatives
 
02:02:25.010 --> 02:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
that will help the child to learn to
 
02:02:27.229 --> 02:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
regulate and de-escalate and will be in
 
02:02:29.330 --> 02:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
Conformity with our state law
 
02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
and I think it was representative
 
02:02:32.570 --> 02:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
Grossman that asked about well what's
 
02:02:33.709 --> 02:02:33.719 align:start position:0%
going to happen to these people we
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
already have
 
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
um processes under that's required by
 
02:02:39.890 --> 02:02:39.900 align:start position:0%
state law and now in state rule for
 
02:02:42.109 --> 02:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
complaints to be filed that's and I
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
think RSA 126 u9 and that caused I mean
 
02:02:49.010 --> 02:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
so under those it's u9 and u8 depending
 
02:02:50.930 --> 02:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
whether it's a school or a facility
 
02:02:52.970 --> 02:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
that's overseen by the Department of
 
02:02:54.890 --> 02:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services so there's a
 
02:02:56.450 --> 02:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
requirement that there be investigation
 
02:02:59.149 --> 02:02:59.159 align:start position:0%
process and a process for addressing the
 
02:03:00.770 --> 02:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
you know what injuries the child may
 
02:03:02.930 --> 02:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
have suffered as a result so I hope that
 
02:03:04.370 --> 02:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
answered your questions I hope I kept it
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
under three minutes
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
actually your speech was under three
 
02:03:09.850 --> 02:03:09.860 align:start position:0%
minutes and then you answered questions
 
02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:15.770 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
panic

02:03:15.770 --> 02:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
what is the definition of a child of age
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
wise well it depends if they're still in
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
school or not so for
 
02:03:25.790 --> 02:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna I actually need to look at
 
02:03:29.089 --> 02:03:29.099 align:start position:0%
it so for for children who are generally
 
02:03:33.649 --> 02:03:33.659 align:start position:0%
it's under 18 years of age however if a
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
child is either in the juvenile justice
 
02:03:37.609 --> 02:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
system and is voluntarily extended their
 
02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of course jurisdiction
 
02:03:40.970 --> 02:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
because they have not obtained a regular
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
high school diploma or they're in school
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
in you know through the public school
 
02:03:46.370 --> 02:03:46.380 align:start position:0%
system because they've not earned a
 
02:03:48.830 --> 02:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
diploma then they would and they're less
 
02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
than 22 years of age those those
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
individuals would also be covered by the
 
02:03:56.209 --> 02:03:56.219 align:start position:0%
definition of child it's meant to
 
02:03:58.129 --> 02:03:58.139 align:start position:0%
regulate what happens in schools and
 
02:03:58.139 --> 02:03:59.750 align:start position:0%
regulate what happens in schools and
Facilities

02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
Facilities
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
one follow-up
 
02:04:06.050 --> 02:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
so if a child came into school who's
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
20 years old
 
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
the school's definition of a child with
 
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
a gun
 
02:04:15.649 --> 02:04:15.659 align:start position:0%
and the child needs to be restrained
 
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't restrict that type no this
 
02:04:20.689 --> 02:04:20.699 align:start position:0%
does not prohibit schools from using
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
restraint okay restraint can be used
 
02:04:27.410 --> 02:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
and what this says though is that we
 
02:04:29.330 --> 02:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
can't we should not be using dangerous
 
02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
restraints on people and prone restraint
 
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
which is actually prohibited under our
 
02:04:38.810 --> 02:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
law given how our law defines dangerous
 
02:04:40.729 --> 02:04:40.739 align:start position:0%
restraint should not be the go-to
 
02:04:43.010 --> 02:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
restraint so if someone needs to be
 
02:04:44.810 --> 02:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
restrained and that's a very dangerous
 
02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
situation if that's the intervention
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in our current law or if
 
02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
the law is amended that would prevent
 
02:04:53.689 --> 02:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
that from happening with a goal as
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible to move to less
 
02:04:57.950 --> 02:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
dangerous if they were if they were if
 
02:05:00.290 --> 02:05:00.300 align:start position:0%
the if the restraint ended up in a take
 
02:05:02.689 --> 02:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
down to the floor and the person ended
 
02:05:05.689 --> 02:05:05.699 align:start position:0%
up face down then yes the goal would be
 
02:05:08.209 --> 02:05:08.219 align:start position:0%
to put them in a safer position and
 
02:05:09.410 --> 02:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
contain them
 
02:05:11.689 --> 02:05:11.699 align:start position:0%
take away the gun any further questions
 
02:05:13.750 --> 02:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
for Ms Rosenberg
 
02:05:16.970 --> 02:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond uh thank you Mr
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Miss Rosenberg
 
02:05:21.770 --> 02:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
um I think it might be helpful
 
02:05:22.910 --> 02:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
um for the community and it would be
 
02:05:24.410 --> 02:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
helpful for me
 
02:05:26.810 --> 02:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
um are you able to give us some examples
 
02:05:28.930 --> 02:05:28.940 align:start position:0%
or perhaps another speaker I'm not sure
 
02:05:32.330 --> 02:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
of situations where restraint is used
 
02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:34.129 align:start position:0%
of situations where restraint is used
currently

02:05:34.129 --> 02:05:34.139 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:05:36.770 --> 02:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
um in school settings or
 
02:05:39.050 --> 02:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
um group treatment settings
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
um like a situation where
 
02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
um people are trained to use restraint
 
02:05:46.189 --> 02:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
that is appropriate to use a restraint
 
02:05:48.890 --> 02:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
so for example like when I hear this I
 
02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
don't think of someone coming in with a
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
gun that to me is a law enforcement
 
02:05:55.129 --> 02:05:55.139 align:start position:0%
response I think of this as a child with
 
02:05:58.550 --> 02:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
a meltdown am I on the wrong track yeah
 
02:06:00.890 --> 02:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of and I hope I'm never
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
aware of a situation with a gun but so
 
02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
it's a situation in which a child's
 
02:06:09.950 --> 02:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
behavior is such that they pose in a
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
substantial imminent risk of causing
 
02:06:15.229 --> 02:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
serious bodily harm to either themselves
 
02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
or someone else that's what they'll have
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
the law defines it so as an illustration
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
um there's some altercation between two
 
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
students and one student is you know
 
02:06:28.070 --> 02:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
really wailing on another student right
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
so they're going to hurt them a staff
 
02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
member could separate the children and
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
and and in doing so hold on and maybe
 
02:06:38.750 --> 02:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
with another staff member too to the to
 
02:06:42.649 --> 02:06:42.659 align:start position:0%
the child and to you know to eliminate
 
02:06:45.169 --> 02:06:45.179 align:start position:0%
that to try to control that risk and
 
02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
hold on to the child if assuming they're
 
02:06:49.370 --> 02:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
still flailing and dangerous does that
 
02:06:52.010 --> 02:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
help you yes it does I'm just I'm trying
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
to Envision the circumstances in which
 
02:06:56.930 --> 02:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
this happens so you know a fight at
 
02:06:58.490 --> 02:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
school or I'm thinking in elementary
 
02:07:01.490 --> 02:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
school child who's you know having a an
 
02:07:02.810 --> 02:07:02.820 align:start position:0%
issue of throwing things or something
 
02:07:05.209 --> 02:07:05.219 align:start position:0%
like we've seen situations with kids
 
02:07:07.490 --> 02:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
like with autism who have sort of a
 
02:07:10.129 --> 02:07:10.139 align:start position:0%
flight or fight response and so we've
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
over the years that I've been at DRC
 
02:07:14.629 --> 02:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
we've had such relations where child
 
02:07:16.930 --> 02:07:16.940 align:start position:0%
bolts so they're like in the playground
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
and something interests them or
 
02:07:21.290 --> 02:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
something's going on and they're bolting
 
02:07:23.570 --> 02:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
towards the street and so that would be
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
dangerous and a staff member and teacher
 
02:07:29.450 --> 02:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
could then you know grab the kid in a
 
02:07:31.189 --> 02:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
safe position and prevent them from
 
02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
bolting into the street that might be
 
02:07:34.910 --> 02:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
another example that comes out pretty
 
02:07:37.729 --> 02:07:37.739 align:start position:0%
regularly representative Moulton thank
 
02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:40.380 align:start position:0%

of the bills so may ask questions of the
 
02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor only but no one else
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I meant to do that I
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
forgot that great but
 
02:08:04.250 --> 02:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:05.689 --> 02:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll tell you later about how
 
02:08:08.689 --> 02:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
representative knurk and I almost got
 
02:08:12.649 --> 02:08:12.659 align:start position:0%
thrown out for doing it but I'll tell
 
02:08:16.370 --> 02:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
you yes anyone else for
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
oh I'll tell everybody
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
Jerry wanted to ask a question and he
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't so he slipped me a piece of
 
02:08:24.530 --> 02:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
paper and I'm reading it as if it were
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
my question but Jerry is a doctor so
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
halfway through the question I said
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
what's that word at which point I
 
02:08:33.950 --> 02:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
totally outed both of us
 
02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:35.229 align:start position:0%
totally outed both of us
foreign

02:08:35.229 --> 02:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:08:37.490 --> 02:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
story and I've learned something today I
 
02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that that was um
 
02:08:41.930 --> 02:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
prohibited so thank you
 
02:08:44.930 --> 02:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
so um you know this is Fox guarding Hen
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
House chairmanship here all right any
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
other questions for uh Miss Rosenberg
 
02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:50.330 align:start position:0%
other questions for uh Miss Rosenberg
from

02:08:50.330 --> 02:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who can ask them thank you
 
02:08:57.290 --> 02:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone chair recognizes uh
 
02:09:01.790 --> 02:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:09.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson and thank you
 
02:09:13.970 --> 02:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
to the committee for hosting me this
 
02:09:16.370 --> 02:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
morning my name is Tom Andrew I'm a
 
02:09:19.250 --> 02:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
forensic pathologist and served the
 
02:09:20.570 --> 02:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
granite state as your chief medical
 
02:09:25.250 --> 02:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
examiner from 1997 to 2017. now since
 
02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
retirement from State service I've
 
02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
remained active as a forensic
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
pathologist as a consultant and in
 
02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
teaching now I did not testify before
 
02:09:36.669 --> 02:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
our legislative committees very often
 
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
in my 20 years as chief medical examiner
 
02:09:41.629 --> 02:09:41.639 align:start position:0%
I reserved those times for
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
when I felt strongly about the issue at
 
02:09:45.709 --> 02:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
hand and when I thought I really had
 
02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
some legitimate expertise to offer
 
02:09:53.209 --> 02:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
over a decade ago I testified on the
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
dangers of prone restraint and I'm back
 
02:09:59.270 --> 02:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
today to support HB 491's aim to
 
02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
prohibit prone restraint specifically by
 
02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:04.189 align:start position:0%
prohibit prone restraint specifically by
name

02:10:04.189 --> 02:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
name
 
02:10:07.850 --> 02:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
that prone restraint is still used due
 
02:10:09.770 --> 02:10:09.780 align:start position:0%
to language vagaries in the current law
 
02:10:13.070 --> 02:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
is an anathema to one who has seen
 
02:10:15.649 --> 02:10:15.659 align:start position:0%
firsthand fatal results from the use of
 
02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
this technique as far back as 1996.
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
forensic Pathologists alerted by Don Ray
 
02:10:25.070 --> 02:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh chief medical examiner in Seattle
 
02:10:27.290 --> 02:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
began to recognize the inhibition of
 
02:10:29.570 --> 02:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
effective ventilation during prone
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
restraint as it involves two key factors
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
in the physiology of respiration or
 
02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:35.930 align:start position:0%
in the physiology of respiration or
breathing

02:10:35.930 --> 02:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
breathing
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
movement of the ribs and movement of the
 
02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:40.070 align:start position:0%
movement of the ribs and movement of the
diaphragm

02:10:40.070 --> 02:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
diaphragm
 
02:10:43.970 --> 02:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
now prone restraint re restricts rib
 
02:10:46.970 --> 02:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
movement particularly and especially but
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
not exclusively
 
02:10:51.709 --> 02:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
if weight is applied to the person's
 
02:10:51.719 --> 02:10:53.089 align:start position:0%
if weight is applied to the person's
back

02:10:53.089 --> 02:10:53.099 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:10:55.370 --> 02:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
now obesity of the victim of a fatal
 
02:10:58.070 --> 02:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
episode of prone restraint not uncommon
 
02:10:59.330 --> 02:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
I might add
 
02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
is an exacerbating Factor because it
 
02:11:04.250 --> 02:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
pushes the abdominal contents upward
 
02:11:05.870 --> 02:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
restricting the movement of the
 
02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
diaphragm now these anatomic factors
 
02:11:11.629 --> 02:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
reduce respiratory volume the amount of
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
air that you exchange limitation of
 
02:11:15.169 --> 02:11:15.179 align:start position:0%
respiratory volume may be of no
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
significance to a healthy person at rest
 
02:11:21.410 --> 02:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
this is the apparent basis of the
 
02:11:23.330 --> 02:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
misguided notion that this technique can
 
02:11:25.490 --> 02:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
be practiced safely
 
02:11:28.129 --> 02:11:28.139 align:start position:0%
but the circumstances of fatal cases
 
02:11:30.109 --> 02:11:30.119 align:start position:0%
seen hundreds of times by forensic
 
02:11:31.970 --> 02:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
Pathologists around the country and
 
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
several times by me personally
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
are very different
 
02:11:38.450 --> 02:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
the victim has nearly always been
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
involved in a high intense physical
 
02:11:43.970 --> 02:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
activity that prompted and the restraint
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
in the first place and then actively
 
02:11:48.290 --> 02:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
resisted the restraint even after being
 
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
subdued they continue to struggle
 
02:11:52.609 --> 02:11:52.619 align:start position:0%
incurring further oxygen debt now
 
02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
additionally this victim is subjected to
 
02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
high levels of circulating adrenaline
 
02:11:59.570 --> 02:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
due to their emotional arousal mental
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
illness or as can be seen in encounters
 
02:12:03.770 --> 02:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement
 
02:12:06.350 --> 02:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh the use of illicit stimulant drugs
 
02:12:08.810 --> 02:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
now adrenaline in excess has an
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
irritated effect on the heart
 
02:12:13.010 --> 02:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
and the heart's ability to conduct
 
02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
normal electrical impulses is impaired
 
02:12:18.169 --> 02:12:18.179 align:start position:0%
and this is an unpredictable factor that
 
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
can bring about very sudden unexpected
 
02:12:22.669 --> 02:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
lethal arrhythmias or electrical
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
short-circuiting of the heart please
 
02:12:27.169 --> 02:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
wrap it up doctor about 15 seconds they
 
02:12:29.149 --> 02:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
can kill in seconds
 
02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
an experience has taught us that the
 
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
level of restricted ventilation that
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
might be harmless to a healthy person at
 
02:12:39.169 --> 02:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
rest may be in such circumstances fatal
 
02:12:41.330 --> 02:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
and this is not a novel Theory
 
02:12:44.169 --> 02:12:44.179 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive review of restraint
 
02:12:47.570 --> 02:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
deaths in 2021 in Medicine Science and
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
the law highlighted this
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
underappreciated aspect of prone
 
02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:53.209 align:start position:0%
underappreciated aspect of prone
restraint

02:12:53.209 --> 02:12:53.219 align:start position:0%
restraint
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.169 --> 02:13:00.179 align:start position:0%
well we just got a ruling from on high
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
and it says that unless you are
 
02:13:07.669 --> 02:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
testifying you may ask questions so the
 
02:13:10.189 --> 02:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
connect Pearson protocol has been
 
02:13:12.850 --> 02:13:12.860 align:start position:0%
replaced any questions for the doctor
 
02:13:15.530 --> 02:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
02:13:18.589 --> 02:13:18.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Doctor oops thank you thank
 
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
you doctor for your testimony uh the
 
02:13:23.689 --> 02:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
questions sir
 
02:13:25.729 --> 02:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
well I could have your people call my
 
02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
people and we get a minute I'll think
 
02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
um doctor with with respect uh I I mean
 
02:13:33.770 --> 02:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
looking at this I've always thought of
 
02:13:36.169 --> 02:13:36.179 align:start position:0%
restraints uh if they're on their back
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
and some of that consistent with what
 
02:13:41.569 --> 02:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
you said when they're on their face I
 
02:13:43.609 --> 02:13:43.619 align:start position:0%
mean I would think a larger person on
 
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
their back would have that
 
02:13:50.569 --> 02:13:50.579 align:start position:0%
breath have you seen instances of uh
 
02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
people on their back restrained
 
02:13:56.169 --> 02:13:56.179 align:start position:0%
um that are uh detrimental to their
 
02:13:58.609 --> 02:13:58.619 align:start position:0%
breathing or their health on their back
 
02:14:02.629 --> 02:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
that supine restraint yeah okay I didn't
 
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
know that's what it was called well
 
02:14:06.169 --> 02:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
that's if you're on your back you're
 
02:14:08.450 --> 02:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
supine okay if you're face down you're
 
02:14:13.569 --> 02:14:13.579 align:start position:0%
prone prone is inherently dangerous so
 
02:14:13.579 --> 02:14:15.350 align:start position:0%
prone prone is inherently dangerous so
restraint

02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
restraint
 
02:14:19.129 --> 02:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
of any kind incurs risk
 
02:14:22.669 --> 02:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
prone restraint when you're face down is
 
02:14:25.069 --> 02:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
inherently dangerous
 
02:14:28.390 --> 02:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
if I had a choice I would prefer to be
 
02:14:32.569 --> 02:14:32.579 align:start position:0%
restrained supine face up okay great
 
02:14:36.109 --> 02:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:38.450 --> 02:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
02:14:40.250 --> 02:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
so it's of your opinion that no matter
 
02:14:42.350 --> 02:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
how good the training is anything that
 
02:14:45.169 --> 02:14:45.179 align:start position:0%
this prone is is a problem it's not my
 
02:14:48.050 --> 02:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
opinion I think that it is the uh
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
consensus of evidence-based medicine I'm
 
02:14:54.649 --> 02:14:54.659 align:start position:0%
merely representing what uh what the
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
literature supports thank you so much
 
02:15:01.189 --> 02:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
representative panic thank you for thank
 
02:15:03.410 --> 02:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
you chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
question a little closer to the mic
 
02:15:08.450 --> 02:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
please sorry thank you
 
02:15:10.850 --> 02:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
is the amount of pressure
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
given to the person being restrained in
 
02:15:18.830 --> 02:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
prone position a determining Factor on
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
the severity of the injury it is death
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
it is not a determining factor and
 
02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
that's why I said especially and
 
02:15:29.330 --> 02:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
particularly but not exclusively
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
in the prone position
 
02:15:34.250 --> 02:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
even without extra weight being added
 
02:15:36.109 --> 02:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
onto the back which is a rarity in these
 
02:15:37.729 --> 02:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
situations there's almost always
 
02:15:39.950 --> 02:15:39.960 align:start position:0%

02:15:42.350 --> 02:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
where the back or the abdomen but even
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
without that rib motion rib movement
 
02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
against an unyielding surface like the
 
02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
floor even a carpeted floor
 
02:15:55.970 --> 02:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
is still a significant factor and what
 
02:15:58.609 --> 02:15:58.619 align:start position:0%
does not what is not accounted for here
 
02:16:03.169 --> 02:16:03.179 align:start position:0%
is the potential cardiac toxicity of
 
02:16:06.890 --> 02:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
excess adrenaline that's why
 
02:16:10.970 --> 02:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
that's why the restrained individual
 
02:16:13.550 --> 02:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
even if in quotation marks is being
 
02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:15.410 align:start position:0%
even if in quotation marks is being
monitored

02:16:15.410 --> 02:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
monitored
 
02:16:17.950 --> 02:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
they can have a sudden lethal arrhythmia
 
02:16:20.569 --> 02:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
leading to Heart stoppage even if they
 
02:16:22.729 --> 02:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
are clearly breathing
 
02:16:24.290 --> 02:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
right up to the moment that they stop
 
02:16:26.569 --> 02:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
that their heart stops this this is not
 
02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
predictable they're not blue
 
02:16:32.330 --> 02:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
and if they have a lethal cardiac
 
02:16:32.340 --> 02:16:33.530 align:start position:0%
and if they have a lethal cardiac
arrhythmia

02:16:33.530 --> 02:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
arrhythmia
 
02:16:35.450 --> 02:16:35.460 align:start position:0%
now the game's over before anybody can
 
02:16:37.009 --> 02:16:37.019 align:start position:0%
do about it often before before they
 
02:16:38.389 --> 02:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
even realize it because they're looking
 
02:16:41.450 --> 02:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
for cyanosis or blueness in the face or
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
stoppage of breathing
 
02:16:47.290 --> 02:16:47.300 align:start position:0%

representative Moulton with her Newfound
 
02:16:53.810 --> 02:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
Freedom thank you Mr chairman uh for for
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
one thank you representative DeSimone
 
02:16:58.429 --> 02:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
for reminding me that I was a co-sponsor
 
02:17:00.049 --> 02:17:00.059 align:start position:0%
of this bill because that was back in
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
December and
 
02:17:04.610 --> 02:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
I just I knew I had co-sponsored some
 
02:17:07.370 --> 02:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
bills but uh this one in particular but
 
02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
regardless I'm a registered nurse uh we
 
02:17:13.009 --> 02:17:13.019 align:start position:0%
do restrain patients and I would wanted
 
02:17:15.290 --> 02:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
to make a comment that I have to word as
 
02:17:17.209 --> 02:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
a question so if you would believe that
 
02:17:20.570 --> 02:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
in hospitals in
 
02:17:26.150 --> 02:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
adult care only restrain patients that
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
are confused and violent or just violent
 
02:17:33.770 --> 02:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
um that's the only time where we
 
02:17:36.049 --> 02:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
restrain adult patients so they have to
 
02:17:39.169 --> 02:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
be a threat to themselves or others and
 
02:17:41.389 --> 02:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
in the adult setting we don't use prone
 
02:17:43.610 --> 02:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
restraints like ever
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
um so and then the other caveat to that
 
02:17:49.310 --> 02:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
is that we need to release them as soon
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
as they are calm
 
02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
because they we don't restrain people
 
02:17:56.509 --> 02:17:56.519 align:start position:0%
that don't need to be restrained so
 
02:17:58.190 --> 02:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
um that's been the policy everywhere
 
02:18:01.870 --> 02:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
that I've worked so
 
02:18:05.929 --> 02:18:05.939 align:start position:0%
and just to so I was just saying you
 
02:18:07.969 --> 02:18:07.979 align:start position:0%
know I was aiming it it was more of a
 
02:18:09.950 --> 02:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
comment than a question but you're
 
02:18:11.450 --> 02:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
wondering if the good doctor believes
 
02:18:13.849 --> 02:18:13.859 align:start position:0%
this would you believe that what what I
 
02:18:17.570 --> 02:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
testify having autopsied an individual
 
02:18:19.849 --> 02:18:19.859 align:start position:0%
who died in prone restraint in a health
 
02:18:22.669 --> 02:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
care facility here in New Hampshire and
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
seeing that policy in that facility
 
02:18:28.849 --> 02:18:28.859 align:start position:0%
change yes I believe it and my sainted
 
02:18:31.009 --> 02:18:31.019 align:start position:0%
wife who is a psychiatrist and was
 
02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
employed at a New Hampshire hospital for
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
11 years saw any number of
 
02:18:40.849 --> 02:18:40.859 align:start position:0%
necessary takedowns of people acting
 
02:18:40.859 --> 02:18:42.650 align:start position:0%
necessary takedowns of people acting
Dangerously

02:18:42.650 --> 02:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
Dangerously
 
02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
but after they were taken down
 
02:18:48.049 --> 02:18:48.059 align:start position:0%
as soon as was feasible they were
 
02:18:50.049 --> 02:18:50.059 align:start position:0%
removed from the prone position
 
02:18:53.650 --> 02:18:53.660 align:start position:0%
to a Supine position or other position
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
wherein a restraint can be more safely
 
02:18:56.639 --> 02:18:59.230 align:start position:0%
wherein a restraint can be more safely
applied

02:18:59.230 --> 02:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:01.730 --> 02:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor I'm glad you stayed for
 
02:19:03.650 --> 02:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
questions if you had written testimony
 
02:19:05.690 --> 02:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
that you were reading would you mind
 
02:19:07.389 --> 02:19:07.399 align:start position:0%
sharing it with the clerk for the record
 
02:19:10.990 --> 02:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chair now recognizes state
 
02:19:15.770 --> 02:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%

02:19:50.929 --> 02:19:50.939 align:start position:0%
this is very critical
 
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
I believe when someone is having
 
02:19:59.210 --> 02:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
a broken moment in a crisis the lesson
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
that they need
 
02:20:04.310 --> 02:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
is feel like I'm safe
 
02:20:07.790 --> 02:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:10.250 --> 02:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
especially when we're dealing with uh
 
02:20:13.130 --> 02:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
kids with autism
 
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:16.920 align:start position:0%

hi thank you my name is Crystal bishop
 
02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm a nursing student at the mass
 
02:21:08.510 --> 02:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
College of Pharmacy and health science I
 
02:21:10.130 --> 02:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
am reaching out to you with regards to
 
02:21:12.349 --> 02:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
the house bill 491 relating to prone
 
02:21:14.690 --> 02:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
Restraint of minors I support the
 
02:21:16.670 --> 02:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
passing of this bill as it states prone
 
02:21:18.889 --> 02:21:18.899 align:start position:0%
restraint should be specified in current
 
02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
Rich rate and seclusion laws ultimately
 
02:21:22.849 --> 02:21:22.859 align:start position:0%
forbidding its use
 
02:21:25.190 --> 02:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
prome restraint is one where a miner is
 
02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
forced face down on the floor and has
 
02:21:28.969 --> 02:21:28.979 align:start position:0%
pressure applied to their body in order
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
to keep them in the prone position the
 
02:21:33.050 --> 02:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
use of prone restraint increases
 
02:21:35.809 --> 02:21:35.819 align:start position:0%
mortality among children due to the risk
 
02:21:37.610 --> 02:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
of altered respiratory and cardiac
 
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
function when forced pressure is applied
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
restraining minors should be a last
 
02:21:45.710 --> 02:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
resort de-escalation and crisis
 
02:21:47.690 --> 02:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
management strategies should take
 
02:21:49.730 --> 02:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
precedence over the act of physically
 
02:21:51.710 --> 02:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
chemically or environmentally
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
restraining a minor not only does it not
 
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
benefit their physical health but it
 
02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
also compromises their mental health by
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
increasing trauma-related care if
 
02:22:04.190 --> 02:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
restraints are necessary for the safety
 
02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
of the minor or someone around them a
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
seated restraint should be utilized as a
 
02:22:11.150 --> 02:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
mother to a seven-year-old boy I have
 
02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
concerns that the use of prone restraint
 
02:22:16.429 --> 02:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
is still an option due to the ambiguous
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
wording of current law with increasing
 
02:22:21.770 --> 02:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
concern over safety issues in schools
 
02:22:23.450 --> 02:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
over the past several years program
 
02:22:25.550 --> 02:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
restraint should not be included in
 
02:22:28.370 --> 02:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
those concerns as as it is within our
 
02:22:30.410 --> 02:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
means to Outlaw its use it is my hope
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
that you will approve this bill to
 
02:22:34.610 --> 02:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
fibrate the use of prone restraints for
 
02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:36.110 align:start position:0%
fibrate the use of prone restraints for
minors

02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
minors
 
02:22:39.469 --> 02:22:39.479 align:start position:0%

um I just am here to provide information
 
02:23:36.730 --> 02:23:36.740 align:start position:0%
to the committee uh since 2019
 
02:23:40.610 --> 02:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
dcyf has sent out a uh notice to our
 
02:23:43.010 --> 02:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
treatment programs uh discouraging the
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
use of prone restraints uh except for in
 
02:23:48.770 --> 02:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
times where you can you need to get
 
02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
control of the person and move them to a
 
02:23:52.910 --> 02:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
safer restraint and also for purposes of
 
02:23:54.650 --> 02:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
safely transporting them I'm sorry I
 
02:23:56.750 --> 02:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
can't really see the people over there
 
02:23:59.870 --> 02:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
um and uh so we just wanted to provide
 
02:24:01.490 --> 02:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
that information
 
02:24:04.849 --> 02:24:04.859 align:start position:0%
um uh to the committee and uh you know
 
02:24:07.309 --> 02:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
obviously the the division does not run
 
02:24:09.650 --> 02:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
schools or treatment programs so this is
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
an annual notification that we make to
 
02:24:14.510 --> 02:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
our treatment programs so if there's any
 
02:24:16.250 --> 02:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
other questions I'll be happy to answer
 
02:24:19.370 --> 02:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
them thank you counselor

um the support that the office of the
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%

before you today so I am one of two
 
02:25:10.130 --> 02:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
assistant child Advocates
 
02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here on behalf of the child
 
02:25:14.690 --> 02:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
advocate for the State of New Hampshire
 
02:25:17.389 --> 02:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
Cassandra Sanchez who had unavoidable
 
02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
conflict with being here today
 
02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:21.110 align:start position:0%
conflict with being here today
um

02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:25.309 --> 02:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
so while we largely support again a
 
02:25:28.250 --> 02:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
testimony that you've already heard one
 
02:25:30.290 --> 02:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
thing that I think is really important
 
02:25:32.929 --> 02:25:32.939 align:start position:0%
to impart from our office's perspective
 
02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
as as we really
 
02:25:35.399 --> 02:25:36.650 align:start position:0%
as as we really
um

02:25:36.650 --> 02:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:39.530 --> 02:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
you know we really are aimed to be a
 
02:25:40.910 --> 02:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
voice of the children in the state of
 
02:25:44.270 --> 02:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is how children actually
 
02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
feel how Children and Youth actually
 
02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:47.630 align:start position:0%
feel how Children and Youth actually
feel

02:25:47.630 --> 02:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
feel
 
02:25:51.050 --> 02:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
um about prone restraint and so I want
 
02:25:53.630 --> 02:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
to provide an anecdote from a youth that
 
02:25:56.750 --> 02:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
our office recently had communication
 
02:25:59.870 --> 02:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
with and this was it was a youth in a
 
02:26:02.090 --> 02:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
more restrictive placement setting and
 
02:26:05.570 --> 02:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
was prepared to be stepped down and when
 
02:26:07.610 --> 02:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
interviewing with different placement
 
02:26:10.570 --> 02:26:10.580 align:start position:0%
providers this youth expressed
 
02:26:13.969 --> 02:26:13.979 align:start position:0%
significant concern about whether or not
 
02:26:16.429 --> 02:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
the providers that they would be
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
interviewing with would use prone
 
02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:19.969 align:start position:0%
interviewing with would use prone
restraint

02:26:19.969 --> 02:26:19.979 align:start position:0%
restraint
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:23.150 align:start position:0%
and so
um

02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:25.790 --> 02:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
you know the the child noted that they
 
02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:27.530 align:start position:0%
you know the the child noted that they
understood

02:26:27.530 --> 02:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
understood
 
02:26:29.570 --> 02:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
um how dangerous this restraint is and
 
02:26:31.849 --> 02:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
had seen nudist articles
 
02:26:33.469 --> 02:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
um where children had died as a result
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
of positional asphyxiation when in prone
 
02:26:39.469 --> 02:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
position so again
 
02:26:42.050 --> 02:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
um you know I hope to impart on you the
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
voice of of children in our community
 
02:26:45.710 --> 02:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
and what and what youth are thinking
 
02:26:48.530 --> 02:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
about and being faced with
 
02:26:50.450 --> 02:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
um you know what we know about children
 
02:26:52.910 --> 02:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
in residential placement is
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
um almost all largely have trauma
 
02:26:58.490 --> 02:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
backgrounds so the idea that
 
02:27:02.150 --> 02:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
um there's a restraint being used that
 
02:27:05.450 --> 02:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
can provide that can create additional
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
trauma is simply unacceptable and I
 
02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
think our children are saying that as
 
02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:10.130 align:start position:0%
think our children are saying that as
well

02:27:10.130 --> 02:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:27:13.070 --> 02:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so much you did great you
 
02:27:15.230 --> 02:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
originally wanted 15 minutes and you
 
02:27:17.929 --> 02:27:17.939 align:start position:0%
boiled it down so you are in my hall of
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
fame wonderful any questions
 
02:27:24.349 --> 02:27:24.359 align:start position:0%

02:27:32.750 --> 02:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
um your your letter you passed out yes
 
02:27:35.210 --> 02:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
it seems to cut off is there more that
 
02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
we should know it says although the
 
02:27:38.389 --> 02:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate firmly believed
 
02:27:40.429 --> 02:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
from restraint so you want to take the
 
02:27:43.070 --> 02:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
first two pages before you hand it out
 
02:27:46.750 --> 02:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
pass it down there's two pages oh
 
02:27:50.510 --> 02:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:27:53.330 --> 02:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
it's a common mistake
 
02:27:57.950 --> 02:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions for either page
 
02:28:00.050 --> 02:28:00.060 align:start position:0%

02:28:10.190 --> 02:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to pronounce that UE as if
 
02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's you omlout
 
02:28:22.730 --> 02:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:24.889 --> 02:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
uh would you hold for one minute some
 
02:28:26.929 --> 02:28:26.939 align:start position:0%
laughs can't be stifled and we want this
 
02:28:30.170 --> 02:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
one to have its full run
 
02:28:35.090 --> 02:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:38.030 --> 02:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
it has page one but no page two and I
 
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
have page two but no one we'll have
 
02:28:46.270 --> 02:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:47.870 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:47.880 align:start position:0%

name is Keith kenning I'm the advocacy
 
02:28:57.230 --> 02:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
director at Waypoint and um we support
 
02:28:57.240 --> 02:28:57.830 align:start position:0%
director at Waypoint and um we support
um

02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
HP 491 uh with uh representative Muse's
 
02:29:03.889 --> 02:29:03.899 align:start position:0%
um Amendment
 
02:29:06.889 --> 02:29:06.899 align:start position:0%
um a representative amuse uh spoke uh
 
02:29:09.889 --> 02:29:09.899 align:start position:0%
sometime with my CEO borja Alvarez de
 
02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
Toledo uh borja could not be here today
 
02:29:14.210 --> 02:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
but he felt like it was so important
 
02:29:17.690 --> 02:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
that he asked me to publicly testify on
 
02:29:20.030 --> 02:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of Waypoint and this is a brief
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
statement we have House Bill 491
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
clarifies the intent of RSA chapter 160
 
02:29:28.429 --> 02:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
126u to ban prone restraint ensure the
 
02:29:30.889 --> 02:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
safety of children clarifying the
 
02:29:32.990 --> 02:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
prohibition of prone respraying is
 
02:29:34.610 --> 02:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
critical not only from a safety
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
perspective but also from a clinical
 
02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:37.969 align:start position:0%
perspective but also from a clinical
perspective

02:29:37.969 --> 02:29:37.979 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:29:40.130 --> 02:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
most kids in residential facilities who
 
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
find themselves subject to prone
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
restraint have trauma histories as a
 
02:29:45.770 --> 02:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
result of trauma children may respond to
 
02:29:48.590 --> 02:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
triggers with uncontrollable fear and or
 
02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:49.969 align:start position:0%
triggers with uncontrollable fear and or
aggression

02:29:49.969 --> 02:29:49.979 align:start position:0%
aggression
 
02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
restraints exacerbate this trauma and
 
02:29:53.570 --> 02:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
impede progress and recovery even the
 
02:29:56.090 --> 02:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
absence of physical injury prohibiting
 
02:29:58.070 --> 02:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
prone restraint requires those caring

Amendment 112 H as ought to pass is
 
02:31:42.910 --> 02:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
02:31:47.570 --> 02:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
buy yes the dynamic duo uh of page one
 
02:31:49.490 --> 02:31:49.500 align:start position:0%

02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I spoke with the sponsor and
 
02:31:58.370 --> 02:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh statement of findings one two and
 
02:31:58.380 --> 02:31:59.990 align:start position:0%
uh statement of findings one two and
three

02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:32:02.450 --> 02:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
um in the original Bill uh doesn't
 
02:32:06.050 --> 02:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
articulate well enough that
 
02:32:08.929 --> 02:32:08.939 align:start position:0%
that prone restraint restraint is
 
02:32:12.170 --> 02:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
prohibited so in the amendment that
 
02:32:14.450 --> 02:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
we're talking about one two and three
 
02:32:17.389 --> 02:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
clarifies that
 
02:32:19.370 --> 02:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
02:32:21.170 --> 02:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
that's one of the changes the other
 
02:32:24.590 --> 02:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
change is uh on line 27 on the original
 
02:32:28.130 --> 02:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
Bill appearance of pain
 
02:32:31.849 --> 02:32:31.859 align:start position:0%
was removed uh for the reason being that
 
02:32:34.610 --> 02:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
a child who knows the system
 
02:32:38.150 --> 02:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
can certainly give an appearance a pain
 
02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:38.809 align:start position:0%
can certainly give an appearance a pain
um

02:32:38.809 --> 02:32:38.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:42.349 --> 02:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
and that's mine did that's that's the uh
 
02:32:42.359 --> 02:32:44.030 align:start position:0%
and that's mine did that's that's the uh
Amendment

02:32:44.030 --> 02:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what changes in the
 
02:32:50.510 --> 02:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
amendment from the original bill
 
02:32:52.370 --> 02:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
in your opinion is it really just a
 
02:32:54.410 --> 02:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
little bit of clarification it is yeah
 
02:32:57.710 --> 02:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
and just one other thing I I if I may uh
 
02:33:02.150 --> 02:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman the the uh what's the the
 
02:33:05.870 --> 02:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor told me that dcyf may have
 
02:33:18.410 --> 02:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:20.990 --> 02:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
no actually the um there was concerns
 
02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:22.130 align:start position:0%
no actually the um there was concerns
because

02:33:22.130 --> 02:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:33:25.130 --> 02:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
um you know we often for transporting a
 
02:33:27.050 --> 02:33:27.060 align:start position:0%
child we will need to restrain them
 
02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
behind their back however that is done
 
02:33:31.490 --> 02:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
in a standing up position not in a prone
 
02:33:32.990 --> 02:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
restraint position I just want to
 
02:33:35.150 --> 02:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
because thank you so much Ross knows
 
02:33:36.410 --> 02:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
much more about these things than I do I
 
02:33:38.750 --> 02:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure because we do we
 
02:33:41.270 --> 02:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
do need you know the ability to restrain
 
02:33:43.370 --> 02:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
a child standing up so but it seems fine
 
02:33:45.469 --> 02:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
now with that I will close the hearing
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 491 and do what I should
 
02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
have done a minute ago and open an exec
 
02:33:52.370 --> 02:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 491 and the chair
 
02:33:54.790 --> 02:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
moves ought to pass with amendments
 
02:33:58.190 --> 02:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
zero one one two H and representative
 
02:34:01.849 --> 02:34:01.859 align:start position:0%
Perez is seconding it now we can do what
 
02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
we were doing yeah
 
02:34:10.910 --> 02:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:13.070 --> 02:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
I would use the phrase slam dunk but
 
02:34:14.210 --> 02:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
that could be misinterpreted
 
02:34:16.550 --> 02:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond I'd just like to
 
02:34:18.950 --> 02:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
say I don't think more discussion is
 
02:34:22.010 --> 02:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
warranted that we had a number of
 
02:34:23.450 --> 02:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
um very
 
02:34:25.870 --> 02:34:25.880 align:start position:0%
um articulate and
 
02:34:29.330 --> 02:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
experts who testified in favor of this
 
02:34:31.929 --> 02:34:31.939 align:start position:0%
bill they explained to us very clearly
 
02:34:35.450 --> 02:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
what the medical repercussions are of
 
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
using this type of restraint and I think
 
02:34:41.630 --> 02:34:41.640 align:start position:0%
if we keep in mind that our jobs here is
 
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
to are to act in the best interests of
 
02:34:46.190 --> 02:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
children that we will vote this ought to
 
02:34:46.200 --> 02:34:47.870 align:start position:0%

02:34:50.650 --> 02:34:50.660 align:start position:0%

02:37:45.650 --> 02:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
it'll just be a quiet pass through
 
02:37:48.530 --> 02:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
uh so I don't know if we just want to
 
02:37:52.130 --> 02:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
get a vote on the floor uh the consent's
 
02:37:54.889 --> 02:37:54.899 align:start position:0%
okay okay I don't want to risk it okay
 
02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
plus I'm going to write a brilliant
 
02:37:59.090 --> 02:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
blurb oh
 
02:38:02.110 --> 02:38:02.120 align:start position:0%
I'll get it in the union later
 
02:38:06.349 --> 02:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
well I hope so I mean it's just put all
 
02:38:08.809 --> 02:38:08.819 align:start position:0%

03:48:33.590 --> 03:48:33.600 align:start position:0%

because I haven't had a chance to okay
 
03:49:07.429 --> 03:49:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:22.610 --> 03:49:22.620 align:start position:0%

um I got my license in 2005. I let it
 
03:49:58.670 --> 03:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
drop in 15 because I was doing other
 
03:50:01.010 --> 03:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
work and this morning I turned in the
 
03:50:04.490 --> 03:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
rest of my papers to get reinstated so I
 
03:50:04.500 --> 03:50:05.710 align:start position:0%
rest of my papers to get reinstated so I

and treating
 
03:50:11.100 --> 03:50:11.809 align:start position:0%
and treating
um

03:50:11.809 --> 03:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:14.150 --> 03:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
several different
 
03:50:16.190 --> 03:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
um well ailments I guess we'll call it
 
03:50:18.410 --> 03:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
I'm also an art therapist more of you
 
03:50:20.990 --> 03:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
know of me in in that
 
03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:22.910 align:start position:0%
know of me in in that
um

03:50:22.910 --> 03:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:26.889 --> 03:50:26.899 align:start position:0%
venue I've worked in private practice
 
03:50:29.870 --> 03:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
impatient Mental Hospitals
 
03:50:32.170 --> 03:50:32.180 align:start position:0%
out placement
 
03:50:34.490 --> 03:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
agencies where we went out into the
 
03:50:37.790 --> 03:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
community to treat children
 
03:50:37.800 --> 03:50:39.010 align:start position:0%
community to treat children
um

03:50:39.010 --> 03:50:39.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:41.150 --> 03:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:50:43.969 --> 03:50:43.979 align:start position:0%
it's a little hard to get a handle on
 
03:50:46.070 --> 03:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
because people are going well what is
 
03:50:48.889 --> 03:50:48.899 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy it sounds nice
 
03:50:52.550 --> 03:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
you're trying to reunite people but
 
03:50:54.650 --> 03:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
apparently it comes
 
03:50:58.729 --> 03:50:58.739 align:start position:0%
out of someone's work it's not a valid
 
03:51:02.330 --> 03:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
therapy it is not paid for by insurances
 
03:51:06.050 --> 03:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
because it is not a valid therapy and it
 
03:51:10.190 --> 03:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
has something to do with abused children
 
03:51:12.050 --> 03:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
who have
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
do not want to see their parent who
 
03:51:18.110 --> 03:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
abused them and the court ordering that
 
03:51:20.929 --> 03:51:20.939 align:start position:0%
they have some kind of therapy with that
 
03:51:23.590 --> 03:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
parent who abused them
 
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
because it is not a sanctioned therapy
 
03:51:29.030 --> 03:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
of course it is not paid for by
 
03:51:32.750 --> 03:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
insurance so whichever parent
 
03:51:35.090 --> 03:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
the court would then order to pay for
 
03:51:37.670 --> 03:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
this therapy it would be out of pocket
 
03:51:42.050 --> 03:51:42.060 align:start position:0%
and at Great expense
 
03:51:42.060 --> 03:51:43.670 align:start position:0%
and at Great expense
um

03:51:43.670 --> 03:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:47.090 --> 03:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
I have um
 
03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
I think the bill needs a little more
 
03:51:54.410 --> 03:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
work and I think the bill needs buy-in
 
03:52:00.729 --> 03:52:00.739 align:start position:0%
from several of the agencies legal dcyf
 
03:52:04.809 --> 03:52:04.819 align:start position:0%
Waypoint that would have expert
 
03:52:08.030 --> 03:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge in in dealing with the courts
 
03:52:09.830 --> 03:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
and dealing with children who have
 
03:52:13.490 --> 03:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
experienced some of these things so
 
03:52:13.500 --> 03:52:14.269 align:start position:0%
experienced some of these things so
um

03:52:14.269 --> 03:52:14.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:18.349 --> 03:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
I have a a brief thing I wanted to read
 
03:52:21.410 --> 03:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
you I know you have received information
 
03:52:23.510 --> 03:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
and testimony
 
03:52:27.950 --> 03:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
so um a former a retired lawyer Paula
 
03:52:27.960 --> 03:52:29.269 align:start position:0%
so um a former a retired lawyer Paula
worm

03:52:29.269 --> 03:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
worm
 
03:52:29.279 --> 03:52:30.530 align:start position:0%
worm
uh

03:52:30.530 --> 03:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:52:32.690 --> 03:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
as a I'm just going to read like two
 
03:52:34.190 --> 03:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
short paragraphs
 
03:52:36.650 --> 03:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
she says as a former family law attorney
 
03:52:38.990 --> 03:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
who concentrated on child abuse and
 
03:52:42.010 --> 03:52:42.020 align:start position:0%
neglect law I became educated about
 
03:52:45.170 --> 03:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
systematic structural problems towards
 
03:52:47.389 --> 03:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
the end of my career impacting the
 
03:52:49.729 --> 03:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of families in the
 
03:52:52.309 --> 03:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
child custody and child abuse and
 
03:52:55.190 --> 03:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases
 
03:52:58.250 --> 03:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
this paper is an outgrowth of months of
 
03:52:59.870 --> 03:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
Hands-On Court
 
03:53:03.290 --> 03:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
house research I concentrated my efforts
 
03:53:05.990 --> 03:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
on the complex case docket and other
 
03:53:08.929 --> 03:53:08.939 align:start position:0%
cases in the Seacoast area
 
03:53:11.809 --> 03:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
and she has a brief paragraph that she
 
03:53:15.410 --> 03:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
says reunification therapy
 
03:53:15.420 --> 03:53:16.490 align:start position:0%
says reunification therapy
um

03:53:16.490 --> 03:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
it's a reunification therapy is not a
 
03:53:21.590 --> 03:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
therapy because it isn't covered by
 
03:53:22.910 --> 03:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
health insurance
 
03:53:25.969 --> 03:53:25.979 align:start position:0%
and it's not a real therapy it is
 
03:53:28.550 --> 03:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
unethical for a psychologist
 
03:53:31.969 --> 03:53:31.979 align:start position:0%
and I would also say psychiatrist or
 
03:53:34.729 --> 03:53:34.739 align:start position:0%
psychotherapist or a social worker to
 
03:53:37.490 --> 03:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
participate in it judges are ordering it
 
03:53:39.290 --> 03:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
to the tune of a hundred thousand
 
03:53:41.150 --> 03:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
dollars or more and demanding that
 
03:53:43.729 --> 03:53:43.739 align:start position:0%
protective parents borrow the funds to
 
03:53:46.130 --> 03:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
pay for it Grandparents of New Hampshire
 
03:53:48.229 --> 03:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
children have taken out second mortgages
 
03:53:51.110 --> 03:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
on homes to pay for it
 
03:53:54.410 --> 03:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
it is one thing to order therapy in a
 
03:53:57.110 --> 03:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
child abuse or neglect case where the
 
03:53:59.929 --> 03:53:59.939 align:start position:0%
judge has founded a complaint and there
 
03:54:02.090 --> 03:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
is a duty under federal law to attempt
 
03:54:06.610 --> 03:54:06.620 align:start position:0%
to reunify parent and child but to order
 
03:54:10.070 --> 03:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy when they have the
 
03:54:12.590 --> 03:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
power to condition
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
child contact on a parent addressing
 
03:54:19.190 --> 03:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
their bad behavior is beyond the pale it
 
03:54:21.229 --> 03:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
is almost exclusively oh all right then
 
03:54:22.849 --> 03:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
it goes on so
 
03:54:25.610 --> 03:54:25.620 align:start position:0%
what what I would request from you today
 
03:54:27.889 --> 03:54:27.899 align:start position:0%
which is maybe a little unusual for
 
03:54:30.830 --> 03:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
someone introducing a bill is that you
 
03:54:34.790 --> 03:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
retain this bill so that I can
 
03:54:37.790 --> 03:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm I'm willing to work on it in
 
03:54:38.750 --> 03:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
the fall
 
03:54:40.969 --> 03:54:40.979 align:start position:0%
people have already approached me about
 
03:54:43.550 --> 03:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
they would like to give their input up
 
03:54:46.610 --> 03:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
to form a better bill that we can Define
 
03:54:49.610 --> 03:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
the terms that we need to Define so that
 
03:54:52.510 --> 03:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
this is a clear Bill and that
 
03:54:55.809 --> 03:54:55.819 align:start position:0%
we can make an airtight case against
 
03:54:58.309 --> 03:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy
 
03:55:01.969 --> 03:55:01.979 align:start position:0%
and and maybe inform the courts about
 
03:55:05.750 --> 03:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
what is appropriate therapy in this case
 
03:55:08.870 --> 03:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
if this they felt bearingly perhaps that
 
03:55:11.030 --> 03:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
this was a tool that was
 
03:55:13.389 --> 03:55:13.399 align:start position:0%
innocuous or helpful
 
03:55:16.010 --> 03:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
perhaps they didn't understand it is not
 
03:55:18.769 --> 03:55:18.779 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take questions or
 
03:55:18.779 --> 03:55:20.389 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take questions or
comments

03:55:20.389 --> 03:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
comments
 
03:55:22.429 --> 03:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
I think you know from our work in Health
 
03:55:25.150 --> 03:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
and Human Services together last term
 
03:55:29.269 --> 03:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
that one of my day jobs is to be
 
03:55:31.849 --> 03:55:31.859 align:start position:0%
part-time CEO of a medical and
 
03:55:34.790 --> 03:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
counseling center and one of the things
 
03:55:38.050 --> 03:55:38.060 align:start position:0%
I ask when I go to hire
 
03:55:40.550 --> 03:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
potential new councilors to join my
 
03:55:43.370 --> 03:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
staff is are you licensed
 
03:55:46.330 --> 03:55:46.340 align:start position:0%
uh are the people who practice
 
03:55:46.340 --> 03:55:47.889 align:start position:0%
uh are the people who practice
reunification

03:55:47.889 --> 03:55:47.899 align:start position:0%
reunification
 
03:55:51.830 --> 03:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
therapy licensed are they required to be
 
03:55:57.349 --> 03:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:00.650 --> 03:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
um her testimony goes on to say that
 
03:56:02.750 --> 03:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
03:56:05.990 --> 03:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
social workers that participate in this
 
03:56:09.070 --> 03:56:09.080 align:start position:0%
which I find a little hard to believe
 
03:56:11.929 --> 03:56:11.939 align:start position:0%
but so I think if we stick with the line
 
03:56:14.990 --> 03:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
that you need a light so a licensed
 
03:56:17.290 --> 03:56:17.300 align:start position:0%
therapist of any kind would not
 
03:56:19.849 --> 03:56:19.859 align:start position:0%
participate in this form of therapy
 
03:56:23.530 --> 03:56:23.540 align:start position:0%
because it's not a real form of therapy
 
03:56:26.450 --> 03:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
and how does one determine what is a
 
03:56:29.150 --> 03:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
real form of therapy that's an excellent
 
03:56:29.160 --> 03:56:31.010 align:start position:0%
real form of therapy that's an excellent
question

03:56:31.010 --> 03:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:56:31.020 --> 03:56:31.670 align:start position:0%
question
um

03:56:31.670 --> 03:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:35.570 --> 03:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
if and I have read I have a stack of
 
03:56:37.849 --> 03:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
papers like this articles about that
 
03:56:39.950 --> 03:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
whatever so
 
03:56:42.110 --> 03:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
it could be based on something called
 
03:56:45.290 --> 03:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
alienation syndrome which apparently is
 
03:56:50.450 --> 03:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
not listed in the DMS yes yeah I worked
 
03:56:52.429 --> 03:56:52.439 align:start position:0%
in DSM and I couldn't find it right yeah
 
03:56:52.439 --> 03:56:53.990 align:start position:0%
in DSM and I couldn't find it right yeah
so

03:56:53.990 --> 03:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:56:56.510 --> 03:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
um if you were to treat a disorder the
 
03:56:59.410 --> 03:56:59.420 align:start position:0%
disorder would be in the diagnostic
 
03:57:01.910 --> 03:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
practical manual manual of disorders
 
03:57:04.490 --> 03:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
right it's our it's our therapy Bible
 
03:57:06.650 --> 03:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
that we can look everything up it
 
03:57:08.030 --> 03:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't go it doesn't give the treatment
 
03:57:12.170 --> 03:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
that's another book but so to be a valid
 
03:57:14.750 --> 03:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
disorder it would have to be in the
 
03:57:17.510 --> 03:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
statistical manual and then to treat
 
03:57:19.250 --> 03:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
that disorder
 
03:57:20.990 --> 03:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
you would have to have a real disorder
 
03:57:23.450 --> 03:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
you can't make one off and then make up
 
03:57:25.729 --> 03:57:25.739 align:start position:0%
your own therapy
 
03:57:27.950 --> 03:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up question there are all kinds
 
03:57:29.689 --> 03:57:29.699 align:start position:0%
of stuff out there
 
03:57:32.150 --> 03:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
um somebody comes up with something and
 
03:57:34.490 --> 03:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
sells it on TV
 
03:57:34.500 --> 03:57:35.150 align:start position:0%
sells it on TV
um

03:57:35.150 --> 03:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:39.370 --> 03:57:39.380 align:start position:0%
is this reunification therapy
 
03:57:42.670 --> 03:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
acknowledged by any of the professional
 
03:57:47.510 --> 03:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
associations uh of Psychiatry or
 
03:57:49.670 --> 03:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
psychology nationally
 
03:57:52.189 --> 03:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
as a valid therapy as a valid therapist
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
I believe not okay
 
03:57:59.570 --> 03:57:59.580 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions for the Prime
 
03:57:59.580 --> 03:58:02.689 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions for the Prime
sponsor

03:58:02.689 --> 03:58:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:05.570 --> 03:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
I don't see any and you your testimony
 
03:58:07.969 --> 03:58:07.979 align:start position:0%
included the statement that there were
 
03:58:09.950 --> 03:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
people who would like to work with you
 
03:58:12.410 --> 03:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
they don't have to wait until the fall
 
03:58:15.050 --> 03:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
um any citizen can work with you further
 
03:58:16.910 --> 03:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
if you wish
 
03:58:19.670 --> 03:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that so it is your hope
 
03:58:22.130 --> 03:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
that this committee would retain the
 
03:58:26.389 --> 03:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
bill for further work right because it
 
03:58:29.210 --> 03:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
um with the support of this committee to
 
03:58:31.010 --> 03:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
name a time in a place where we could
 
03:58:31.020 --> 03:58:32.450 align:start position:0%
name a time in a place where we could
meet

03:58:32.450 --> 03:58:32.460 align:start position:0%
meet
 
03:58:37.309 --> 03:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
um and notice that we were meeting we
 
03:58:39.889 --> 03:58:39.899 align:start position:0%
may get some shareholders in that we
 
03:58:42.110 --> 03:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
might I might not otherwise know how to
 
03:58:45.050 --> 03:58:45.060 align:start position:0%
contact my the what you you will recall
 
03:58:46.670 --> 03:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
the way I worked at Health and Human
 
03:58:49.010 --> 03:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
Services committee was any group of
 
03:58:51.469 --> 03:58:51.479 align:start position:0%
people with a couple of reps you know
 
03:58:53.630 --> 03:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
we're not going to violate 91a we're not
 
03:58:55.130 --> 03:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
going to have 51 percent of the
 
03:58:57.050 --> 03:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
committee but we could grab a couple of
 
03:58:58.670 --> 03:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
reps and then anybody from the
 
03:59:00.889 --> 03:59:00.899 align:start position:0%
Department from this Association that
 
03:59:03.170 --> 03:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
whatever and spend a lot of time hanging
 
03:59:06.290 --> 03:59:06.300 align:start position:0%
out doing things so that when we come to
 
03:59:08.150 --> 03:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
the fall and take a retained bill off
 
03:59:10.910 --> 03:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
the table and look at it again a lot of
 
03:59:14.210 --> 03:59:14.220 align:start position:0%
work has been done prior to that I am
 
03:59:16.610 --> 03:59:16.620 align:start position:0%
more than willing to facilitate what
 
03:59:18.650 --> 03:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
worked as you recall we didn't do work
 
03:59:20.389 --> 03:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
groups in the traditional way we did
 
03:59:22.250 --> 03:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
them a different way and I think it had
 
03:59:25.610 --> 03:59:25.620 align:start position:0%
some success I believe so okay thank you
 
03:59:27.290 --> 03:59:27.300 align:start position:0%
see no
 
03:59:30.950 --> 03:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
further except for one except for one
 
03:59:33.530 --> 03:59:33.540 align:start position:0%

03:59:35.030 --> 03:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
03:59:37.610 --> 03:59:37.620 align:start position:0%
just a point of clarification for me
 
03:59:39.290 --> 03:59:39.300 align:start position:0%
because I'm taking the notes
 
03:59:41.090 --> 03:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
um the alienation syndrome did you said
 
03:59:43.969 --> 03:59:43.979 align:start position:0%
that is not in the DSM it is not okay
 
03:59:45.290 --> 03:59:45.300 align:start position:0%
that's I just wanted to make sure I had
 
03:59:47.110 --> 03:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
that correct thank you thank you
 
03:59:47.120 --> 03:59:48.889 align:start position:0%
that correct thank you thank you

03:59:48.889 --> 03:59:48.899 align:start position:0%

representative
Moulton

03:59:50.330 --> 03:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
Moulton
 
03:59:52.429 --> 03:59:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:59:56.689 --> 03:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
um so is reunification therapy being
 
03:59:59.570 --> 03:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
ordered in the state of New Hampshire it
 
04:00:01.429 --> 04:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
is so what do they do is it's just
 
04:00:01.439 --> 04:00:03.110 align:start position:0%
is so what do they do is it's just
psychotherapy

04:00:03.110 --> 04:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
psychotherapy
 
04:00:05.330 --> 04:00:05.340 align:start position:0%
Well it can't be Psychotherapy because
 
04:00:07.969 --> 04:00:07.979 align:start position:0%
it would be illegal they have to be
 
04:00:09.950 --> 04:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
doing something if it's ordered so what
 
04:00:13.130 --> 04:00:13.140 align:start position:0%
are they doing for therapy
 
04:00:15.410 --> 04:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
um it's non-licensed people who are
 
04:00:17.689 --> 04:00:17.699 align:start position:0%
doing and I'd like more information
 
04:00:21.050 --> 04:00:21.060 align:start position:0%
about what exactly so it's it can't be a
 
04:00:22.490 --> 04:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
licensed person because it wouldn't be
 
04:00:24.110 --> 04:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
covered by insurance and it wouldn't be
 
04:00:27.170 --> 04:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
ethical for their discipline
 
04:00:30.530 --> 04:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
to engage in therapy that is not a valid
 
04:00:33.290 --> 04:00:33.300 align:start position:0%
therapy so it would have to be
 
04:00:35.750 --> 04:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
somebody who says I do reunification
 
04:00:37.550 --> 04:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
therapy without
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know what kind of training
 
04:00:41.870 --> 04:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
okay so you're not sure how they're
 
04:00:43.910 --> 04:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
currently treating it but we but we know
 
04:00:46.309 --> 04:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
that it's being ordered yes okay thank
 
04:00:50.750 --> 04:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative DeSimone
 
04:00:52.429 --> 04:00:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:00:57.769 --> 04:00:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:01.189 --> 04:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
to take the word reunification out
 
04:01:03.050 --> 04:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
and just
 
04:01:03.060 --> 04:01:04.010 align:start position:0%
and just
um

04:01:04.010 --> 04:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:07.189 --> 04:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
state that the family needed to enter
 
04:01:10.610 --> 04:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
into therapy
 
04:01:13.849 --> 04:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
could it be during that therapeutic time
 
04:01:18.650 --> 04:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
that the therapist would gear couldn't
 
04:01:21.170 --> 04:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
it be true that the therapist would gear
 
04:01:21.180 --> 04:01:22.389 align:start position:0%
it be true that the therapist would gear
toward

04:01:22.389 --> 04:01:22.399 align:start position:0%
toward
 
04:01:25.610 --> 04:01:25.620 align:start position:0%
reunifying the family unit
 
04:01:29.150 --> 04:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
without using the reunification
 
04:01:31.130 --> 04:01:31.140 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:01:33.530 --> 04:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
I think it's appropriate sometimes for
 
04:01:38.030 --> 04:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
courts to say I think we need a therapy
 
04:01:41.030 --> 04:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
to see what we can do with this family I
 
04:01:42.650 --> 04:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
would just be comfortable that it's a
 
04:01:45.469 --> 04:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
licensed therapist therapist who's
 
04:01:47.330 --> 04:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
working to
 
04:01:50.269 --> 04:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
I wish I could find an uh to put the
 
04:01:52.070 --> 04:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
family back together if that's possible
 
04:01:55.370 --> 04:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
but the reunification therapy is always
 
04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
with a case of abuse
 
04:02:00.889 --> 04:02:00.899 align:start position:0%
and like how far do you push a child to
 
04:02:02.450 --> 04:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
have to be in the presence of someone
 
04:02:05.809 --> 04:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
who abused them I mean I quit a job a
 
04:02:08.150 --> 04:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
few years ago over a salary dispute and
 
04:02:10.849 --> 04:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
I never want to see my manager again
 
04:02:13.670 --> 04:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm you know and that's trivial
 
04:02:15.650 --> 04:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
compared to what some of these children
 
04:02:18.889 --> 04:02:18.899 align:start position:0%
would have been through and so
 
04:02:18.899 --> 04:02:20.150 align:start position:0%
would have been through and so
um

04:02:20.150 --> 04:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:20.160 --> 04:02:21.950 align:start position:0%
um
I

04:02:21.950 --> 04:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:02:25.070 --> 04:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of pollyanna-ish I'd like to
 
04:02:27.290 --> 04:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
think that professional licensed
 
04:02:30.290 --> 04:02:30.300 align:start position:0%
therapists would do whatever is in the
 
04:02:32.870 --> 04:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child
 
04:02:37.070 --> 04:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
and not to have the court order we want
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
type a therapy
 
04:02:41.929 --> 04:02:41.939 align:start position:0%
just the the blanket
 
04:02:45.229 --> 04:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
this family needs therapy that's
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate but to pick which kind and
 
04:02:51.170 --> 04:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
who they need to go to and how to pay
 
04:02:54.769 --> 04:02:54.779 align:start position:0%
out of pocket is not appropriate as we
 
04:02:57.950 --> 04:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
did past House Bill 200
 
04:03:01.610 --> 04:03:01.620 align:start position:0%
about Judges ordering therapy has to be
 
04:03:04.910 --> 04:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
within a parent's insurance plan and and
 
04:03:07.070 --> 04:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
that's fair so
 
04:03:09.229 --> 04:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
yeah we're not ready to put microphones
 
04:03:11.330 --> 04:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
inside of the therapy offices to know
 
04:03:13.370 --> 04:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
exactly the nuances of everything that
 
04:03:15.710 --> 04:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
goes on but I like to trust in my
 
04:03:17.349 --> 04:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
profession that
 
04:03:21.050 --> 04:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
qualified licensed therapists are are
 
04:03:23.870 --> 04:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
doing a good job I'd like to also think
 
04:03:27.410 --> 04:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
that judges are honest in doing their
 
04:03:30.050 --> 04:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
best job but maybe in this case maybe a
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
little misinformed about what's going on
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:41.090 --> 04:03:41.100 align:start position:0%

expert folks after me I believe but
 
04:04:34.670 --> 04:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
um we support the idea of retaining the
 
04:04:37.849 --> 04:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
bill and and working on another
 
04:04:40.729 --> 04:04:40.739 align:start position:0%
um some additional revisions or language
 
04:04:40.739 --> 04:04:43.250 align:start position:0%
um some additional revisions or language
we

04:04:43.250 --> 04:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:04:45.050 --> 04:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
do not
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
um support reunification therapy uh we
 
04:04:51.229 --> 04:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
think though that this bill also would
 
04:04:53.929 --> 04:04:53.939 align:start position:0%
not prevent the use of unification
 
04:04:55.849 --> 04:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
therapy as currently drafted so we're
 
04:04:58.130 --> 04:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
interested in working on with the
 
04:04:59.630 --> 04:04:59.640 align:start position:0%

04:05:01.790 --> 04:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
um Drafting and clarifying some of the
 
04:05:04.370 --> 04:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
language uh and getting buy-in from the
 
04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
courts Etc to make sure that it can be
 
04:05:06.000 --> 04:05:07.010 align:start position:0%
courts Etc to make sure that it can be
implemented

04:05:07.010 --> 04:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
04:05:12.189 --> 04:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:16.670 --> 04:05:16.680 align:start position:0%

04:05:50.630 --> 04:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
this doesn't count against Japan okay
 
04:05:52.370 --> 04:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
04:05:55.250 --> 04:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
my name is Bill Woodbury and I'm a an
 
04:05:56.710 --> 04:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
attorney practicing in Laconia
 
04:06:00.110 --> 04:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
practicing primarily family law and
 
04:06:02.689 --> 04:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
although I do do other things
 
04:06:06.170 --> 04:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
and I am the uh I'm a past president and
 
04:06:07.550 --> 04:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
current legislative chair for New
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association for justice and uh
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
we're here in um in opposition to this
 
04:06:13.439 --> 04:06:14.290 align:start position:0%
we're here in um in opposition to this
bill

04:06:14.290 --> 04:06:14.300 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:06:19.309 --> 04:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
we believe that where it is our job to
 
04:06:20.870 --> 04:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
kind of look out for things that deny
 
04:06:23.330 --> 04:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
access to justice that this is an issue
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
of that of that nature in that it is
 
04:06:28.070 --> 04:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
taking away an important tool in the
 
04:06:29.830 --> 04:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
judicial toolbox
 
04:06:33.229 --> 04:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that I mean in the 19
 
04:06:34.790 --> 04:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
years that I've been doing family law I
 
04:06:38.030 --> 04:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
have not seen the reunification Theory
 
04:06:40.969 --> 04:06:40.979 align:start position:0%
as presented occurring
 
04:06:42.650 --> 04:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not saying it isn't I practice
 
04:06:45.229 --> 04:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
in a specific part of the state but I
 
04:06:47.330 --> 04:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
think that um what the what the prime
 
04:06:48.830 --> 04:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor said is absolutely true that
 
04:06:51.110 --> 04:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a more specific
 
04:06:53.990 --> 04:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
definition of what is being discussed
 
04:06:55.849 --> 04:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
here I think it was representative de
 
04:06:57.530 --> 04:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
Simone that kind of hit upon the fact
 
04:07:00.170 --> 04:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
that there's any number of things that
 
04:07:01.670 --> 04:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
could be ordered by the court that could
 
04:07:04.550 --> 04:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
fall into the the the
 
04:07:07.610 --> 04:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
umbrella of reunification therapy
 
04:07:10.309 --> 04:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
um is any number of situations a vast
 
04:07:11.809 --> 04:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
number of situations and different types
 
04:07:13.490 --> 04:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
of cases abuse neglect divorce
 
04:07:18.050 --> 04:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
post-divorce where um you know uh the
 
04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
court could see it as uh in the best
 
04:07:22.309 --> 04:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
interest of the child as is their
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
mandate they there it is under um 461a
 
04:07:28.910 --> 04:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
is the policy of the state to ensure
 
04:07:31.250 --> 04:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
that both parents have
 
04:07:33.469 --> 04:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
um a relationship in contact with the
 
04:07:34.849 --> 04:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
with the child as long as it's in that
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
child's best interest
 
04:07:39.650 --> 04:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
so I think that in the absence of a firm
 
04:07:40.849 --> 04:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
definition of what constitutes
 
04:07:44.630 --> 04:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy uh that and the
 
04:07:45.830 --> 04:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
04:07:47.809 --> 04:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
um as to the to the other parts of this
 
04:07:47.819 --> 04:07:49.370 align:start position:0%
um as to the to the other parts of this
that

04:07:49.370 --> 04:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:07:53.450 --> 04:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
um the judges I think always try to make
 
04:07:55.849 --> 04:07:55.859 align:start position:0%
sure that there's ability to pay
 
04:07:55.859 --> 04:07:57.550 align:start position:0%
sure that there's ability to pay
insurance

04:07:57.550 --> 04:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:07:59.870 --> 04:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
agreement between the parties as to who
 
04:08:01.969 --> 04:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
is going to be approached for therapy in
 
04:08:04.130 --> 04:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
my experience the judges go a long way
 
04:08:05.210 --> 04:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
to try and make sure that they're not
 
04:08:06.110 --> 04:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
going to order something that's
 
04:08:06.120 --> 04:08:07.610 align:start position:0%
going to order something that's
impossible

04:08:07.610 --> 04:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
um you know that would be against their
 
04:08:09.769 --> 04:08:09.779 align:start position:0%
mandate as well they're not going to
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
order something that somebody simply
 
04:08:14.510 --> 04:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
can't do financially or otherwise so I
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
think this bill uh it it it's kind of
 
04:08:19.610 --> 04:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
asking for something that's exceedingly
 
04:08:22.189 --> 04:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
vague right now and that we do we oppose
 
04:08:25.269 --> 04:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
it I'm happy to answer any questions
 
04:08:27.290 --> 04:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
04:08:29.389 --> 04:08:29.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:08:31.490 --> 04:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
taking my call I wonder if you could
 
04:08:33.590 --> 04:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
please provide a couple of you know
 
04:08:37.490 --> 04:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
General examples of
 
04:08:39.710 --> 04:08:39.720 align:start position:0%
um situations family situations where
 
04:08:42.710 --> 04:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy would be have been
 
04:08:42.720 --> 04:08:44.570 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy would be have been
administered

04:08:44.570 --> 04:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
administered
 
04:08:46.610 --> 04:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
well again not knowing the exact
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
definition that that the prime sponsor
 
04:08:50.150 --> 04:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
described or that you know if something
 
04:08:51.650 --> 04:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
costing hundreds of thousands of dollars
 
04:08:55.250 --> 04:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
or anything like that but the need to
 
04:08:57.710 --> 04:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
have therapy to promote reunification
 
04:09:00.410 --> 04:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
could happen after a period of of a
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
parent being in prison uh could happen
 
04:09:04.910 --> 04:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
after a period of a parent being in
 
04:09:06.769 --> 04:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
rehab for substance abuse it could have
 
04:09:08.689 --> 04:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
no absolutely nothing to do with abuse
 
04:09:11.330 --> 04:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
or anything like that it could happen
 
04:09:14.809 --> 04:09:14.819 align:start position:0%
after there was a finding of abuse
 
04:09:17.689 --> 04:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
um and you know uh with with therapy
 
04:09:19.790 --> 04:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
that parent proves to the court that
 
04:09:21.650 --> 04:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
they they have the ability to go forward
 
04:09:24.050 --> 04:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
with a relationship with a child that is
 
04:09:31.490 --> 04:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:33.229 --> 04:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:09:33.239 --> 04:09:33.849 align:start position:0%
all right
um

04:09:33.849 --> 04:09:33.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:36.530 --> 04:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
there are any number of situations you
 
04:09:37.910 --> 04:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
know that you could imagine with as an
 
04:09:39.290 --> 04:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
interruption in that relationship
 
04:09:40.910 --> 04:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
between a parent and child for whatever
 
04:09:43.969 --> 04:09:43.979 align:start position:0%
reason and the Court's always going to
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
going to be asking the question the
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
first instance is it in the best
 
04:09:48.769 --> 04:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
interest of the child to reunify with
 
04:09:50.450 --> 04:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
this parent
 
04:09:52.910 --> 04:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
um and if it is not they'll they'll be
 
04:09:55.309 --> 04:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
you know an alternative solution
 
04:09:58.130 --> 04:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
suggested but therapy is a crucial Tool
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh and again many things would fall
 
04:10:03.170 --> 04:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
under that umbrella of reunification
 
04:10:03.180 --> 04:10:06.530 align:start position:0%
under that umbrella of reunification
therapy

04:10:06.530 --> 04:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:09.769 --> 04:10:09.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:11.090 --> 04:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you thank you for

intention of testifying
 
04:11:24.229 --> 04:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to provide a little bit of
 
04:11:27.050 --> 04:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
context regarding what is referred to as
 
04:11:29.689 --> 04:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy I think what the
 
04:11:31.910 --> 04:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor was trying to say at the
 
04:11:33.469 --> 04:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
beginning and not to put words in her
 
04:11:35.450 --> 04:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
mouth this is not an evidence-based
 
04:11:35.460 --> 04:11:36.910 align:start position:0%
mouth this is not an evidence-based
practice

04:11:36.910 --> 04:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
practice
 
04:11:38.990 --> 04:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice is the gold
 
04:11:41.389 --> 04:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
standard of any kind of therapeutic
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
intervention what re what a therapy what
 
04:11:47.150 --> 04:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
an evidence-based practice is requires
 
04:11:48.769 --> 04:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
is research
 
04:11:51.710 --> 04:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
that confirms the efficacy
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
and the outcomes of any intervention
 
04:11:58.429 --> 04:11:58.439 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy broadly is not an
 
04:12:01.030 --> 04:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
accepted intervention by any national
 
04:12:03.349 --> 04:12:03.359 align:start position:0%

organization

04:12:05.210 --> 04:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
organization
 
04:12:08.210 --> 04:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
it has in fact been researched since the
 
04:12:10.729 --> 04:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
mid 80s was originally referred to as
 
04:12:13.070 --> 04:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
parental alienation syndrome
 
04:12:15.710 --> 04:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
it is now simply recall referred to as
 
04:12:18.410 --> 04:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
parental alienation it is not a syndrome
 
04:12:18.420 --> 04:12:19.910 align:start position:0%
parental alienation it is not a syndrome
officially

04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
officially
 
04:12:23.450 --> 04:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
it is also not in the DSM-5 which is the
 
04:12:25.389 --> 04:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
diagnostic and statistical manual for
 
04:12:29.330 --> 04:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
mental illness that is used by most um
 
04:12:29.340 --> 04:12:32.030 align:start position:0%
mental illness that is used by most um
psychotherapists

04:12:32.030 --> 04:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
psychotherapists
 
04:12:36.889 --> 04:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:36.899 --> 04:12:38.269 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:12:38.269 --> 04:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:12:40.250 --> 04:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
when it's been ordered it's been ordered
 
04:12:44.389 --> 04:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
relative to divorce disputes where one
 
04:12:48.050 --> 04:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
parent has accused another parent of
 
04:12:52.309 --> 04:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
saying bad things my word and alienating
 
04:12:55.130 --> 04:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
that child from the parent
 
04:12:57.530 --> 04:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
our the position of both of my clients
 
04:12:59.450 --> 04:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
very simply is that there is no such
 
04:13:02.090 --> 04:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
thing as reunification therapy
 
04:13:02.100 --> 04:13:03.349 align:start position:0%
thing as reunification therapy
um

04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:06.170 --> 04:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
and with due respect to the court we
 
04:13:08.630 --> 04:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
respect the Court's need for assessments
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
and therapeutic intervention and think
 
04:13:12.590 --> 04:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate in any instance that
 
04:13:14.150 --> 04:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
the judge believes it's appropriate
 
04:13:14.160 --> 04:13:16.070 align:start position:0%
the judge believes it's appropriate
however

04:13:16.070 --> 04:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
my clients do not believe a judge should
 
04:13:20.990 --> 04:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
be ordering reunification therapy
 
04:13:24.849 --> 04:13:24.859 align:start position:0%
any more than they should order CBT DBT
 
04:13:26.750 --> 04:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
psychoanalysis or any other
 
04:13:29.570 --> 04:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice if a judge has a
 
04:13:31.130 --> 04:13:31.140 align:start position:0%
need for an assessment that is an
 
04:13:33.110 --> 04:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate order
 
04:13:36.349 --> 04:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
and they may even order the therapist to
 
04:13:38.090 --> 04:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
assess the ability of the family to
 
04:13:38.100 --> 04:13:39.590 align:start position:0%
assess the ability of the family to
reunify

04:13:39.590 --> 04:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
reunify
 
04:13:41.450 --> 04:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate
 
04:13:43.309 --> 04:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
it's also appropriate to provide
 
04:13:45.110 --> 04:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic intervention
 
04:13:47.929 --> 04:13:47.939 align:start position:0%
in that case though licensed therapists
 
04:13:51.110 --> 04:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
in all instances take their lead from
 
04:13:53.510 --> 04:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
what the clients whether that's an
 
04:13:55.490 --> 04:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
individual or family what the clients
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
seek to achieve
 
04:14:00.469 --> 04:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
if a client seeks to reunify their
 
04:14:00.479 --> 04:14:01.790 align:start position:0%
if a client seeks to reunify their
family

04:14:01.790 --> 04:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
that can be an appropriate therapeutic
 
04:14:05.040 --> 04:14:06.349 align:start position:0%
that can be an appropriate therapeutic
approach

04:14:06.349 --> 04:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
approach
 
04:14:08.990 --> 04:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
if everyone in the family is in
 
04:14:09.000 --> 04:14:10.610 align:start position:0%
if everyone in the family is in
agreement

04:14:10.610 --> 04:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
04:14:13.790 --> 04:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll leave it at that but
 
04:14:15.729 --> 04:14:15.739 align:start position:0%
we just simply wanted to provide context
 
04:14:19.250 --> 04:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
that this is not a recognized practice
 
04:14:20.990 --> 04:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
nor is an Evidence evidence-based
 
04:14:24.229 --> 04:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
practice and we would strongly request
 
04:14:27.170 --> 04:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
with all due respect of the court to
 
04:14:29.870 --> 04:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
order an assessment or therapy as
 
04:14:31.849 --> 04:14:31.859 align:start position:0%
opposed to identify the intervention and
 
04:14:33.650 --> 04:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
permit the licensed therapist to
 
04:14:35.450 --> 04:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
determine which is the most appropriate
 
04:14:37.370 --> 04:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
intervention given the needs of that
 
04:14:37.380 --> 04:14:39.710 align:start position:0%
intervention given the needs of that
family

04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.410 --> 04:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh sir you mentioned
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
that uh something was studied in the 80s
 
04:14:49.370 --> 04:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
you use the term parental alienation was
 
04:14:51.650 --> 04:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy itself ever
 
04:14:55.729 --> 04:14:55.739 align:start position:0%
studied by outside groups looking at it
 
04:14:58.189 --> 04:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
it has been studied intermittently in
 
04:15:01.130 --> 04:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
the literature when I reference parental
 
04:15:04.729 --> 04:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
alienation syndrome that was the and I
 
04:15:06.590 --> 04:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
don't have I apologize I do not have the
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
researcher's name
 
04:15:11.090 --> 04:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy was a direct
 
04:15:13.490 --> 04:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
outgrowth of Parental alienation
 
04:15:17.330 --> 04:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
syndrome and this researcher theorized
 
04:15:20.990 --> 04:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
that therapy to reunify the family was a
 
04:15:22.550 --> 04:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
way to address parental alienation
 
04:15:22.560 --> 04:15:23.870 align:start position:0%
way to address parental alienation
syndrome

04:15:23.870 --> 04:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
syndrome
 
04:15:26.870 --> 04:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
since 1980 however many decades that is
 
04:15:30.410 --> 04:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
my math is not is failing me today since
 
04:15:32.389 --> 04:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
that there have been intermittent
 
04:15:34.969 --> 04:15:34.979 align:start position:0%
efforts but most of the literature
 
04:15:37.309 --> 04:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
suggests it talks about what I spoke
 
04:15:40.490 --> 04:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
about today that reunification therapy
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
is not a recognized therapy nor is it
 
04:15:44.990 --> 04:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
evidence-based some researchers refer to
 
04:15:47.630 --> 04:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
it as pseudoscience others simply say it
 
04:15:50.330 --> 04:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
is not it doesn't have a body of
 
04:15:52.429 --> 04:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
knowledge that recognizes the efficacy
 
04:15:56.090 --> 04:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
or the positive outcomes of the of any
 
04:15:59.090 --> 04:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
in intervention of that sort thank you
 
04:16:01.849 --> 04:16:01.859 align:start position:0%
any further questions from Mr dejoy uh
 
04:16:03.830 --> 04:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
04:16:06.110 --> 04:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thank you um Mr dejoy
 
04:16:07.969 --> 04:16:07.979 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:16:11.030 --> 04:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
um you had said that your clients um
 
04:16:13.370 --> 04:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
which are a psychological Association
 
04:16:15.070 --> 04:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
nationally and the New Hampshire chapter
 
04:16:18.050 --> 04:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
and then the Association of Social
 
04:16:19.670 --> 04:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
Workers nationally and the New Hampshire
 
04:16:23.630 --> 04:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
chapter would ask judges to order an
 
04:16:27.590 --> 04:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
assessment and therapy if appropriate
 
04:16:31.130 --> 04:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
um would you want would your clients
 
04:16:33.650 --> 04:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
also want that to say like buy a
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
licensed mental health counselor
 
04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
or mental health counselor licensed by
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire or something
 
04:16:41.870 --> 04:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
there to indicate that it is in fact
 
04:16:44.030 --> 04:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
someone who has been licensed and is
 
04:16:46.550 --> 04:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
overseen as opposed to just any person
 
04:16:48.889 --> 04:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
calling themselves a counselor
 
04:16:50.210 --> 04:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question
 
04:16:52.670 --> 04:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative and just for clarity I
 
04:16:54.290 --> 04:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire chapters of
 
04:16:56.269 --> 04:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
both organizations okay there is a
 
04:16:58.010 --> 04:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
National Organization as well that I do
 
04:16:59.450 --> 04:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
not represent okay thank you for
 
04:17:01.150 --> 04:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
clarifying so
 
04:17:05.450 --> 04:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
I have not had that conversation with my
 
04:17:09.050 --> 04:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
client uh directly
 
04:17:11.510 --> 04:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm losing my train of thought
 
04:17:13.250 --> 04:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
can you repeat the question just that's
 
04:17:16.189 --> 04:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
okay my question was instead of ordering
 
04:17:18.229 --> 04:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
a particular type of counseling or
 
04:17:18.239 --> 04:17:19.610 align:start position:0%
a particular type of counseling or
therapy

04:17:19.610 --> 04:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
04:17:24.349 --> 04:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
would your associations want judges to
 
04:17:26.990 --> 04:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
or even have a law that said judges are
 
04:17:28.729 --> 04:17:28.739 align:start position:0%
are to order
 
04:17:31.729 --> 04:17:31.739 align:start position:0%
um you know assessment and appropriate
 
04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
therapy by a licensed you know counselor
 
04:17:37.070 --> 04:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
or mental health therapist that's a
 
04:17:40.070 --> 04:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
great question we we believe that um
 
04:17:41.870 --> 04:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
we believe that interventions of that
 
04:17:41.880 --> 04:17:42.950 align:start position:0%
we believe that interventions of that
level

04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:17:44.450 --> 04:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
ought to be licensed but we have a
 
04:17:47.469 --> 04:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
license licensing scheme in this state
 
04:17:50.929 --> 04:17:50.939 align:start position:0%
that requires social workers identifying
 
04:17:52.490 --> 04:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
themselves in certain ways to be
 
04:17:54.170 --> 04:17:54.180 align:start position:0%
licensed as well as psychologists to be
 
04:17:54.180 --> 04:17:55.189 align:start position:0%
licensed as well as psychologists to be
licensed

04:17:55.189 --> 04:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'll leave that to to you folks in Edna
 
04:17:59.040 --> 04:18:00.170 align:start position:0%
I'll leave that to to you folks in Edna
um

04:18:00.170 --> 04:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:02.689 --> 04:18:02.699 align:start position:0%
I would hope that the court and I
 
04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
believe the courts are using due
 
04:18:08.150 --> 04:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
diligence as the if they assign someone
 
04:18:10.070 --> 04:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
to assess and that they are using
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
licensed therapists I don't know that
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
but that would be my expectation
 
04:18:17.630 --> 04:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
thank you

testimony from Judge Jennifer Lemire who
 
04:19:58.670 --> 04:19:58.680 align:start position:0%

um I can give I can hand out
 
04:20:09.650 --> 04:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
um in what is contained in judgments
 
04:20:12.290 --> 04:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
um testimony is is sort of in very
 
04:20:14.630 --> 04:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
general terms what it is and how she
 
04:20:14.640 --> 04:20:16.309 align:start position:0%
general terms what it is and how she
uses

04:20:16.309 --> 04:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
uses
 
04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
um counseling which uh is broadly
 
04:20:22.490 --> 04:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
described as reunification counseling
 
04:20:22.500 --> 04:20:23.330 align:start position:0%
described as reunification counseling
um

04:20:23.330 --> 04:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:25.130 --> 04:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we do support
 
04:20:27.410 --> 04:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
having this bill retained we think as
 
04:20:29.630 --> 04:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
written it is very Broad and could
 
04:20:32.570 --> 04:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
Encompass a great deal more than perhaps
 
04:20:36.229 --> 04:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
even one than what was intended uh in
 
04:20:39.229 --> 04:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
terms of the of the scope of it
 
04:20:41.929 --> 04:20:41.939 align:start position:0%
um and and in general you know as the
 
04:20:44.210 --> 04:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
the sponsor had identified uh
 
04:20:46.729 --> 04:20:46.739 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy is being used in
 
04:20:49.429 --> 04:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
abusive abuse and neglect situations and
 
04:20:53.210 --> 04:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
the reality is it is uh considered in a
 
04:20:55.969 --> 04:20:55.979 align:start position:0%
much broader Circle set of circumstances
 
04:20:55.979 --> 04:20:57.889 align:start position:0%
much broader Circle set of circumstances
where

04:20:57.889 --> 04:20:57.899 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:20:59.689 --> 04:20:59.699 align:start position:0%
um there's been a long period of
 
04:21:01.610 --> 04:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
separation between a parent and a child
 
04:21:05.090 --> 04:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh whether it be by imprisonment by some
 
04:21:07.010 --> 04:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
mental health issues that have have
 
04:21:09.950 --> 04:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
caused a parent not to participate uh
 
04:21:13.490 --> 04:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
with a child whether it be
 
04:21:13.500 --> 04:21:14.330 align:start position:0%
with a child whether it be
um

04:21:14.330 --> 04:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:17.090 --> 04:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
a whole host of potential reasons why
 
04:21:18.889 --> 04:21:18.899 align:start position:0%
there's been a period of separation
 
04:21:21.769 --> 04:21:21.779 align:start position:0%
between a parent and a child and and
 
04:21:24.410 --> 04:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
that child may very well have no memory
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
of that parent or have no impression of
 
04:21:29.570 --> 04:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
that parent and have no interest in
 
04:21:31.670 --> 04:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
having that parent participate in their
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
in their lives and the reality is though
 
04:21:36.469 --> 04:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
as as a judge they have constitutional
 
04:21:39.290 --> 04:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
and statutory obligations relative to
 
04:21:42.050 --> 04:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
both parents having a role in that child
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
in that child's life
 
04:21:46.610 --> 04:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
and as as judge Lemire explains in her
 
04:21:48.410 --> 04:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
04:21:52.010 --> 04:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
during the course of of a proceeding she
 
04:21:54.469 --> 04:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
may not have or a judge may not have
 
04:21:57.050 --> 04:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
sufficient information to know what is
 
04:21:59.389 --> 04:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
the cause of the child's resistance to a
 
04:22:01.849 --> 04:22:01.859 align:start position:0%
parent in in what is driving that and
 
04:22:04.750 --> 04:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not it is abuse and and and
 
04:22:08.570 --> 04:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
fear which is legitimate and and has to
 
04:22:10.070 --> 04:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
be accounted for in terms of whether
 
04:22:12.349 --> 04:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
that parent does have a role but also
 
04:22:14.929 --> 04:22:14.939 align:start position:0%
just is it time that is has led that
 
04:22:16.849 --> 04:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
person that child to have no interest in
 
04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
a in a relationship is it another parent
 
04:22:22.849 --> 04:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
that is causing uh information to go to
 
04:22:24.710 --> 04:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
that child that is causing that child to
 
04:22:26.870 --> 04:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
resist wanting the other parent involved
 
04:22:30.650 --> 04:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
and as she describes her testimony when
 
04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
she believes that that
 
04:22:35.809 --> 04:22:35.819 align:start position:0%
additional counseling is is appropriate
 
04:22:38.929 --> 04:22:38.939 align:start position:0%
and necessary given the lack of sort of
 
04:22:41.150 --> 04:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
information available to her and she's
 
04:22:43.729 --> 04:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
ordering counseling she does not simply
 
04:22:46.969 --> 04:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
order reunification therapy she talks to
 
04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
the parties about it because there has
 
04:22:51.229 --> 04:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
to be buy-in from the parties in
 
04:22:53.450 --> 04:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
identifying the counselor she will ask
 
04:22:56.269 --> 04:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
the frequently the the counselor is
 
04:22:58.670 --> 04:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
already involved don't have either the
 
04:23:00.650 --> 04:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
skill or the interest in bringing in
 
04:23:03.170 --> 04:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
what is necessary for this type of of
 
04:23:05.689 --> 04:23:05.699 align:start position:0%
counseling which is both parents the
 
04:23:09.110 --> 04:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
child and working with them as a group
 
04:23:14.210 --> 04:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
at times so she does ask the parents to
 
04:23:14.220 --> 04:23:16.210 align:start position:0%
at times so she does ask the parents to
solicit

04:23:16.210 --> 04:23:16.220 align:start position:0%
solicit
 
04:23:20.349 --> 04:23:20.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations of who could be the the
 
04:23:24.410 --> 04:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
counselor and reunification setting uh
 
04:23:26.269 --> 04:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
she can she would take those names if
 
04:23:28.849 --> 04:23:28.859 align:start position:0%
they infrequently the parties agree to
 
04:23:30.710 --> 04:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
who would be that counselor if they
 
04:23:32.809 --> 04:23:32.819 align:start position:0%
don't she asks for names that would come
 
04:23:35.750 --> 04:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
from sources preferably from existing
 
04:23:38.990 --> 04:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
counselors already involved in a in uh
 
04:23:40.610 --> 04:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
counseling the parties whether it be the
 
04:23:42.250 --> 04:23:42.260 align:start position:0%
parents or the child
 
04:23:44.830 --> 04:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day
 
04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
what is concerning about the bill is its
 
04:23:51.530 --> 04:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
breadth would eliminate all sort of
 
04:23:54.050 --> 04:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
counseling and therapy that relates to
 
04:23:58.010 --> 04:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
the the the reunification of of a child
 
04:24:01.429 --> 04:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
who is resisting uh a particular parent
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
for a reason that may not be abuse it
 
04:24:07.849 --> 04:24:07.859 align:start position:0%
may be a time it may be whatever it may
 
04:24:09.469 --> 04:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
be there's there's just almost an
 
04:24:12.290 --> 04:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
unlimited number of fact circumstances
 
04:24:17.150 --> 04:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
that can lead a child to resist and uh
 
04:24:20.929 --> 04:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
and if the if there is an opportunity to
 
04:24:23.570 --> 04:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
bring that family unit together and and
 
04:24:26.330 --> 04:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
at least in the as judge Lemire points
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
out it has been successful in in cases
 
04:24:33.590 --> 04:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
it is a tool that is available and we
 
04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
look we we feel that simply eliminating
 
04:24:39.050 --> 04:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
an entire category without more detail
 
04:24:41.150 --> 04:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
and specifics can lead to some
 
04:24:43.729 --> 04:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences so we do support
 
04:24:46.130 --> 04:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
we would be happy to participate with
 
04:24:49.030 --> 04:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
the with the chair whether it be in a a
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
retained Committee hearing or just with
 
04:24:53.990 --> 04:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and the parties to to work
 
04:24:56.750 --> 04:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
through exactly what is intended what is
 
04:24:59.330 --> 04:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
the the aspect of this that
 
04:25:01.849 --> 04:25:01.859 align:start position:0%
there's opposition and where in fact it
 
04:25:03.429 --> 04:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
can be useful
 
04:25:06.110 --> 04:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
so we oppose the bills written we would
 
04:25:08.210 --> 04:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
be happy to participate if the bill is
 
04:25:10.610 --> 04:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
retained it is a bill that seems to come
 
04:25:13.130 --> 04:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
up every year uh and fail every year so
 
04:25:15.290 --> 04:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
if there's a specific aspect of this
 
04:25:18.650 --> 04:25:18.660 align:start position:0%
that is uh the target then you know we'd
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
be happy to work with the committee and
 
04:25:22.729 --> 04:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
the sponsor to try to identify that but
 
04:25:25.309 --> 04:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
at least as written it would eliminate a
 
04:25:28.250 --> 04:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
tool that does get used and has been
 
04:25:31.309 --> 04:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
used successfully in the court system it
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
is an area I will confess I'm not at all
 
04:25:36.349 --> 04:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
an expert in so if you have questions
 
04:25:39.170 --> 04:25:39.180 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to try to answer them but I
 
04:25:41.809 --> 04:25:41.819 align:start position:0%
may have to defer but with that I'll
 
04:25:43.490 --> 04:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
conclude my comments but I'd be happy to
 
04:25:46.010 --> 04:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
attempt to answer anything now this is
 
04:25:48.050 --> 04:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon
 
04:25:50.630 --> 04:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh attorney head
 
04:25:53.450 --> 04:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
on the document passed out from Judge
 
04:25:56.450 --> 04:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
Lemire on page four it refers in the
 
04:26:01.010 --> 04:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
third paragraph down of um to allow
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
the entities to participate in
 
04:26:03.600 --> 04:26:04.969 align:start position:0%
the entities to participate in
counseling

04:26:04.969 --> 04:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
04:26:08.870 --> 04:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
and then it refers to a colleague's
 
04:26:10.969 --> 04:26:10.979 align:start position:0%
calling it reunification therapy has
 
04:26:13.130 --> 04:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
already heard that reunification therapy
 
04:26:14.510 --> 04:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
does not exist
 
04:26:17.269 --> 04:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
as a professional designation
 
04:26:18.889 --> 04:26:18.899 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:26:21.710 --> 04:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
the elimination of that in the in the
 
04:26:24.530 --> 04:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
review of the bill makes make this in a
 
04:26:28.189 --> 04:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
more appropriate Act
 
04:26:30.410 --> 04:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
so I think the real question is whatever
 
04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
we call it we have to ident we have to
 
04:26:34.729 --> 04:26:34.739 align:start position:0%
explain what that is and and that's why
 
04:26:36.469 --> 04:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
you'll see in judge lemire's letter
 
04:26:38.510 --> 04:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy being used in
 
04:26:42.290 --> 04:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
quotes and and and and the reality is as
 
04:26:45.170 --> 04:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
she said she wasn't sure what the scope
 
04:26:48.530 --> 04:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
was of of the intent of the bill and in
 
04:26:50.750 --> 04:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
that kind of ambiguity we may lose an
 
04:26:52.429 --> 04:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
important tool that in fact people agree
 
04:26:56.090 --> 04:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
is useful so I I and I may not have
 
04:26:58.309 --> 04:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
answered a question but but I'm not sure
 
04:27:00.889 --> 04:27:00.899 align:start position:0%
just changing the word would be would
 
04:27:03.469 --> 04:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
would cure the potential issue
 
04:27:05.389 --> 04:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
I'm going to follow up Mr chairman yes
 
04:27:08.210 --> 04:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you sir uh attorney then
 
04:27:11.330 --> 04:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
specific to the bill and I'm in favor of
 
04:27:16.250 --> 04:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
retaining uh this was where it states on
 
04:27:19.070 --> 04:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
line five uh was recommended by parties
 
04:27:21.649 --> 04:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
and if that a participating provider in
 
04:27:23.689 --> 04:27:23.699 align:start position:0%
the party's health insurance carrier
 
04:27:25.490 --> 04:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
it's the next sentence that's caused a
 
04:27:27.670 --> 04:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
concern and that's the identifier of
 
04:27:30.530 --> 04:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy again as an entity
 
04:27:32.929 --> 04:27:32.939 align:start position:0%
what would be your guidance
 
04:27:36.170 --> 04:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
on that so um so thank you for the
 
04:27:37.670 --> 04:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
question I think there are instances
 
04:27:37.680 --> 04:27:39.170 align:start position:0%
question I think there are instances
where

04:27:39.170 --> 04:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:27:42.530 --> 04:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
you can have it a counselor recommended
 
04:27:44.689 --> 04:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
by the parties and they're not
 
04:27:46.729 --> 04:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
participating a participating provider
 
04:27:48.649 --> 04:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
but the parties are willing and have the
 
04:27:51.110 --> 04:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
ability to pay
 
04:27:53.450 --> 04:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
um and as as judge Lemire said you know
 
04:27:55.309 --> 04:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
insurance if there is Insurance that's
 
04:27:56.809 --> 04:27:56.819 align:start position:0%
obviously the best but there are
 
04:28:00.710 --> 04:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
instances where there is not
 
04:28:03.050 --> 04:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
Insurance available for whatever reason
 
04:28:04.729 --> 04:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
but the parties have a willingness and
 
04:28:07.149 --> 04:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
an ability to pay and the ability to pay
 
04:28:11.149 --> 04:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
is a a part of her evaluation and and
 
04:28:13.250 --> 04:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
the parties do not have that ability to
 
04:28:15.649 --> 04:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
pay she does not order it and she has
 
04:28:17.809 --> 04:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
financial statements she has information
 
04:28:19.550 --> 04:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
available to her to make that
 
04:28:21.229 --> 04:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
determination so
 
04:28:24.469 --> 04:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
I would say simply saying all all
 
04:28:27.110 --> 04:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
Counseling Services have to be covered
 
04:28:30.530 --> 04:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
by a in insurance and that provider has
 
04:28:33.170 --> 04:28:33.180 align:start position:0%
to be covered by the insurance may be
 
04:28:35.750 --> 04:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
too restrictive if you make it a flat
 
04:28:35.760 --> 04:28:37.969 align:start position:0%
too restrictive if you make it a flat
obligation

04:28:37.969 --> 04:28:37.979 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
04:28:39.950 --> 04:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sir thank you Mr chairman
 
04:28:42.290 --> 04:28:42.300 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
04:28:44.090 --> 04:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you attorney head for
 
04:28:46.610 --> 04:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
coming and answering our questions
 
04:28:49.130 --> 04:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that there is
 
04:28:52.030 --> 04:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
um some tension and conflict between
 
04:28:54.830 --> 04:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
different parties using the same phrase
 
04:28:56.870 --> 04:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
to mean different things so it sounds
 
04:28:59.450 --> 04:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
like judges are using reunification
 
04:29:01.929 --> 04:29:01.939 align:start position:0%
therapy as kind of a catch-all
 
04:29:05.689 --> 04:29:05.699 align:start position:0%
generic term referring to any a various
 
04:29:08.809 --> 04:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
list of modalities of therapy that could
 
04:29:11.269 --> 04:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
lead to a family reunifying which is the
 
04:29:14.090 --> 04:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
Mandate frankly in a dcyf case you know
 
04:29:16.370 --> 04:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
as we move through there's a mandate to
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
try and reunify within 12 months so I
 
04:29:21.710 --> 04:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
guess my question is then
 
04:29:23.570 --> 04:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
um now that we are learning through this
 
04:29:27.830 --> 04:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
process that there is something that is
 
04:29:30.530 --> 04:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
um a questionable practice called
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy is it possible to
 
04:29:33.239 --> 04:29:34.370 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy is it possible to
have

04:29:34.370 --> 04:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:29:38.050 --> 04:29:38.060 align:start position:0%
um like advice or a Judicial note or
 
04:29:41.510 --> 04:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines for our judges to not use
 
04:29:43.910 --> 04:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
that term because it is so easily
 
04:29:46.429 --> 04:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
confused with a treatment modality that
 
04:29:49.550 --> 04:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
is not evidence-based and instead asks
 
04:29:51.910 --> 04:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
judges to refrain from using the term
 
04:29:55.010 --> 04:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy and use instead
 
04:29:56.750 --> 04:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
04:29:59.630 --> 04:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
um more clinically appropriate such as
 
04:30:01.969 --> 04:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
assessment and therapeutic intervention
 
04:30:04.490 --> 04:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
if warranted or I don't I'm not an
 
04:30:06.590 --> 04:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
attorney so you know crafting that would
 
04:30:08.990 --> 04:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
be better but to to consciously have
 
04:30:11.510 --> 04:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
judge consciously avoid using a term
 
04:30:15.189 --> 04:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
that is also the name of a very specific
 
04:30:17.030 --> 04:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
non-evidence-based treatment modality
 
04:30:19.130 --> 04:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
just like they wouldn't order you know
 
04:30:22.370 --> 04:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
CBC therapy or you know dialectic
 
04:30:24.590 --> 04:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
behavioral therapy because that's not in
 
04:30:26.210 --> 04:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
their purview
 
04:30:27.710 --> 04:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
I'm so thank you for the question I
 
04:30:27.720 --> 04:30:29.210 align:start position:0%
I'm so thank you for the question I
think

04:30:29.210 --> 04:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:30:31.550 --> 04:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
in part the answer is yes
 
04:30:34.010 --> 04:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
um but in part the the concern would
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
still be if
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
a a bill is passed that prohibits quote
 
04:30:40.370 --> 04:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
unquote reunification therapy without
 
04:30:42.889 --> 04:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
defining that the scope of that could
 
04:30:42.899 --> 04:30:44.149 align:start position:0%
defining that the scope of that could
include

04:30:44.149 --> 04:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
include
 
04:30:46.490 --> 04:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
anything that that where where the
 
04:30:49.010 --> 04:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
reunification of the parties is I mean
 
04:30:51.710 --> 04:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
it's such a basic word and doesn't seem
 
04:30:54.950 --> 04:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
to have a a certainly within the bill a
 
04:30:57.050 --> 04:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
definition of what is being included in
 
04:30:59.090 --> 04:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
that term
 
04:31:02.630 --> 04:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
um that even if we did go ahead and have
 
04:31:05.050 --> 04:31:05.060 align:start position:0%
guidance and and
 
04:31:08.210 --> 04:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
a process where the term reunification
 
04:31:10.250 --> 04:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
therapy was not used it may still be
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
considered within the scope of that if
 
04:31:15.229 --> 04:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
if we have a flat out legislative
 
04:31:17.630 --> 04:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
prohibition on on this type of of
 
04:31:17.640 --> 04:31:19.670 align:start position:0%
prohibition on on this type of of
counseling

04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
04:31:21.170 --> 04:31:21.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:31:25.189 --> 04:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
so and again that just leads to I given
 
04:31:27.769 --> 04:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
that this is a bill that comes up on
 
04:31:29.870 --> 04:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
right with a on a regular basis
 
04:31:32.030 --> 04:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
it would help to retain it and see if
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
there is a way of of putting that you
 
04:31:36.349 --> 04:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
know those two pieces as you described
 
04:31:38.389 --> 04:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
together that that don't conflict with
 
04:31:41.570 --> 04:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:43.910 --> 04:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you counselor thank you
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%

today my name is Gail drobat I'm from
 
04:33:17.090 --> 04:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
Amherst New Hampshire
 
04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
I am a mom that has never been involved
 
04:33:22.551 --> 04:33:22.561 align:start position:0%
in the family court but
 
04:33:24.590 --> 04:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
this has come up a lot with the
 
04:33:26.810 --> 04:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
reunification from parents I've talked
 
04:33:26.820 --> 04:33:27.949 align:start position:0%
reunification from parents I've talked
to

04:33:27.949 --> 04:33:27.959 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:33:29.689 --> 04:33:29.699 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk about one specific
 
04:33:32.209 --> 04:33:32.219 align:start position:0%
case without any names
 
04:33:32.219 --> 04:33:32.869 align:start position:0%
case without any names
um

04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:33.830 --> 04:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to give you this
 
04:33:37.789 --> 04:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:39.890 --> 04:33:39.900 align:start position:0%
the family was ordered
 
04:33:43.789 --> 04:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
to have the child engage with an
 
04:33:46.010 --> 04:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
individual therapist for the child to
 
04:33:48.470 --> 04:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
speak about his feelings
 
04:33:51.890 --> 04:33:51.900 align:start position:0%
the therapist allowed mom in that those
 
04:33:51.900 --> 04:33:53.029 align:start position:0%
the therapist allowed mom in that those
sessions

04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
04:33:56.929 --> 04:33:56.939 align:start position:0%
gave dad minimal information
 
04:34:00.289 --> 04:34:00.299 align:start position:0%
she said she saw him twice
 
04:34:02.750 --> 04:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
and told Dad that it would take several
 
04:34:04.789 --> 04:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
more sessions for him to be comfortable
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
to open up and then she wrote a bad
 
04:34:10.310 --> 04:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:12.051 --> 04:34:12.061 align:start position:0%
she recommended a reunification
 
04:34:14.631 --> 04:34:14.641 align:start position:0%
therapist two doors down in her same
 
04:34:14.641 --> 04:34:15.709 align:start position:0%
therapist two doors down in her same
building

04:34:15.709 --> 04:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
building
 
04:34:19.150 --> 04:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
so you can imagine dad's reluctance
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
once asked what he would do to assess
 
04:34:25.310 --> 04:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
diagnose and treat this situation
 
04:34:29.689 --> 04:34:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:33.170 --> 04:34:33.180 align:start position:0%
so this child hasn't seen his father in
 
04:34:35.689 --> 04:34:35.699 align:start position:0%
five years or any other member of his
 
04:34:38.209 --> 04:34:38.219 align:start position:0%
father's family
 
04:34:39.709 --> 04:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
so the court orders another
 
04:34:42.230 --> 04:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
reunification therapist
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
recommended by a long-standing bar
 
04:34:46.551 --> 04:34:46.561 align:start position:0%
member who they won't release the name
 
04:34:46.561 --> 04:34:49.310 align:start position:0%
member who they won't release the name
of

04:34:49.310 --> 04:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:52.131 --> 04:34:52.141 align:start position:0%
he contacted her on November 2nd no
 
04:34:55.330 --> 04:34:55.340 align:start position:0%
response November 19th no response
 
04:34:58.070 --> 04:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
December 20th
 
04:35:05.090 --> 04:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:07.429 --> 04:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
she said in response to your inquiry
 
04:35:09.769 --> 04:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
about reunification counseling I am
 
04:35:11.510 --> 04:35:11.520 align:start position:0%

04:35:11.520 --> 04:35:13.789 align:start position:0%

agreement

04:35:13.789 --> 04:35:13.799 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
04:35:16.429 --> 04:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
and get back to me
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
January 21st 2022 he says
 
04:35:24.590 --> 04:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
when's the soonest you can see us
 
04:35:28.670 --> 04:35:28.680 align:start position:0%

received from un the other party I
 
04:35:35.029 --> 04:35:35.039 align:start position:0%
unfortunately do not accept expect to

have any availability for several months
 
04:35:40.670 --> 04:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
after she told the court she would take
 
04:35:44.090 --> 04:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:47.929 --> 04:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
then again on April 22nd he said my son
 
04:35:49.730 --> 04:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
and I were court ordered to engage with
 
04:35:49.740 --> 04:35:51.529 align:start position:0%

no response
 
04:35:59.330 --> 04:35:59.340 align:start position:0%

04:36:12.349 --> 04:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:12.359 --> 04:36:16.570 align:start position:0%
 
ah

04:36:16.570 --> 04:36:16.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:24.470 --> 04:36:24.480 align:start position:0%

therapy
 
04:36:31.070 --> 04:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
on April 14th she says I received your
 
04:36:32.929 --> 04:36:32.939 align:start position:0%
email regarding court ordered family
 
04:36:35.150 --> 04:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
therapy unfortunately my practice is
 
04:36:35.160 --> 04:36:38.090 align:start position:0%
therapy unfortunately my practice is
full

04:36:38.090 --> 04:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:40.789 --> 04:36:40.799 align:start position:0%
five years this child has not seen his
 
04:36:40.799 --> 04:36:42.830 align:start position:0%
five years this child has not seen his
father

04:36:42.830 --> 04:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
father
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
and for the court to keep going this
 
04:36:49.609 --> 04:36:49.619 align:start position:0%
and dad has made multiple motions to
 
04:36:51.970 --> 04:36:51.980 align:start position:0%
have it referred to other therapists
 
04:36:55.730 --> 04:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
denied denied denied
 
04:36:55.740 --> 04:36:58.131 align:start position:0%
denied denied denied
so

04:36:58.131 --> 04:36:58.141 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:02.029 --> 04:37:02.039 align:start position:0%
my request to you all and we just heard
 
04:37:05.510 --> 04:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
that reunification isn't a therapy
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
you've got half a minute I'm going to
 
04:37:10.131 --> 04:37:10.141 align:start position:0%
give you this after so
 
04:37:13.910 --> 04:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
I think court ordered therapy involved
 
04:37:16.131 --> 04:37:16.141 align:start position:0%
in family court systems need to be done
 
04:37:18.349 --> 04:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
with a clinical psychologist with a
 
04:37:20.689 --> 04:37:20.699 align:start position:0%
minimal of family systems therapy to
 
04:37:23.150 --> 04:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
figure out the breakdown of the family
 
04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
these kids cannot go weeks months years
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
without seeing both parents if there is
 
04:37:33.529 --> 04:37:33.539 align:start position:0%
an attachment pathology you better get
 
04:37:35.330 --> 04:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
it fixed quickly because you're ruining
 
04:37:37.490 --> 04:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
the lives of these children may we ask
 
04:37:40.131 --> 04:37:40.141 align:start position:0%
you a question you sure can my question
 
04:37:42.590 --> 04:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
is this if there was a licensed in the
 
04:37:44.631 --> 04:37:44.641 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire therapist of some
 
04:37:49.010 --> 04:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
type and this push push push and ignore
 
04:37:51.709 --> 04:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
ignore ignore took place there is a
 
04:37:53.570 --> 04:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
board where a complaint may be filed
 
04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
where is the board for UNIF unification
 
04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
therapy the Mental Health Board
 
04:38:02.570 --> 04:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
and a complaint was filed and there was
 
04:38:04.429 --> 04:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
no wrongdoing found
 
04:38:06.949 --> 04:38:06.959 align:start position:0%
there was a complaint to The JCC no
 
04:38:08.990 --> 04:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing found there was a complaint
 
04:38:11.390 --> 04:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
to the attorney discipline office no
 
04:38:11.400 --> 04:38:13.789 align:start position:0%
to the attorney discipline office no
finding

04:38:13.789 --> 04:38:13.799 align:start position:0%
finding
 
04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk about that on another
 
04:38:18.349 --> 04:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
bill but
 
04:38:18.359 --> 04:38:19.250 align:start position:0%
bill but
um

04:38:19.250 --> 04:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:22.250 --> 04:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
I think we really need to sit down with
 
04:38:25.551 --> 04:38:25.561 align:start position:0%
all parties and the Judiciary and figure
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
out something for these kids because at
 
04:38:29.330 --> 04:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
the end of the day the kids are the ones
 
04:38:31.429 --> 04:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
being abused and it's got to stop
 
04:38:33.769 --> 04:38:33.779 align:start position:0%
they're our future does anyone else have
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
any questions besides me representative
 
04:38:38.929 --> 04:38:38.939 align:start position:0%
Petrino thank you chairman and thank you
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just a little
 
04:38:41.929 --> 04:38:41.939 align:start position:0%
bit confused so I just need some
 
04:38:43.789 --> 04:38:43.799 align:start position:0%
clarification sure the bill we're
 
04:38:45.289 --> 04:38:45.299 align:start position:0%
looking at prohibits the use of
 
04:38:47.929 --> 04:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy but the situation
 
04:38:50.269 --> 04:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
that you explained was that this
 
04:38:51.769 --> 04:38:51.779 align:start position:0%
individual was trying to get
 
04:38:55.250 --> 04:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy for five years or
 
04:38:58.131 --> 04:38:58.141 align:start position:0%
more awarded by the courts and could not
 
04:39:00.590 --> 04:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
make this happen right so I'm just
 
04:39:02.830 --> 04:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
confused it sounds like
 
04:39:05.631 --> 04:39:05.641 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy was something that
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
was welcomed but this bill says that we
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
should prohibit it and that's where I'm
 
04:39:13.970 --> 04:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
confused the court ordered it
 
04:39:15.949 --> 04:39:15.959 align:start position:0%
I think it should be prohibited it
 
04:39:15.959 --> 04:39:18.109 align:start position:0%
I think it should be prohibited it
doesn't

04:39:18.109 --> 04:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
04:39:18.119 --> 04:39:19.910 align:start position:0%
doesn't
address

04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
address
 
04:39:22.070 --> 04:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
um well it's a non-established therapy
 
04:39:26.869 --> 04:39:26.879 align:start position:0%
first off so they need to address the um
 
04:39:29.510 --> 04:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
why the parent the child has an
 
04:39:31.789 --> 04:39:31.799 align:start position:0%
attachment pathology why is a rejection
 
04:39:31.799 --> 04:39:33.051 align:start position:0%
attachment pathology why is a rejection
apparent

04:39:33.051 --> 04:39:33.061 align:start position:0%
apparent
 
04:39:35.449 --> 04:39:35.459 align:start position:0%
you know and that should be done
 
04:39:37.368 --> 04:39:37.378 align:start position:0%
immediately if they're going into family
 
04:39:40.010 --> 04:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
court and a child's rejecting a parent
 
04:39:43.070 --> 04:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
you better find out why quickly because
 
04:39:43.080 --> 04:39:44.750 align:start position:0%
you better find out why quickly because
either

04:39:44.750 --> 04:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
the parent that has the child is abusing
 
04:39:48.530 --> 04:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
them psychologically and keeping them
 
04:39:50.750 --> 04:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
away from one parent or the other parent
 
04:39:53.930 --> 04:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
has abused them so either way
 
04:39:56.510 --> 04:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
you better do something quick and this
 
04:39:59.570 --> 04:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:02.448 --> 04:40:02.458 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:40:04.730 --> 04:40:04.740 align:start position:0%

um so thank you for allowing me to be
 
04:40:32.330 --> 04:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
here today I do have written testimony
 
04:40:33.890 --> 04:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
but every time I hear somebody else say
 
04:40:36.230 --> 04:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
something my the thoughts of my head
 
04:40:38.630 --> 04:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
change so I'm going to do this as best
 
04:40:40.670 --> 04:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
as I can as quickly as I can my name is
 
04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
Kathy Jones I'm with Mother Justice
 
04:40:44.570 --> 04:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
Network I do not have a string of
 
04:40:46.610 --> 04:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
letters after my name but I have 25
 
04:40:48.890 --> 04:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
years in the business of domestic
 
04:40:51.288 --> 04:40:51.298 align:start position:0%
violence and been a national expert on
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and the reason I'm
 
04:40:55.690 --> 04:40:55.700 align:start position:0%
here today is because high conflict
 
04:40:59.750 --> 04:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
family court cases is equal to domestic
 
04:41:02.150 --> 04:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
violence related cases they are one in
 
04:41:06.350 --> 04:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
the same and in a vast majority of these
 
04:41:08.208 --> 04:41:08.218 align:start position:0%
type of cases that end up in Family
 
04:41:10.430 --> 04:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
Court which is different from Child
 
04:41:12.530 --> 04:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
Protection court and I understand that
 
04:41:14.330 --> 04:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
child protection has its uses for
 
04:41:16.850 --> 04:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
reunification but I'm specifically here
 
04:41:18.350 --> 04:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
to talk about family court and
 
04:41:21.350 --> 04:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
reunification therapies today
 
04:41:21.360 --> 04:41:23.030 align:start position:0%
reunification therapies today
um

04:41:23.030 --> 04:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:25.610 --> 04:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
there is so much damage being done
 
04:41:27.650 --> 04:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
across the state by courts who are
 
04:41:30.650 --> 04:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
ordering children to be forced into
 
04:41:34.490 --> 04:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
reunification therapies with parents who
 
04:41:36.530 --> 04:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
are abusive not only to the children
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
themselves but also to their former
 
04:41:41.990 --> 04:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
intimate partner which is creating just
 
04:41:45.530 --> 04:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:47.510 --> 04:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
both for the families and individually
 
04:41:49.850 --> 04:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
but for the court systems themselves who
 
04:41:52.970 --> 04:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
are overwhelmed by these high conflict
 
04:41:54.770 --> 04:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
cases that keep coming back in coming
 
04:41:56.930 --> 04:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
back in coming back in because there is
 
04:41:58.690 --> 04:41:58.700 align:start position:0%
no end in sight
 
04:42:01.788 --> 04:42:01.798 align:start position:0%
divorce is a industry it's a 50 billion
 
04:42:04.310 --> 04:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
dollar industry in the country and
 
04:42:07.310 --> 04:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy I feel like is
 
04:42:09.288 --> 04:42:09.298 align:start position:0%
responsible for at least half of it
 
04:42:12.890 --> 04:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
there is no regulation it practitioners
 
04:42:14.628 --> 04:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
can charge whatever the heck they want
 
04:42:17.690 --> 04:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
it's all out of pocket paid and this is
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
money that should be going for better
 
04:42:23.170 --> 04:42:23.180 align:start position:0%
things like child support and actually
 
04:42:25.490 --> 04:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
helping the individuals and the families
 
04:42:25.500 --> 04:42:26.868 align:start position:0%
helping the individuals and the families
involved

04:42:26.868 --> 04:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
involved
 
04:42:30.590 --> 04:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
in 2018 and 2019
 
04:42:33.590 --> 04:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
I I don't know I'm sorry I forgot to say
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm a completely unfunded program by the
 
04:42:39.708 --> 04:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
way and my entire life is devoted to
 
04:42:41.208 --> 04:42:41.218 align:start position:0%
protective parents who are trying to
 
04:42:42.470 --> 04:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
keep their children safe through the
 
04:42:44.208 --> 04:42:44.218 align:start position:0%
family court system you've got one
 
04:42:48.050 --> 04:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
minute okay in 2018 and 2019 I'd put
 
04:42:50.750 --> 04:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
together a support group for protective
 
04:42:53.150 --> 04:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
parents who are trying to deal with the
 
04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
fact that their children were becoming
 
04:42:57.650 --> 04:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
suicidal because of their reunification
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
therapies that they were being forced
 
04:43:02.590 --> 04:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
into these reunification therapists were
 
04:43:04.970 --> 04:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
denying their children's experiences
 
04:43:08.090 --> 04:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
were threatening the children were
 
04:43:10.610 --> 04:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
basically bullying these children into
 
04:43:12.890 --> 04:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
having contact with family members that
 
04:43:14.930 --> 04:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
frightened these children
 
04:43:18.110 --> 04:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
right now I'm dealing with a mother if
 
04:43:21.708 --> 04:43:21.718 align:start position:0%
somewhere midpoint in our state whose ex
 
04:43:24.288 --> 04:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
was actually convicted of and spent time
 
04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
in jail for raping her and she has been
 
04:43:29.330 --> 04:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
recently notified that the judge in her
 
04:43:31.788 --> 04:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
case is going to be forcing her children
 
04:43:34.670 --> 04:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
into reunification therapy with the
 
04:43:36.890 --> 04:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
father even though he admitted in Family
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:43.550 --> 04:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
and this is the type of stuff that I
 
04:43:48.050 --> 04:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
deal with day in and day out I am
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
exhausted by being a one-person
 
04:43:53.930 --> 04:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
practitioner who is dealing with the
 
04:43:56.810 --> 04:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
the dregs of what happens when these
 
04:43:59.330 --> 04:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
family courts systems get this issue
 
04:44:01.850 --> 04:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
wrong thank you for your testimony I
 
04:44:01.860 --> 04:44:02.750 align:start position:0%
wrong thank you for your testimony I
will

04:44:02.750 --> 04:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:44:07.250 --> 04:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
um ask if anyone has any questions
 
04:44:08.810 --> 04:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
in which
 
04:44:12.550 --> 04:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
case thank you for your testimony
 
04:44:16.010 --> 04:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
you'll have 30 seconds then that's
 
04:44:17.570 --> 04:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
the reason there's a difference between
 
04:44:20.570 --> 04:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
dcyf and family court is because dcyf as
 
04:44:22.730 --> 04:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
imperfect as that system may be they
 
04:44:24.948 --> 04:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
have experts in domestic violence that
 
04:44:27.050 --> 04:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
are embedded within their systems that
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
could at least consult with them and
 
04:44:30.650 --> 04:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
give them guidance as what to do the
 
04:44:32.810 --> 04:44:32.820 align:start position:0%
family courts do not utilize such
 
04:44:35.090 --> 04:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
experts and mental health practitioners
 
04:44:37.610 --> 04:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
and any other professional out there are
 
04:44:40.010 --> 04:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
not experts in domestic and Family
 
04:44:42.410 --> 04:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
Violence thank you so much a key problem
 
04:44:45.410 --> 04:44:45.420 align:start position:0%

04:45:02.448 --> 04:45:02.458 align:start position:0%
for someone from Houston you can talk
 
04:45:02.458 --> 04:45:06.650 align:start position:0%
for someone from Houston you can talk
quick

04:45:06.650 --> 04:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.948 --> 04:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
representative gay is late of this
 
04:45:13.788 --> 04:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
committee and had represented uh plasto
 
04:45:15.770 --> 04:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
and Atkinson for a while representative
 
04:45:15.780 --> 04:45:18.770 align:start position:0%
and Atkinson for a while representative
gay

04:45:18.770 --> 04:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:22.788 --> 04:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
turn it on thank you okay okay to be
 
04:45:25.788 --> 04:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
fast I made some points how
 
04:45:28.910 --> 04:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy gets ordered
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
person files for divorce and alleges
 
04:45:34.490 --> 04:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
domestic violence they automatically are
 
04:45:37.270 --> 04:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
referred to high conflict Court
 
04:45:39.890 --> 04:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
gals are assigned to the children the
 
04:45:42.288 --> 04:45:42.298 align:start position:0%
parents do not get to choose the gals
 
04:45:44.868 --> 04:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
the gal asks the children if they want
 
04:45:47.330 --> 04:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
to be with both parents this assessment
 
04:45:49.430 --> 04:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
can take all of 15 minutes
 
04:45:51.890 --> 04:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
the GAO recommends the children be
 
04:45:55.310 --> 04:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
ordered to reunification therapy with or
 
04:45:56.930 --> 04:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
without the parent that they don't want
 
04:45:59.628 --> 04:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
to see if the children are reluctant to
 
04:46:01.128 --> 04:46:01.138 align:start position:0%
see one of the parents
 
04:46:03.230 --> 04:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
the parents have no choice of the
 
04:46:03.240 --> 04:46:04.730 align:start position:0%
the parents have no choice of the
counselor

04:46:04.730 --> 04:46:04.740 align:start position:0%
counselor
 
04:46:06.770 --> 04:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
the parent is told that if they don't
 
04:46:09.350 --> 04:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
take the children that parent will lose
 
04:46:13.610 --> 04:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
custody it is a absolute threat
 
04:46:15.770 --> 04:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
the parent takes the child
 
04:46:17.650 --> 04:46:17.660 align:start position:0%
they pay 100
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
150 an hour to anywhere as high as 350
 
04:46:23.510 --> 04:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
an hour
 
04:46:25.788 --> 04:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
there's no assessment of charge there's
 
04:46:28.368 --> 04:46:28.378 align:start position:0%
no assessment of Cause part of
 
04:46:31.368 --> 04:46:31.378 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy as you will see in
 
04:46:34.910 --> 04:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
this notice of an email from a physician
 
04:46:37.448 --> 04:46:37.458 align:start position:0%
from an attorney family attorney
 
04:46:39.650 --> 04:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
mentioning the training for the
 
04:46:41.868 --> 04:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
attorneys our attorneys here get this
 
04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
training and they are taught that this
 
04:46:47.810 --> 04:46:47.820 align:start position:0%
is greater than sliced bread
 
04:46:50.030 --> 04:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
the parent takes the child there's no
 
04:46:52.368 --> 04:46:52.378 align:start position:0%
assessment a cause the child has been
 
04:46:55.368 --> 04:46:55.378 align:start position:0%
that has been subjected to threats
 
04:46:57.770 --> 04:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
by the counselor by the reach
 
04:47:00.110 --> 04:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy counselor the
 
04:47:02.208 --> 04:47:02.218 align:start position:0%
child is told if you don't get with the
 
04:47:04.368 --> 04:47:04.378 align:start position:0%
program we are going to make you live
 
04:47:05.868 --> 04:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
with this parent you don't want to be
 
04:47:05.878 --> 04:47:07.368 align:start position:0%
with this parent you don't want to be
with

04:47:07.368 --> 04:47:07.378 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:47:09.470 --> 04:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's more to that but that's
 
04:47:13.070 --> 04:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
a good basic okay the uh what I just
 
04:47:15.288 --> 04:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
referred in a minute and 15.
 
04:47:15.298 --> 04:47:16.550 align:start position:0%
referred in a minute and 15.
okay

04:47:16.550 --> 04:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:47:19.430 --> 04:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
um you will see on this letter uh that
 
04:47:21.170 --> 04:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
as you can see special attention is
 
04:47:23.830 --> 04:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
given to ensuring the child in question
 
04:47:27.708 --> 04:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
this is training for attorneys as you
 
04:47:30.830 --> 04:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
can see in RT the child in question is
 
04:47:33.770 --> 04:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
not given an F opportunity to validate
 
04:47:36.708 --> 04:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
his or her fears of the allegedly
 
04:47:39.948 --> 04:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
abusive parent nor to express grievances
 
04:47:42.530 --> 04:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
against that parent I know this lawyer
 
04:47:44.150 --> 04:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
who wrote it is aware of published
 
04:47:46.368 --> 04:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
critiques of approaches to such cases
 
04:47:48.530 --> 04:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
based on past and its Affiliated
 
04:47:51.230 --> 04:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
theories possibly my own work but it's
 
04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
nevertheless confidently telling lawyers
 
04:47:57.530 --> 04:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
to ignore the child's perspective
 
04:48:00.890 --> 04:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
so there therein lies the absolute
 
04:48:03.650 --> 04:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
cruelty of this practice it doesn't
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
matter what the child feels but so many
 
04:48:09.830 --> 04:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
people are making their livings on this
 
04:48:12.350 --> 04:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
whole system to change it it's like
 
04:48:16.128 --> 04:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
digging out a mountain with a tablespoon
 
04:48:18.890 --> 04:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
but I have confidence that there are so
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
many caring people here that we can
 
04:48:23.448 --> 04:48:23.458 align:start position:0%
start turning this around
 
04:48:25.850 --> 04:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
thank you representative do you have a
 
04:48:28.368 --> 04:48:28.378 align:start position:0%
handouts you'd like us to read my plan
 
04:48:31.250 --> 04:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
is to exec this bill on the 21st two
 
04:48:33.170 --> 04:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
weeks from today
 
04:48:33.180 --> 04:48:38.870 align:start position:0%
weeks from today
foreign

04:48:38.870 --> 04:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:38.880 --> 04:48:47.810 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:48:47.810 --> 04:48:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:55.430 --> 04:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
um we received some documents here and
 
04:49:01.910 --> 04:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's uh this is me speaking now I'm not
 
04:49:03.708 --> 04:49:03.718 align:start position:0%
likely to take them seriously they're
 
04:49:06.470 --> 04:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
not identified as to who they came from
 
04:49:08.990 --> 04:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
and that is probably just an oversight
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
on your part
 
04:49:12.830 --> 04:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
um in a minute here between in the break
 
04:49:14.570 --> 04:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
between this bill and the next one if
 
04:49:16.910 --> 04:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
you could sign in that would really make
 
04:49:26.150 --> 04:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:29.868 --> 04:49:29.878 align:start position:0%
so with that I am closing the hearing on
 
04:49:33.350 --> 04:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 306 and if a group of you
 
04:49:35.030 --> 04:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
want to get together over the summer and
 
04:49:37.310 --> 04:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
work on this and eventually we will take
 
04:49:39.650 --> 04:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
it off the table that's fine my
 
04:49:42.190 --> 04:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
suggestion to you as it is to everyone
 
04:49:44.810 --> 04:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
when assertions are made
 
04:49:46.850 --> 04:49:46.860 align:start position:0%
I want to see footnotes I want to see
 
04:49:50.390 --> 04:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
documentation is if there are people who
 
04:49:52.850 --> 04:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
said that I would like to the degree
 
04:49:54.410 --> 04:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
that they are willing to give their
 
04:49:56.810 --> 04:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
names which adds to their credibility we
 
04:49:58.368 --> 04:49:58.378 align:start position:0%
would do that
 
04:50:00.288 --> 04:50:00.298 align:start position:0%
um yeah they put themselves at a bit of
 
04:50:02.448 --> 04:50:02.458 align:start position:0%
a risk to do that but I want to be able
 
04:50:05.208 --> 04:50:05.218 align:start position:0%
to take them seriously and if there's
 
04:50:07.670 --> 04:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
cases of we spent a hundred thousand
 
04:50:10.490 --> 04:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
prove your case is what I'm saying at
 
04:50:12.890 --> 04:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
prove find a good balanced position
 
04:50:16.250 --> 04:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
Define your terms prove your case so
 
04:50:18.708 --> 04:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
then when it comes back here in the fall
 
04:50:21.170 --> 04:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
we'll have something more substantial to
 
04:50:24.170 --> 04:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
work on so thank you so much
 
04:50:26.930 --> 04:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to take about a
 
04:50:31.010 --> 04:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
five minute uh recess while we regroup
 
04:50:32.868 --> 04:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
and all these nice papers that
 
04:50:35.810 --> 04:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
representative gay has given us are duly
 
04:50:47.230 --> 04:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:07.250 --> 04:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:11.110 --> 04:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
also this is for the committee uh the uh
 
04:51:14.990 --> 04:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
the email the printout that attorney had
 
04:51:17.030 --> 04:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
to hand it out has a typo on the front
 
04:51:20.288 --> 04:51:20.298 align:start position:0%
that may confuse you this is House Bill
 
04:51:26.270 --> 04:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
306 not 603 603 is where we live 306 is
 
04:51:28.610 --> 04:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
the bill change it so it doesn't get
 
04:51:28.620 --> 04:51:30.350 align:start position:0%
the bill change it so it doesn't get
misfiled

04:51:30.350 --> 04:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
misfiled
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
um as a friend of mine says he's not
 
04:51:35.770 --> 04:51:35.780 align:start position:0%
dyslexic he's less dxic
 
04:51:52.990 --> 04:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:00.410 --> 04:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:02.990 --> 04:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering are we executing any
 
04:52:05.330 --> 04:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
other bills today
 
04:52:05.340 --> 05:00:26.170 align:start position:0%

05:00:29.150 --> 05:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
opening the hearing on House Bill 490

wanted was a straight answer
 
05:02:07.970 --> 05:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher huh yes as I said

earlier today this is the Rowdy section
 
05:02:13.190 --> 05:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
I'm disappointed it was my intent to
 
05:02:17.930 --> 05:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:19.430 --> 05:02:19.440 align:start position:0%

I thank you

05:04:00.410 --> 05:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:02.930 --> 05:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
okay let's turn our fun to the bill in
 
05:04:06.890 --> 05:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
front of us over there our s
 
05:04:08.750 --> 05:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
Rowdy section
 
05:04:10.690 --> 05:04:10.700 align:start position:0%
and what do you think about the bill
 
05:04:12.830 --> 05:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative Greg what do you think
 
05:04:15.350 --> 05:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
about the bill
 
05:04:18.288 --> 05:04:18.298 align:start position:0%
after you've turned your mic on
 
05:04:20.390 --> 05:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
all right here I was thinking I wasn't
 
05:04:22.910 --> 05:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
Rowdy and I'm like full-on Rowdy called
 
05:04:22.920 --> 05:04:24.110 align:start position:0%
Rowdy and I'm like full-on Rowdy called
out

05:04:24.110 --> 05:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:04:26.150 --> 05:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
um you were not called out you were
 
05:04:26.160 --> 05:04:27.770 align:start position:0%
um you were not called out you were
selected

05:04:27.770 --> 05:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
selected
 
05:04:30.410 --> 05:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
that sounds so much better
 
05:04:30.420 --> 05:04:31.670 align:start position:0%
that sounds so much better
uh

05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
so I actually I I think this I just
 
05:04:36.350 --> 05:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
think the language
 
05:04:39.590 --> 05:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
um we're just discussing right point of
 
05:04:42.230 --> 05:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
order uh should we do have somebody
 
05:04:44.270 --> 05:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak on the bill so prior
 
05:04:46.490 --> 05:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
to discussion oh this is true
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
somebody speak
 
05:04:51.770 --> 05:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
I do have a card I have a card
 
05:04:55.310 --> 05:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
she's so patient over the the chair
 
05:05:01.010 --> 05:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
recognizes from d c y f e s q
 
05:05:02.868 --> 05:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
that's Murchison
 
05:05:04.850 --> 05:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
who actually has been sitting there
 
05:05:07.570 --> 05:05:07.580 align:start position:0%
waiting for sanity to break out
 
05:05:11.868 --> 05:05:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:13.788 --> 05:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
all kidding aside thank you Mr chair
 
05:05:15.230 --> 05:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
Vice chair and other members of the
 
05:05:16.490 --> 05:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
committee so
 
05:05:18.050 --> 05:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
um the division
 
05:05:19.670 --> 05:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
um it appreciates the opportunity to
 
05:05:22.010 --> 05:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill in general the
 
05:05:24.050 --> 05:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
division is not in favor of modifying
 
05:05:28.490 --> 05:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
the definition of neglect uh neglect is
 
05:05:31.628 --> 05:05:31.638 align:start position:0%
a very fact-specific case specific
 
05:05:35.448 --> 05:05:35.458 align:start position:0%
situation and the enumeration of sort of
 
05:05:38.030 --> 05:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
activities under this this legislation
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
would make that very very complicated
 
05:05:42.708 --> 05:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
for the division that said
 
05:05:44.628 --> 05:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
um you know we we generally sort of
 
05:05:47.208 --> 05:05:47.218 align:start position:0%
review this suggested language change as
 
05:05:49.310 --> 05:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
sort of the free-range child kind of
 
05:05:49.320 --> 05:05:50.930 align:start position:0%
sort of the free-range child kind of
provision

05:05:50.930 --> 05:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
provision
 
05:05:53.448 --> 05:05:53.458 align:start position:0%
um and in general I mean the division
 
05:05:56.030 --> 05:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
does not file for neglect on free-range
 
05:05:59.510 --> 05:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
children so we just wanted to appreciate
 
05:06:01.850 --> 05:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to share our thoughts
 
05:06:04.730 --> 05:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
with the committee on this Bill thank
 
05:06:06.890 --> 05:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
you I'm happy to take any questions if
 
05:06:08.930 --> 05:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
anyone has any
 
05:06:12.830 --> 05:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
would you define free-range child
 
05:06:14.720 --> 05:06:14.730 align:start position:0%
you know when you see one right
 
05:06:14.730 --> 05:06:16.690 align:start position:0%
you know when you see one right
[Laughter]

05:06:16.690 --> 05:06:16.700 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:06:19.788 --> 05:06:19.798 align:start position:0%
if it walks like a duck quacks like a
 
05:06:22.190 --> 05:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
duck no uh you know free range child is
 
05:06:24.170 --> 05:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
is one who's given a certain amount of
 
05:06:26.510 --> 05:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
independence by their parents
 
05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
um depending on their maturity and and
 
05:06:32.930 --> 05:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
um their uh their sort of capabilities
 
05:06:35.150 --> 05:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
um I think New Hampshire has a sort of a
 
05:06:36.890 --> 05:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
night I mean I'm from New Jersey and I
 
05:06:39.410 --> 05:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
think New Hampshire has a nice sort of
 
05:06:40.970 --> 05:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
um tradition of that and I think it
 
05:06:43.610 --> 05:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
makes for healthy this is me talking so
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
but I think that it does make for
 
05:06:46.368 --> 05:06:46.378 align:start position:0%
healthy development for children that's
 
05:06:48.350 --> 05:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
generally what I think of as a
 
05:06:51.708 --> 05:06:51.718 align:start position:0%
free-range child yeah follow-up question
 
05:06:54.590 --> 05:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
um would you see this bill a solution
 
05:06:56.868 --> 05:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
looking for a problem is there a problem
 
05:06:59.208 --> 05:06:59.218 align:start position:0%
of uh inhibited
 
05:07:01.070 --> 05:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
pre-range children
 
05:07:03.050 --> 05:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
no the division would say that we don't
 
05:07:05.570 --> 05:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that
 
05:07:07.970 --> 05:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
so you don't follow up to myself you
 
05:07:09.948 --> 05:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
don't see that there's there's a bunch
 
05:07:12.550 --> 05:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
of kids that are really being trapped
 
05:07:15.230 --> 05:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
that could be able to walk to school
 
05:07:18.948 --> 05:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
because they're 17 or things like that
 
05:07:21.590 --> 05:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
or drive to school because they're 17. I
 
05:07:24.110 --> 05:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know I I don't know Mr chair to
 
05:07:25.910 --> 05:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
be completely honest well that's what I
 
05:07:29.090 --> 05:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
want yeah I I yeah I don't we don't I
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't think we see children who are not
 
05:07:33.590 --> 05:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know allowed to do things that are
 
05:07:35.930 --> 05:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
developmentally appropriate and so but
 
05:07:38.890 --> 05:07:38.900 align:start position:0%
again I I really have no data on that so
 
05:07:40.850 --> 05:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
05:07:42.770 --> 05:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:07:44.930 --> 05:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
for speaking to us about this one
 
05:07:47.390 --> 05:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
um I know that other states have minimum
 
05:07:47.400 --> 05:07:48.770 align:start position:0%
um I know that other states have minimum
ages

05:07:48.770 --> 05:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
ages
 
05:07:50.868 --> 05:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
um for kids to do some of these things
 
05:07:53.570 --> 05:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
like Illinois for example wants kids to
 
05:07:56.090 --> 05:07:56.100 align:start position:0%
be like 13 before they're allowed to
 
05:07:59.150 --> 05:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
stay home alone does New Hampshire have
 
05:08:01.910 --> 05:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
any guidelines regarding ages for kids
 
05:08:05.750 --> 05:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
to stay home alone one and two when dcyf
 
05:08:08.628 --> 05:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
receives a report of say an unintended
 
05:08:11.270 --> 05:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
child what does the caseworker usually
 
05:08:13.368 --> 05:08:13.378 align:start position:0%
assess for when deciding whether or not
 
05:08:15.890 --> 05:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
it meets the statute I I'm not aware
 
05:08:17.750 --> 05:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has minimum wages for
 
05:08:19.730 --> 05:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
anything taking your first question uh
 
05:08:22.550 --> 05:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
first uh as to the second question if we
 
05:08:25.310 --> 05:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
had if there was an assessment for an
 
05:08:26.750 --> 05:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
unattended child we would certainly look
 
05:08:28.670 --> 05:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
to the age the maturity the
 
05:08:31.128 --> 05:08:31.138 align:start position:0%
circumstances was the child left is the
 
05:08:33.590 --> 05:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
child 12 left in a car while the parent
 
05:08:36.410 --> 05:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
ran in to get milk or something and the
 
05:08:40.510 --> 05:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:44.270 --> 05:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
representative Levesque
 
05:08:48.170 --> 05:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:49.850 --> 05:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
do you
 
05:08:53.330 --> 05:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
potentially see a problem with
 
05:08:58.490 --> 05:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
it being so vague on uh line 19 into 20
 
05:09:00.590 --> 05:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
where it says remaining in a vehicle
 
05:09:02.930 --> 05:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
unattended especially when we've seen
 
05:09:05.868 --> 05:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
like increases of
 
05:09:09.530 --> 05:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
over social media of people frantically
 
05:09:12.830 --> 05:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
trying to save children on hot Vehicles
 
05:09:14.628 --> 05:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
during the summer trying to break into
 
05:09:16.128 --> 05:09:16.138 align:start position:0%
them police trying to break into
 
05:09:18.410 --> 05:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
Vehicles do you see a problem with that
 
05:09:21.948 --> 05:09:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:24.708 --> 05:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
I I think in general the language is
 
05:09:26.690 --> 05:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
problematic although well-intended I
 
05:09:28.190 --> 05:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
think just because
 
05:09:31.910 --> 05:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
um again our our investigations are so
 
05:09:34.190 --> 05:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
fact and case specific
 
05:09:36.230 --> 05:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
um uh you know I think that if for some
 
05:09:38.390 --> 05:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
reason this was in our neglect statute
 
05:09:41.090 --> 05:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
we would certainly again look to what
 
05:09:42.590 --> 05:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond said we would
 
05:09:45.910 --> 05:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
look to the circumstances uh uh
 
05:09:48.288 --> 05:09:48.298 align:start position:0%
surrounding the child remaining
 
05:09:50.690 --> 05:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
unattended in the in the uh in the
 
05:09:50.700 --> 05:09:54.288 align:start position:0%
unattended in the in the uh in the
vehicle

05:09:54.288 --> 05:09:54.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:55.910 --> 05:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that addresses your
 
05:09:58.010 --> 05:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
question so
 
05:09:59.750 --> 05:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
no question
 
05:10:01.250 --> 05:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
you just
 
05:10:03.708 --> 05:10:03.718 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford uh thank you Mr
 
05:10:03.718 --> 05:10:05.030 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford uh thank you Mr
chairman

05:10:05.030 --> 05:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:10:07.550 --> 05:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
um I see this is more as language that
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
parents are looking for to give them
 
05:10:11.810 --> 05:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
guidance as to what they may or may not
 
05:10:13.910 --> 05:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
do right now they're in kind of a flux
 
05:10:16.070 --> 05:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
as to when they can leave their child
 
05:10:18.530 --> 05:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
unattended or go for a ride on the
 
05:10:20.810 --> 05:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
bicycle and such I I know times have
 
05:10:22.010 --> 05:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
changed somewhat
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
I know uh I know when I was a kid which
 
05:10:26.510 --> 05:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
is just a little while ago
 
05:10:29.390 --> 05:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
I uh we we thought I think of jumping on
 
05:10:31.430 --> 05:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
our bicycles at you know nine years old
 
05:10:32.930 --> 05:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
and going a mile down the road because I
 
05:10:34.850 --> 05:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
lived in a rural area or two miles down
 
05:10:36.590 --> 05:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
the road to visit a friend
 
05:10:38.708 --> 05:10:38.718 align:start position:0%
but today you don't see too much of that
 
05:10:42.110 --> 05:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh anymore I I know my favorite show is
 
05:10:44.810 --> 05:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
uh Mary Berry RFD one of my favorite
 
05:10:47.628 --> 05:10:47.638 align:start position:0%
shows anyway and you see Opie going off
 
05:10:49.310 --> 05:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
and doing things with his with his
 
05:10:50.448 --> 05:10:50.458 align:start position:0%
friends and
 
05:10:53.150 --> 05:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
and uh so I think parents are looking
 
05:10:54.590 --> 05:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
for some Direction
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
and this might be something that might
 
05:10:59.868 --> 05:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
be helpful in that that way
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
I I don't know uh sorry I I can't I
 
05:11:05.270 --> 05:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
can't presume to speak for parents in
 
05:11:08.030 --> 05:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so uh you know I mean we
 
05:11:10.910 --> 05:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
we sort of I mean there was uh there's a
 
05:11:12.770 --> 05:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
scene in the movie E.T about Elliot
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
being left home alone when he was nine
 
05:11:16.550 --> 05:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
years old and so we were discussing this
 
05:11:18.948 --> 05:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
like you know is that really problematic
 
05:11:21.170 --> 05:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
you know it's the E.T Elliott kind of
 
05:11:23.750 --> 05:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
question but um you know I think that
 
05:11:26.448 --> 05:11:26.458 align:start position:0%
it's it's up to parents discretion
 
05:11:30.530 --> 05:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
um and but I again I I just cannot speak
 
05:11:33.110 --> 05:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
to what parents need in terms of uh
 
05:11:34.910 --> 05:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
Direction I saw the movie Home Alone
 
05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
yeah well that probably would be
 
05:11:37.680 --> 05:11:40.270 align:start position:0%
yeah well that probably would be
problematic

05:11:40.270 --> 05:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:43.010 --> 05:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
so that was a mistake so little children
 
05:11:46.010 --> 05:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
going to the fishing hole as in Mayberry
 
05:11:48.650 --> 05:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
RFD is anybody asserting we have an OP
 
05:11:50.510 --> 05:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
crisis in this state
 
05:11:55.368 --> 05:11:55.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:57.550 --> 05:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
anyone else yeah
 
05:12:00.830 --> 05:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman
 
05:12:04.730 --> 05:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:12:06.890 --> 05:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
I wish that the representative who
 
05:12:09.470 --> 05:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
presented who offered up this bill would
 
05:12:11.208 --> 05:12:11.218 align:start position:0%
be here to answer questions because I'm
 
05:12:13.550 --> 05:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
confused about
 
05:12:19.128 --> 05:12:19.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
related to
 
05:12:26.288 --> 05:12:26.298 align:start position:0%
spiritual means Church good faith I mean
 
05:12:29.628 --> 05:12:29.638 align:start position:0%
that that is that's current law that is
 
05:12:29.638 --> 05:12:31.628 align:start position:0%
that that is that's current law that is
yeah

05:12:31.628 --> 05:12:31.638 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:12:36.650 --> 05:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:39.288 --> 05:12:39.298 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
05:12:41.690 --> 05:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
this side of the room take take note of
 
05:12:43.510 --> 05:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
this okay all right thank you
 
05:12:46.430 --> 05:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
representative ball
 
05:12:47.750 --> 05:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
05:12:49.310 --> 05:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:12:51.770 --> 05:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
um in reading this myself as a person
 
05:12:55.430 --> 05:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
who apparently is a free-range child
 
05:12:58.128 --> 05:12:58.138 align:start position:0%
um or was raised a free-range child it
 
05:13:00.530 --> 05:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
seems to be a societal change because
 
05:13:03.230 --> 05:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
when I look at these activities this is
 
05:13:06.770 --> 05:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
exactly what I did when I was eight nine
 
05:13:09.050 --> 05:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
ten years old and it was always my
 
05:13:11.090 --> 05:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
understanding and correct me if I'm
 
05:13:13.610 --> 05:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
wrong please this would be my question
 
05:13:16.010 --> 05:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
um is that age seven is the Age of
 
05:13:18.050 --> 05:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
Reason which is why we allow children to
 
05:13:20.330 --> 05:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
walk to school when they're seven in the
 
05:13:23.708 --> 05:13:23.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:26.868 --> 05:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
and there's also statue there are also
 
05:13:29.810 --> 05:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
guidelines for um babysitting as to when
 
05:13:31.250 --> 05:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
you can leave your child
 
05:13:32.570 --> 05:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
um home alone and when they can take
 
05:13:34.788 --> 05:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
care of another person's child so there
 
05:13:36.948 --> 05:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
are statues but yes that's why children
 
05:13:39.230 --> 05:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
are not all bossed we do have walkers
 
05:13:42.350 --> 05:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
that go to elementary school
 
05:13:47.708 --> 05:13:47.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:50.810 --> 05:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:13:53.208 --> 05:13:53.218 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
05:13:56.330 --> 05:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
very much in consultation with the vice
 
05:13:56.340 --> 05:13:57.530 align:start position:0%
very much in consultation with the vice
chairman

05:13:57.530 --> 05:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:14:00.190 --> 05:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
slash ranking member
 
05:14:03.288 --> 05:14:03.298 align:start position:0%
we are wondering
 
05:14:05.030 --> 05:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
if we are ready
 
05:14:08.690 --> 05:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:10.730 --> 05:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
think so everybody think we've all come
 
05:14:13.730 --> 05:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
to a conclusion pretty much and it's the
 
05:14:15.470 --> 05:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
same conclusion
 
05:14:17.448 --> 05:14:17.458 align:start position:0%
uh we're getting good at this one you
 
05:14:17.458 --> 05:14:18.410 align:start position:0%
uh we're getting good at this one you
know

05:14:18.410 --> 05:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:14:20.750 --> 05:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
so I will close the hearing on House
 
05:14:24.050 --> 05:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
Bill 490 and open the exact session on
 
05:14:27.350 --> 05:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 490 and the chair is looking
 
05:14:33.310 --> 05:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:35.810 --> 05:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman I withdraw my
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
previous comment it does not have to be
 
05:14:40.070 --> 05:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
in German when you write the blurb
 
05:14:42.948 --> 05:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
I mean I'll make a motion
 
05:14:48.650 --> 05:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
um for uh to move 490 itl 490 itl moved
 
05:14:50.690 --> 05:14:50.700 align:start position:0%
by representative Grossman who is the
 
05:14:53.390 --> 05:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
second representative Nelson we will
 
05:14:59.330 --> 05:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:59.340 --> 05:15:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

05:15:01.990 --> 05:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
05:15:04.850 --> 05:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone
 
05:15:06.650 --> 05:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:15:09.490 --> 05:15:09.500 align:start position:0%
um it seems I was a free-range parent
 
05:15:13.250 --> 05:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
and when my children got
 
05:15:15.830 --> 05:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
old enough I actually called the state
 
05:15:18.890 --> 05:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
and said if I let my child do this at
 
05:15:20.270 --> 05:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
this age
 
05:15:23.150 --> 05:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
and this not at that age
 
05:15:26.570 --> 05:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
am I neglecting my children and they
 
05:15:29.810 --> 05:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
said I was told and I don't remember who
 
05:15:32.090 --> 05:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
it was
 
05:15:35.930 --> 05:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
um if you as a parent feel that your
 
05:15:38.270 --> 05:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
child children can make those choices
 
05:15:41.570 --> 05:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
and are mature enough then you as a
 
05:15:44.510 --> 05:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
parent make that choice now the only one
 
05:15:46.490 --> 05:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
I ever had
 
05:15:49.670 --> 05:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
so my children were
 
05:15:52.250 --> 05:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
on the weekends
 
05:15:54.770 --> 05:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
yet they were allowed
 
05:15:56.930 --> 05:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
after they got offing and did their
 
05:15:59.150 --> 05:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
chores and had their breakfast go
 
05:16:00.650 --> 05:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
outside and play and don't come back to
 
05:16:00.660 --> 05:16:02.150 align:start position:0%
outside and play and don't come back to
lunch

05:16:02.150 --> 05:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
05:16:04.550 --> 05:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
and then at lunch if they weren't fed
 
05:16:07.070 --> 05:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
outside they were fed inside go outside
 
05:16:09.470 --> 05:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
and play and don't come back until the
 
05:16:11.990 --> 05:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
street lights were on come on and the
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
only one that ever said anything about
 
05:16:16.670 --> 05:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
that was my granddaughter who said Nan
 
05:16:20.270 --> 05:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
you was so harsh foreign
 
05:16:20.280 --> 05:16:21.530 align:start position:0%
you was so harsh foreign
but

05:16:21.530 --> 05:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:16:24.470 --> 05:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
I I never had an issue with being
 
05:16:26.990 --> 05:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
charged with neglect or whatever my I I
 
05:16:30.410 --> 05:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
kind of knew where my kids were
 
05:16:31.788 --> 05:16:31.798 align:start position:0%
um they were right in town and they did
 
05:16:33.948 --> 05:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
ride their bikes maybe a mile or
 
05:16:37.490 --> 05:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
whatever i i s I agree that this is a
 
05:16:40.430 --> 05:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
bill it's looking for a problem and
 
05:16:40.440 --> 05:16:41.628 align:start position:0%
bill it's looking for a problem and
there

05:16:41.628 --> 05:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:16:45.230 --> 05:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
parent most parents can make educated
 
05:16:49.310 --> 05:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
choices depending upon their child
 
05:16:51.650 --> 05:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
now I should not have been left to run
 
05:16:54.670 --> 05:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
free but my children were just fine
 
05:16:59.288 --> 05:16:59.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:01.490 --> 05:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative Levesque
 
05:17:04.730 --> 05:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative DeSimone you
 
05:17:07.550 --> 05:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of schools where it's
 
05:17:11.330 --> 05:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
easily walkable for students me I went
 
05:17:12.948 --> 05:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
to a high school that was in another
 
05:17:15.830 --> 05:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
town and I had to drive there but I
 
05:17:18.530 --> 05:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
would see students walking to there and
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
many of them were between the ages of 14
 
05:17:24.830 --> 05:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
to 18 and that was perfectly okay
 
05:17:26.930 --> 05:17:26.940 align:start position:0%
because their houses were just down the
 
05:17:29.810 --> 05:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
street you know me on the other hand I
 
05:17:31.970 --> 05:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
don't think it'd be safe to walk down a
 
05:17:34.448 --> 05:17:34.458 align:start position:0%
highway or two to get to high school but
 
05:17:37.448 --> 05:17:37.458 align:start position:0%
125 yes
 
05:17:42.110 --> 05:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
Route 4 and 125 yeah oh
 
05:17:44.628 --> 05:17:44.638 align:start position:0%
um but I think that a lot of parents
 
05:17:47.390 --> 05:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
know what they
 
05:17:49.910 --> 05:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
their children are capable of doing at
 
05:17:53.510 --> 05:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
certain ages you know uh they switch
 
05:17:55.970 --> 05:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
their car seats from facing backwards
 
05:17:58.190 --> 05:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
different words after a certain age
 
05:18:00.650 --> 05:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
because of safety reasons but
 
05:18:02.810 --> 05:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
you know I don't think that
 
05:18:06.590 --> 05:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
having such a vague law to dictate oh
 
05:18:08.750 --> 05:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
this is child abuse because they're
 
05:18:10.730 --> 05:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
riding their bikes to their friends you
 
05:18:12.590 --> 05:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
know it's
 
05:18:14.690 --> 05:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
they're going to a friends most of the
 
05:18:17.208 --> 05:18:17.218 align:start position:0%
parents know that friends they talk to
 
05:18:18.830 --> 05:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
their parents they get to know their
 
05:18:22.430 --> 05:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
parents you know they intermingle and I
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
think that a lot of parents know what's
 
05:18:26.390 --> 05:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
best for their children uh
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to like hey you
 
05:18:30.770 --> 05:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
can go over to little Susie's house
 
05:18:33.890 --> 05:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
which is down the street
 
05:18:35.810 --> 05:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
and if they were doing something really
 
05:18:35.820 --> 05:18:36.830 align:start position:0%
and if they were doing something really
wrong

05:18:36.830 --> 05:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
05:18:41.030 --> 05:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
a good faith complaint could be filed
 
05:18:44.030 --> 05:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
see previous bill yeah yeah
 
05:18:47.090 --> 05:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative Raymond waves
 
05:18:49.310 --> 05:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
off are you waving off for you no I'd
 
05:18:50.810 --> 05:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
like to see you waving at me okay yes
 
05:18:53.150 --> 05:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative Wayman Raymond Raymond
 
05:18:55.190 --> 05:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
sorry I try and like lean forward and
 
05:18:56.930 --> 05:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
catch your attention because I'm in like
 
05:18:59.390 --> 05:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
the blind Corner your sincerity is much
 
05:19:01.670 --> 05:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
appreciated thank you thank you um thank
 
05:19:04.190 --> 05:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
you for letting me speak I think that it
 
05:19:06.230 --> 05:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
sounds based on the nods and the smiles
 
05:19:07.550 --> 05:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing around this table it sounds
 
05:19:10.368 --> 05:19:10.378 align:start position:0%
like we're pretty much in agreement as
 
05:19:12.110 --> 05:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
um a committee and I just think that's
 
05:19:12.120 --> 05:19:13.430 align:start position:0%
um a committee and I just think that's
fantastic

05:19:13.430 --> 05:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
fantastic
 
05:19:17.208 --> 05:19:17.218 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire has a great system of
 
05:19:19.550 --> 05:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
um really trusting our families and our
 
05:19:22.128 --> 05:19:22.138 align:start position:0%
kids to really generally do the right
 
05:19:23.930 --> 05:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
thing I do think there are situations
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
where we've got you know two and
 
05:19:26.868 --> 05:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
three-year-olds who shouldn't be left
 
05:19:28.550 --> 05:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
home alone and those parents need some
 
05:19:31.070 --> 05:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
education but that's kind of what dcyf
 
05:19:32.810 --> 05:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
is for it's why they send social workers
 
05:19:36.288 --> 05:19:36.298 align:start position:0%
out to help families when they have made
 
05:19:39.948 --> 05:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
a misstep this this language I don't
 
05:19:39.958 --> 05:19:41.230 align:start position:0%
a misstep this this language I don't
think

05:19:41.230 --> 05:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:19:43.730 --> 05:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
adds anything
 
05:19:45.890 --> 05:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
um to state law that isn't there nor
 
05:19:48.110 --> 05:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
will I think it nor do I think it will
 
05:19:50.990 --> 05:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
change the practice of many families
 
05:19:54.110 --> 05:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
um or our dcif workers so I don't see
 
05:19:55.670 --> 05:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
that it is helpful
 
05:19:56.750 --> 05:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:20:01.910 --> 05:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:04.190 --> 05:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
 
05:20:04.200 --> 05:20:05.208 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
chairman

05:20:05.208 --> 05:20:05.218 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:20:07.550 --> 05:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
um I actually like this amendment for
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
the reasons what uh representative
 
05:20:11.750 --> 05:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
Bickford had mentioned before that it
 
05:20:11.760 --> 05:20:13.010 align:start position:0%
Bickford had mentioned before that it
might

05:20:13.010 --> 05:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
might
 
05:20:17.930 --> 05:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
provide guidance for parents whether
 
05:20:21.288 --> 05:20:21.298 align:start position:0%
you know whether they know that they can
 
05:20:24.410 --> 05:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
allow these activities because I too
 
05:20:27.530 --> 05:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
like representative DeSimone have looked
 
05:20:29.690 --> 05:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
up like what can I allow like my child
 
05:20:31.670 --> 05:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
to do at what age you know how old does
 
05:20:33.530 --> 05:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
my child have to be to be home alone
 
05:20:35.930 --> 05:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
type of type of things I've had I've had
 
05:20:37.970 --> 05:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
I've looked those up as well and so by
 
05:20:40.128 --> 05:20:40.138 align:start position:0%
giving the parents
 
05:20:43.310 --> 05:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
um guidance uh I think that's helpful
 
05:20:45.650 --> 05:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
also I think it's helpful for people in
 
05:20:49.310 --> 05:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
the community to know that you know this
 
05:20:52.430 --> 05:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
parent is not being neglectful that you
 
05:20:54.770 --> 05:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
know you see their kid outside and the
 
05:20:57.470 --> 05:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
parents inside you know and and the kid
 
05:20:59.150 --> 05:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
is just playing and riding their bike
 
05:21:02.150 --> 05:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
around around town like they're not
 
05:21:04.430 --> 05:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
doing anything wrong
 
05:21:07.128 --> 05:21:07.138 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that the intent of
 
05:21:10.610 --> 05:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
this bill would be to to drive down the
 
05:21:15.830 --> 05:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
number of calls to dcyf that you know so
 
05:21:18.110 --> 05:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
and so in my town is you know not
 
05:21:20.208 --> 05:21:20.218 align:start position:0%
watching their child because you know I
 
05:21:21.530 --> 05:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
always see the child around without the
 
05:21:21.540 --> 05:21:23.030 align:start position:0%
always see the child around without the
parent

05:21:23.030 --> 05:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
parent
 
05:21:26.690 --> 05:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
um and those types of calls happen so I
 
05:21:28.310 --> 05:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
think that there's actually good intent
 
05:21:31.368 --> 05:21:31.378 align:start position:0%
behind this language the only thing that
 
05:21:35.030 --> 05:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
I see a problem with is the remaining in
 
05:21:38.030 --> 05:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
the vehicle unattended because of the
 
05:21:39.530 --> 05:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
hot weather
 
05:21:39.540 --> 05:21:40.850 align:start position:0%
hot weather
um

05:21:40.850 --> 05:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:43.970 --> 05:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
I would like to see that little furries
 
05:21:47.810 --> 05:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
taken out but all the rest of it I don't
 
05:21:51.170 --> 05:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:53.330 --> 05:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
05:21:55.610 --> 05:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman the problem I see
 
05:21:59.868 --> 05:21:59.878 align:start position:0%
with this being put in in uh statute is
 
05:22:02.510 --> 05:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
if a mature child is writing to their
 
05:22:04.550 --> 05:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
friend's house and something happens to
 
05:22:04.560 --> 05:22:05.330 align:start position:0%
friend's house and something happens to
them

05:22:05.330 --> 05:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:22:07.850 --> 05:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
do we go after the parent because they
 
05:22:10.190 --> 05:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
allow them to do that
 
05:22:11.990 --> 05:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
so when you put something in a statue
 
05:22:14.628 --> 05:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
saying that that is allowed and
 
05:22:17.090 --> 05:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
something happens to the child I mean
 
05:22:19.010 --> 05:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
every child is different
 
05:22:21.948 --> 05:22:21.958 align:start position:0%
every parent's flexibility with what
 
05:22:24.350 --> 05:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
they'll allow their child to do is
 
05:22:26.570 --> 05:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
different and that's the way I think it
 
05:22:29.650 --> 05:22:29.660 align:start position:0%
should remain the way uh
 
05:22:33.410 --> 05:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
marginson uh related first of all she
 
05:22:36.170 --> 05:22:36.180 align:start position:0%
said there is no issue currently with
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
with this so why so putting this in I
 
05:22:42.830 --> 05:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
believe would make it an issue
 
05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
my comment would be that if if we went
 
05:22:47.930 --> 05:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
with this new language I don't know if
 
05:22:50.390 --> 05:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
it would cut down the calls to dcyf
 
05:22:51.650 --> 05:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
because I don't know how many people
 
05:22:54.410 --> 05:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
read the rsas of New Hampshire
 
05:22:56.208 --> 05:22:56.218 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:22:59.330 --> 05:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
so I mean what difference would it make
 
05:23:03.590 --> 05:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else yes representative Nelson I
 
05:23:05.570 --> 05:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
think that we don't even need to
 
05:23:08.330 --> 05:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
speculate about the intent of this bill
 
05:23:10.970 --> 05:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
because the sponsor isn't here
 
05:23:13.610 --> 05:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
so I don't feel like we even need to be
 
05:23:15.708 --> 05:23:15.718 align:start position:0%
wasting our time speculating because we
 
05:23:20.448 --> 05:23:20.458 align:start position:0%
don't know why the sponsor desired to
 
05:23:23.208 --> 05:23:23.218 align:start position:0%
write this Bill thank you except when
 
05:23:25.070 --> 05:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
the sponsor is not here we can speculate
 
05:23:27.650 --> 05:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
all we want and get away with it
 
05:23:30.410 --> 05:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
maybe that's not good though
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:40.730 --> 05:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
excuse me I wouldn't I wouldn't go there
 
05:23:42.530 --> 05:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
with a sponsor issue because he you know
 
05:23:44.570 --> 05:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
he may have covid for all we know and
 
05:23:46.610 --> 05:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
it's not opposition now but
 
05:23:48.590 --> 05:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton brings up a good
 
05:23:51.050 --> 05:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
point and and I agree totally with this
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm going with it is this
 
05:23:55.730 --> 05:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
will help limit
 
05:23:57.890 --> 05:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
reports and then we just heard her bill
 
05:24:00.250 --> 05:24:00.260 align:start position:0%
about how many reports that they get
 
05:24:04.368 --> 05:24:04.378 align:start position:0%
and uh people wanting to go maliciously
 
05:24:07.430 --> 05:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
to prosecute people that may be doing
 
05:24:09.050 --> 05:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
false reporting
 
05:24:11.628 --> 05:24:11.638 align:start position:0%
and they do get a lot of reports right
 
05:24:14.330 --> 05:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
now people have to guess whether it's
 
05:24:16.970 --> 05:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
okay to do that or not
 
05:24:19.850 --> 05:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
um representative Simoni
 
05:24:22.850 --> 05:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
call dcyf represent Bolton called dcyf
 
05:24:24.410 --> 05:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
to get an opinion
 
05:24:26.690 --> 05:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
we should have it in Statue and whether
 
05:24:27.770 --> 05:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
they read it or not it doesn't matter
 
05:24:29.448 --> 05:24:29.458 align:start position:0%
the word will get out from the statue
 
05:24:31.610 --> 05:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
it's in writing now it's not somebody's
 
05:24:33.948 --> 05:24:33.958 align:start position:0%
opinion over at dcyf then somebody else
 
05:24:34.970 --> 05:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
is going to have a different opinion
 
05:24:38.390 --> 05:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
maybe this is clear and the word I like
 
05:24:40.250 --> 05:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
the most here is the word maturity and
 
05:24:43.070 --> 05:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
we do lose that in child law uh family
 
05:24:43.080 --> 05:24:44.690 align:start position:0%
we do lose that in child law uh family
law

05:24:44.690 --> 05:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:24:47.750 --> 05:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
um the word what maturity maturity when
 
05:24:50.510 --> 05:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
you go to court the court uses it too
 
05:24:54.288 --> 05:24:54.298 align:start position:0%
for uh a child to be able to testify
 
05:24:56.270 --> 05:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
depends on the maturity
 
05:24:58.368 --> 05:24:58.378 align:start position:0%
um when we talk about
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
slipped my mind now there's something
 
05:25:02.448 --> 05:25:02.458 align:start position:0%
else so but maturity is a key word here
 
05:25:04.850 --> 05:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
and yes as representative long says well
 
05:25:06.650 --> 05:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
it's somebody else's interpretation of
 
05:25:08.330 --> 05:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
that interpretation
 
05:25:10.070 --> 05:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
but we should put it out there that this
 
05:25:13.490 --> 05:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
is our our our
 
05:25:16.910 --> 05:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
line that we're using that 11 year old
 
05:25:18.948 --> 05:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
sometimes very mature that's the thing
 
05:25:21.050 --> 05:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
that dcyf would make the decisions on
 
05:25:23.750 --> 05:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
whether they're immature or not and the
 
05:25:26.510 --> 05:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
parents need to from now on
 
05:25:30.410 --> 05:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
keep track of that child more closely
 
05:25:32.390 --> 05:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
so that's why I'm I'm going to go with
 
05:25:34.070 --> 05:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
it regardless of whether it's sponsors
 
05:25:37.070 --> 05:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
here or not representative uh
 
05:25:37.080 --> 05:25:39.230 align:start position:0%
here or not representative uh
Petrino

05:25:39.230 --> 05:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
Petrino
 
05:25:41.090 --> 05:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:25:43.010 --> 05:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
um respectfully I'm really not concerned
 
05:25:46.010 --> 05:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
with how many calls dcyf gets I think in
 
05:25:48.410 --> 05:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
every instance we must air
 
05:25:50.750 --> 05:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
um on the side of the child
 
05:25:54.350 --> 05:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
um that I think is Paramount and for the
 
05:25:56.990 --> 05:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
most part I think parents make
 
05:25:58.990 --> 05:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
Common Sense decisions
 
05:26:02.510 --> 05:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
and most of us know when there is in
 
05:26:05.570 --> 05:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
fact neglect or when parents are just
 
05:26:07.910 --> 05:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
simply letting kids be kids and walk to
 
05:26:10.310 --> 05:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
school and ride their bicycles I'm
 
05:26:11.810 --> 05:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
sitting here thinking of just one
 
05:26:15.970 --> 05:26:15.980 align:start position:0%
instance that I observed of a mom who
 
05:26:18.530 --> 05:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
basically in my view abandoned her child
 
05:26:21.110 --> 05:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
let the child sit on a sidewalk while
 
05:26:23.990 --> 05:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
she decided to go rollerblading then I
 
05:26:25.850 --> 05:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
came out of a shop
 
05:26:27.650 --> 05:26:27.660 align:start position:0%
and I saw this child sitting there
 
05:26:30.590 --> 05:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
crying and I I asked what's what's wrong
 
05:26:33.948 --> 05:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
my mom is gone and so I called the
 
05:26:36.530 --> 05:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
police and after about 10 minutes here
 
05:26:39.470 --> 05:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
came mom on her rollerblade just leaving
 
05:26:41.750 --> 05:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
that child on the sidewalk clearly
 
05:26:45.350 --> 05:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's abusive and so the bottom line is
 
05:26:47.090 --> 05:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
this I think we know when children are
 
05:26:48.590 --> 05:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
neglected and when parents are just
 
05:26:50.868 --> 05:26:50.878 align:start position:0%
being good parents and whenever there's
 
05:26:53.930 --> 05:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
any doubt always air with caution on the
 
05:26:55.730 --> 05:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
side of the child
 
05:26:55.740 --> 05:27:00.288 align:start position:0%
side of the child
foreign

05:27:00.288 --> 05:27:00.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:02.690 --> 05:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you for
 
05:27:04.788 --> 05:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
your Indulgence Mr chairman uh just one
 
05:27:07.850 --> 05:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
final thought on on this and the word
 
05:27:09.770 --> 05:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
maturity because I do think that that is
 
05:27:11.390 --> 05:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
a key here
 
05:27:11.400 --> 05:27:12.250 align:start position:0%
a key here
um

05:27:12.250 --> 05:27:12.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:15.830 --> 05:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
there are situations where it might be
 
05:27:18.890 --> 05:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
safer for me to expect my 12 year old to
 
05:27:21.708 --> 05:27:21.718 align:start position:0%
walk to school then for my 15 year old
 
05:27:23.750 --> 05:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
or 16 year old because I know the 12
 
05:27:25.310 --> 05:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
year old is motivated and is going to
 
05:27:27.230 --> 05:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
make it to school whereas my 15 or 16
 
05:27:28.310 --> 05:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
year old is going to take the
 
05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to skip for the day so you
 
05:27:34.610 --> 05:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
know it's important for us to allow
 
05:27:34.620 --> 05:27:36.170 align:start position:0%
know it's important for us to allow
parents

05:27:36.170 --> 05:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
parents
 
05:27:39.470 --> 05:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
to make these kinds of decisions for
 
05:27:42.230 --> 05:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
themselves without saying well there you
 
05:27:44.090 --> 05:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
know if the child is old enough by age
 
05:27:45.890 --> 05:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
and old enough by maturity well you may
 
05:27:47.208 --> 05:27:47.218 align:start position:0%
not know that your kid's not mature
 
05:27:48.948 --> 05:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
enough to handle something until you
 
05:27:50.810 --> 05:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
give them that responsibility and they
 
05:27:52.730 --> 05:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
fail to follow through that's part of
 
05:27:54.470 --> 05:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
like the learning and growing of normal
 
05:27:56.390 --> 05:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
child development
 
05:27:59.510 --> 05:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
um so I hesitate to put exceptions in
 
05:28:02.270 --> 05:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
the neglect law
 
05:28:04.670 --> 05:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
um because each child is so unique in
 
05:28:06.830 --> 05:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
each family situation is so unique and I
 
05:28:08.750 --> 05:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
just you know there are some families
 
05:28:11.150 --> 05:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
where you could leave teenagers home for
 
05:28:13.310 --> 05:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
a weekend and it would be fine they
 
05:28:14.570 --> 05:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
might have a friend over they're not
 
05:28:16.128 --> 05:28:16.138 align:start position:0%
going to have a raging party but there
 
05:28:19.368 --> 05:28:19.378 align:start position:0%
are other teenagers the same age who you
 
05:28:21.650 --> 05:28:21.660 align:start position:0%
could not trust to be alone overnight
 
05:28:23.390 --> 05:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
because they're going to make poor
 
05:28:26.510 --> 05:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
decisions and I I think that we need to
 
05:28:31.070 --> 05:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
trust parents to engage in that type of
 
05:28:33.490 --> 05:28:33.500 align:start position:0%
thinking as opposed to
 
05:28:37.310 --> 05:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
asking dcif or putting in statute what
 
05:28:39.110 --> 05:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
are what the standards are I mean we
 
05:28:41.448 --> 05:28:41.458 align:start position:0%
need to help parents do some of this
 
05:28:44.570 --> 05:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
parenting work so would you then be for
 
05:28:46.368 --> 05:28:46.378 align:start position:0%
the bill or not for the Bill I'm not for
 
05:28:49.490 --> 05:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
the bill because I think I I mean I I as
 
05:28:51.288 --> 05:28:51.298 align:start position:0%
you know I used to work for tcyf I went
 
05:28:53.510 --> 05:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
out one summer to a nine-year-old who
 
05:28:55.190 --> 05:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
was home alone while the parents worked
 
05:28:57.770 --> 05:28:57.780 align:start position:0%
full-time they were not scared they had
 
05:29:00.530 --> 05:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
a big dog like they were totally
 
05:29:02.570 --> 05:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
comfortable they had a plan what to do
 
05:29:04.250 --> 05:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
if someone came to the door what to do
 
05:29:06.590 --> 05:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
if there was a fire what like they had
 
05:29:08.810 --> 05:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
it nailed you know and I've been out to
 
05:29:10.970 --> 05:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
15 year olds who you know I wouldn't
 
05:29:13.610 --> 05:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
trust them to watch a goldfish so it
 
05:29:18.110 --> 05:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
really depends on the individual family
 
05:29:20.510 --> 05:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
and what's going on with that child's
 
05:29:22.310 --> 05:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
development and where they are you know
 
05:29:23.868 --> 05:29:23.878 align:start position:0%
mental health-wise and if they're having
 
05:29:25.670 --> 05:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
a good day there's just so many factors
 
05:29:25.680 --> 05:29:27.350 align:start position:0%
a good day there's just so many factors
and

05:29:27.350 --> 05:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:29:30.350 --> 05:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
um I hate to boil it down to like one
 
05:29:32.030 --> 05:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
long sentence that would say that this
 
05:29:34.250 --> 05:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
is okay and you know in all
 
05:29:35.570 --> 05:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
circumstances if you have a kid who's
 
05:29:37.910 --> 05:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
old enough and mature enough we do have
 
05:29:39.948 --> 05:29:39.958 align:start position:0%
another bill coming up are we about
 
05:29:42.350 --> 05:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
kicking this one to death done with you
 
05:29:45.470 --> 05:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
think maybe 20 minutes ago call the
 
05:29:47.270 --> 05:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
question the question before us is House
 
05:29:50.770 --> 05:29:50.780 align:start position:0%
Bill 490 an act relative to modifying
 
05:29:53.690 --> 05:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
the definition of neglect
 
05:29:55.850 --> 05:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
the motion is itl moved by
 
05:29:58.490 --> 05:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
representative Grossmont and seconded by
 
05:30:01.010 --> 05:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson would the clerk
 
05:30:03.890 --> 05:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
please call the roll this is an itl so
 
05:30:06.110 --> 05:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
if you are for the bill
 
05:30:09.170 --> 05:30:09.180 align:start position:0%

thank you sir the chair recognizes our
 
05:33:18.948 --> 05:33:18.958 align:start position:0%

05:33:30.410 --> 05:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair Vice chair
 
05:33:31.970 --> 05:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee I
 
05:33:33.470 --> 05:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak on
 
05:33:34.788 --> 05:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:33:36.948 --> 05:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
um to a certain extent we'd love a
 
05:33:40.670 --> 05:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
website but some of the information that
 
05:33:42.470 --> 05:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
is being asked to be tracked here we're
 
05:33:44.570 --> 05:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
not able to track
 
05:33:47.330 --> 05:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
um and uh so we would say that we're
 
05:33:49.610 --> 05:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
probably against the bill
 
05:33:52.788 --> 05:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
um and um for instance the you know
 
05:33:56.150 --> 05:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
children who this is nine three on page
 
05:33:59.150 --> 05:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
two letter L number and percent of such
 
05:34:00.948 --> 05:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
children knew it all their required
 
05:34:02.570 --> 05:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
immunizations by the first day of the
 
05:34:04.070 --> 05:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
school year that is obviously not
 
05:34:06.350 --> 05:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
information that we could actually track
 
05:34:10.850 --> 05:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
and and publish for the public so
 
05:34:12.830 --> 05:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
um but if you want to give us a website
 
05:34:15.230 --> 05:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
for other things we'd be happy for that
 
05:34:17.868 --> 05:34:17.878 align:start position:0%
but and we do actually publish
 
05:34:19.610 --> 05:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
statistics I'm so sorry it's so hard to
 
05:34:22.190 --> 05:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
see over the side we do uh publish
 
05:34:24.350 --> 05:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
statistics related to our abuse and
 
05:34:26.030 --> 05:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
neglect cases on the Department of
 
05:34:28.368 --> 05:34:28.378 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services website
 
05:34:31.610 --> 05:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
currently and we of course would always
 
05:34:33.288 --> 05:34:33.298 align:start position:0%
Endeavor to make that more user friendly
 
05:34:33.298 --> 05:34:34.550 align:start position:0%
Endeavor to make that more user friendly
so

05:34:34.550 --> 05:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:36.350 --> 05:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
so you do have a lot of data and you
 
05:34:38.810 --> 05:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
publish it we do we do and it is
 
05:34:43.910 --> 05:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:46.368 --> 05:34:46.378 align:start position:0%
I have a question under Roman numeral
 
05:34:46.378 --> 05:34:47.390 align:start position:0%
I have a question under Roman numeral
three

05:34:47.390 --> 05:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:34:51.170 --> 05:34:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:54.970 --> 05:34:54.980 align:start position:0%
does and I believe it should be doesn't
 
05:34:58.010 --> 05:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
maintain such a website with at least 99
 
05:34:59.750 --> 05:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
percent uptime
 
05:35:02.810 --> 05:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
the director of dcyf shall be relieved
 
05:35:05.330 --> 05:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
of his or her position and no division
 
05:35:06.590 --> 05:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
of Department of New Hampshire
 
05:35:09.350 --> 05:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
government shall employ retain a
 
05:35:11.390 --> 05:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
contractor in any capacity of the
 
05:35:14.390 --> 05:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
relieved director
 
05:35:15.890 --> 05:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
um I think that might put a little bit
 
05:35:18.170 --> 05:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
of a chill on hiring at your place it
 
05:35:25.930 --> 05:35:25.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:28.910 --> 05:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford uh thank you Mr
 
05:35:31.430 --> 05:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
chairman well that was my question also
 
05:35:33.830 --> 05:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
and I didn't understand what uptime
 
05:35:33.840 --> 05:35:35.150 align:start position:0%
and I didn't understand what uptime
means

05:35:35.150 --> 05:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
means
 
05:35:37.490 --> 05:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
do you know what it means here as we
 
05:35:38.930 --> 05:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
understand it that it's up that it's
 
05:35:40.850 --> 05:35:40.860 align:start position:0%
actually up and available for use as
 
05:35:43.128 --> 05:35:43.138 align:start position:0%
opposed to down yeah oh well so I think
 
05:35:44.750 --> 05:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm not an I.T persons I think if
 
05:35:47.208 --> 05:35:47.218 align:start position:0%
we're to reverse of what the person
 
05:35:49.610 --> 05:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
intended I I think so I think that they
 
05:35:51.890 --> 05:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
probably meant does not maintain such a
 
05:35:53.868 --> 05:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
website yeah I hate to see you get fired
 
05:35:57.230 --> 05:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
for keeping the thing running yes
 
05:35:57.240 --> 05:35:59.868 align:start position:0%
for keeping the thing running yes
okay

05:35:59.868 --> 05:35:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:02.150 --> 05:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
you know for the record I really do like
 
05:36:05.170 --> 05:36:05.180 align:start position:0%
statistics I chair the New Hampshire
 
05:36:07.430 --> 05:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
commission for the deaf and hard of
 
05:36:09.410 --> 05:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
hearing and one of the things that
 
05:36:13.010 --> 05:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
bothers us is there is a pathological
 
05:36:15.708 --> 05:36:15.718 align:start position:0%
fear in this state of actually recording
 
05:36:18.410 --> 05:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
any information and it makes it very
 
05:36:20.990 --> 05:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
difficult for the deaf Community for us
 
05:36:24.530 --> 05:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
to know who what we need where so I do
 
05:36:27.350 --> 05:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
like stats but what I read in this bill
 
05:36:30.010 --> 05:36:30.020 align:start position:0%
is like stats on speed
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
yes statistics do you agree yes
 
05:36:34.670 --> 05:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
statistics are important data is
 
05:36:36.890 --> 05:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
important especially when you're talking
 
05:36:38.810 --> 05:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
about the work that we do it's it's very
 
05:36:42.170 --> 05:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
very important we do publish stats and
 
05:36:44.448 --> 05:36:44.458 align:start position:0%
data we're always looking to improve
 
05:36:47.930 --> 05:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
things we did do a fiscal analysis on
 
05:36:50.030 --> 05:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
this this bill and
 
05:36:51.590 --> 05:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
um we found that actually getting a
 
05:36:53.770 --> 05:36:53.780 align:start position:0%
vendor to do this kind of website
 
05:36:55.970 --> 05:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
assuming everything's included would be
 
05:36:58.670 --> 05:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
about a million dollars and uh it would
 
05:37:00.708 --> 05:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
probably cost a vendor three full-time
 
05:37:03.550 --> 05:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
employment three full-time employees
 
05:37:06.830 --> 05:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
about a year keeping it up about 500 000
 
05:37:10.788 --> 05:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
so but yes I so that is you know the
 
05:37:12.470 --> 05:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis that we did on it but
 
05:37:15.230 --> 05:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
yes we we agree we statistics and data
 
05:37:17.510 --> 05:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
are very important stipulating the
 
05:37:20.030 --> 05:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
purpose of good data is so that one can
 
05:37:22.310 --> 05:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
make good decisions do you believe the
 
05:37:25.430 --> 05:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
department presently collects data in a
 
05:37:28.368 --> 05:37:28.378 align:start position:0%
sufficient way as to forward your
 
05:37:31.010 --> 05:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
program in a good way we do but we're
 
05:37:33.288 --> 05:37:33.298 align:start position:0%
always looking for ways to improve it's
 
05:37:36.050 --> 05:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
a constant Improvement so we get a lot
 
05:37:39.708 --> 05:37:39.718 align:start position:0%
of our data and anecdotal data so my
 
05:37:41.930 --> 05:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
follow-up is so there might be a line
 
05:37:44.690 --> 05:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
item or two in this long list that maybe
 
05:37:47.208 --> 05:37:47.218 align:start position:0%
makes a suggestions man maybe we can do
 
05:37:49.310 --> 05:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
that yes we
 
05:37:51.770 --> 05:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
we would love to have more money to do
 
05:37:54.830 --> 05:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:01.430 --> 05:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:03.410 --> 05:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
all right thank you so much and with
 
05:38:05.868 --> 05:38:05.878 align:start position:0%
that I conclude the hearing on House
 
05:38:09.110 --> 05:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 551 and with that I open the exact
 
05:38:12.770 --> 05:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
session on the same and the chair is
 
05:38:19.610 --> 05:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:21.230 --> 05:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
oh wow
