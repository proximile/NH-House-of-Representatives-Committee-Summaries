morning call the fiscal committee
 
00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
meeting to order of October 18th uh 2024
 
00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 align:start position:0%
and I believe we're going to have the
 
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
us morning
 
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
Governor going to take some things out
 
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
of order as the the governor's uh
 
00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
schedule we'll move to tab seven which
 
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
discuss Governor great well good morning
 
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
everybody always exciting to come to
 
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal kind of a rarity for me so I'm a
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
little nervous
 
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
you guys are more intimidating than CNN
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
no I'm just kidding I don't believe it
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just kidding so what um the and the
 
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
main reason I've I've chosen to come
 
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
here today is as I think most folks know
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh we're really at the end uh our the
 
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
clock has run out as I as I've said many
 
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
times in terms of the use of this arpa
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
money the federal it's a federal clock
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
it all has to be done really effectively
 
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
all these items any additional arpa
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
items through fiscal effectively have to
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
be approved uh today because there's an
 
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
executive councel process there's always
 
00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
some hiccups with the agencies for this
 
00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
and that making sure that we get all the
 
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
the federal eyes dotted and te's crossed
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
so um uh the the clock is really here
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
the main the other main reason I I
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
wanted to come directly is uh there has
 
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
been a a large amount of money that has
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
now been made available um unfortunately
 
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
for the wrong reasons um we the eight
 
00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
items I'd like to talk about today uh
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
account for about about $
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
13.78 million now the source of the
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
funding is the $15 million arpa grant
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
that we had pre previously given I think
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
everyone was very excited to give uh to
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
solution Health uh this was boy going on
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
18 months to two years ago now the money
 
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
has very recently been returned when in
 
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
the very last minute decision the
 
00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
londonairy Town Council voted against uh
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
an a memorandum of understanding that
 
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
would have allowed this critical new
 
00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 align:start position:0%
mental health hospital to move forward I
 
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
think everyone was excited exced about
 
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
that um I don't mind saying I think it
 
00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
was a completely foolish decision by the
 
00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
town of London der it took us all by
 
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
surprise but be that as it may we have
 
00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
$15 million return to us what I've we've
 
00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 align:start position:0%
really tried to do is keep all $15
 
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 align:start position:0%
million in a single item uh for
 
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
efficiency sake but really to address
 
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
mental health I mean that was the
 
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
original purpose of the dollars um as
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
well as address some of the uh uh
 
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
concerns driven not just by uh the
 
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee but by the legislature
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
we tried to hear some of the requests
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
and and items that the legislature had
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
brought up that we pre previously didn't
 
00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:03.879 align:start position:0%
have dollars for so we're just trying to
 
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
be as responsive as we can as quick as
 
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
we can uh to the needs before us so the
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
goal is to redirect as much of that $15
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
million back into mental health um the
 
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
reason we talked about was for more for
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
efficiency purposes
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
um I guess we can just kind of jump
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
right into them if if that's okay so
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
within this item uh what you see before
 
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
you on item a there's really three
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
aspects to item a and and I'll go
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
through them one at a time and of course
 
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
we can take questions so the first piece
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
of item a is a $2 million allocation to
 
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services transitional
 
00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:42.039 align:start position:0%
housing and this is to support the
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
establishment of an 8-bed therapeutic
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
transitional housing program for
 
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
individuals with mental health
 
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
conditions the program assists in that
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
the Department's bigger effort Around
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
Mission zero which as you know is really
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we don't have any
 
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
individuals waiting in our emergency
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
rooms or hospitals awaiting mental
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
let me interrupt you for a moment so to
 
00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:05.879 align:start position:0%
for us to refer to the item looks like
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
24371 thank you sure sorry about that we
 
00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
minute everybody have it all right thank
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
you okay sorry about
 
00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
so this first item again is $2 million
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
for the transitional housing piece
 
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:36.919 align:start position:0%
supporting the Department's effort
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
Around Mission zero in the mental health
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
boarding crisis um what this really does
 
00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
is create eight new beds to move folks
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
out of New Hampshire hospital uh to
 
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
facilities and uh programs that more fit
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
the level of care based on their current
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
needs there's a lot of folks just in New
 
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital unfortunately that
 
00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
don't have a transitional place to go uh
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital is really for the
 
00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
most intense and and immediate acute
 
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
needs of mental health these folks don't
 
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily require that and so
 
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
Contracting with a an an organization
 
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:11.720 align:start position:0%
that currently uh does this kind of work
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
allows that transition moving eight
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
people out of eight more people out of
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital freeing up those
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
eight beds for new incoming patients
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
with more acute
 
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
needs the second piece of item a is
 
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
approximately $3 million to renovate uh
 
00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:30.519 align:start position:0%
the pych the psychiatric residential
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
treatment facility at Hamed hospital
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's the prtf that a lot of people
 
00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:37.959 align:start position:0%
know it by uh the new design at this the
 
00:09:39.389 --> 00:09:39.399 align:start position:0%
center of excellence which we have
 
00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
already established it does not increase
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
the hospital footprint at all uh it will
 
00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
be more open in the common areas provide
 
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
more single bedrooms that are
 
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
therapeutically necessary uh for certain
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
youth with very intensive uh
 
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
psychosocial needs and and complex
 
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
trauma and the item really addresses
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
calls from the community this was a big
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
part part of I think both the community
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
and the legislature we heard it loud and
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
clear we want to keep more kids in state
 
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
right if we can have these acute
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
specialization opportunities where we
 
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
don't have to send kids out of state uh
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
for for more of the intense rarer needs
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
around mental health that's that's a
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
better thing keep them close to home
 
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
this increases uh the bed count from 6
 
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
to 12 and upgrades the beds that we
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
currently have there uh bringing more
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
specialization in so that is is one that
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
I think is a great opportunity uh and
 
00:10:29.069 --> 00:10:29.079 align:start position:0%
again just kind of responding to
 
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
everything everything that we've heard
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
and I think all of our desire is to keep
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
more of our kids closer to home in state
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
with more of those complex
 
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
needs item um the third aspect of item a
 
00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
before you is approximately $2.7 million
 
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
um and that that actually uh finances a
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
variety of smaller um we call them a
 
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
kind of alternative bid items um which
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
were not included in the base bid of the
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh original YDC these are more YDC
 
00:10:58.509 --> 00:10:58.519 align:start position:0%
driven items again responding to
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
legislative concerns we've heard
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
Community concerns we've heard how do we
 
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
increase security how do we reduce
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
Demand on Town Services these dollars
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
are all really directed in that effort
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
um it does everything there's a there's
 
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
a a variety of small uh pieces here but
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
it does everything from um you know
 
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
upgrade the doors uh to the system um uh
 
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
building out the crisis stabilization
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
unit right for those more intense
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
moments um if for kids that might be
 
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
within YDC so again we're just trying to
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
minimize the if you will the demand in
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
in the the push of kids to walk away
 
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
from that facility having more of those
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
opportunities within the facility keeps
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
it more secure and there's a couple
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
small pieces in here to retain you know
 
00:11:40.509 --> 00:11:40.519 align:start position:0%
helping to retain staff areas where we
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
can train staff uh in different aspects
 
00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh Lessons Learned type scenarios um
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
those types of build outs again if we're
 
00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:49.959 align:start position:0%
retraining more staff we can again uh
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
have a better eye on the facility and
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
and reduce that Demand on the town of
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
Hamstead police State Police whatever it
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
might require um so it's all just
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
building out a much better experience
 
00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
experience for those kids but more
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
importantly a more secure facility uh
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
for the town of
 
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
Hamstead uh item four uh so that's the
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
the bulk of really the that's about half
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
of the item and that's that's the bulk
 
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
of the kind of the mental health pieces
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh the most of the the remainder of
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
these items for this uh 13.78 million
 
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
are more legislative requests Less on
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
the mental health side of things um now
 
00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
item four was
 
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
$685,000 uh for the Department of
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
Corrections this is a uh for a previous
 
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
project it's an ongoing project uh for
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
the repair of air handlers and duct work
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
over at the Men's prison um the base
 
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
project has been funded by this by this
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
group that was wonderful but due to um
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
inflationary cost and supply chain
 
00:12:43.949 --> 00:12:43.959 align:start position:0%
issues they're looking for another
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
$685,000 so we're we're mostly done the
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
project we're looking to finish out uh
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
finish out the project at 685,000 uh a
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
few of the Reps and and state senators
 
00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
had called us and asked to make sure
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
that that this project could get
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
done uh the department of Environmental
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
Services also looking uh this was
 
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
$500,000 dealing with a very public
 
00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:05.959 align:start position:0%
issue we all hear about every day
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria um to take a step back
 
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
Dees currently has we have fully funded
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
and this in the legislature has done a
 
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
great job fully funding the remediation
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
of cyanobacteria concerns that can be
 
00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:21.079 align:start position:0%
remediated today so if there's
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria in a lake and we can put
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
remediation to it it's this technical
 
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
Alum stuff you put in the water it
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
really encapsulates the cyanobacteria um
 
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
there de yeses I think has done a good
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
job um moving those projects forward the
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
reason we don't have more projects ready
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
to go is a lot of the smaller towns
 
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
don't have the funds to figure out how
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
bad the problem is so these going
 
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
through the Lakes Association they'll be
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
coordinating with towns and localities
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
other smaller Lake Associations um uh
 
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
Community associations to do those
 
00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
studies to figure out is there
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria issue how bad is it and
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
and what kind type of mitigation needs
 
00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
to be done at that point down the road
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
obviously I think we all understand that
 
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
there may need to be additional funds to
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
mitigate that those issues if the
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria persists but um the it's
 
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
it's a bit of an unknown especially for
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of these smaller communities and
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
this $500,000 will allow them to do
 
00:14:13.079 --> 00:14:14.230 align:start position:0%
this $500,000 will allow them to do
those

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
studies uh the department of admin
 
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
Services is uh uh has a 1.3 two two
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
requests one at $1.3 million um it's a
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
state house uh compliance issue with ADA
 
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
compliance obviously that's a
 
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
requirement it's a bathrooms issue we
 
00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:32.839 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that we upgrade uh the
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
the public facilities uh that are to
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're ADA Compliant
 
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
there's another uh at Department of
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
administrative Services piece here for
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
2.4 million uh for this very building
 
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
for the um uh improvements to the State
 
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
House Annex Building Renovations
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
including electrical Mechanical plumbing
 
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
improvements and including some of the
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
removal of hazardous waste um items that
 
00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:55.759 align:start position:0%
come and then finally uh to round out
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
this $ 13.78 million request um gopher
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
has a $1.4 million request uh
 
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
technically for to the county of
 
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
straford they have a roof a very
 
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:07.959 align:start position:0%
significant very severe roof leakage
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
problem uh that really has to be
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
addressed immediately um so when we
 
00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
looked at some of the higher needs and
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
priorities this was one that um if not
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
funded I there's kind of a question of
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
where those funds might come from so
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
we're just looking to assist the
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
courthouse um which we've done before
 
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
but this is a little more of an
 
00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
emergency need that rounds out the 13.78
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
million again is um kind of putting it
 
00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:31.959 align:start position:0%
all together trying to be efficient get
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
these things done and allow the
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
executive Council because as we know the
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
the commission the Commissioners
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
themselves the agencies in the executive
 
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
Council um have their end of the process
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
as well so we can answer any questions
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
you can kick me out ask Taylor oh you
 
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
know I'm good at math that's about it
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Governor questions from
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
committee members representative Edwards
 
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
and representative blazel and thank you
 
00:15:56.309 --> 00:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you governor for
 
00:15:59.309 --> 00:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
considering my questions I I I'm I want
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
to get down into the weeds just a little
 
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
bit and uh I apologize for that I I
 
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner Weaver and Dr hen have done
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
a great job I think at opening up a
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
design review process where a bunch of
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
interested stakeholders could take a
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
look at exactly some of the details of
 
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
the new
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
YDC and um and so there were a few
 
00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
things that I'd like to just make sure
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
that are in the public record that that
 
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to take care of one one is
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
um we want to have the Hamstead hospital
 
00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:35.959 align:start position:0%
and the new YDC as an integrated
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
operation and there's a walkway that you
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
may not even know about that connects
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
the two buildings that are just wide
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
open to weather it was an additional
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
item um I think it's really going to be
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
important that we ensure that that
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
walkway gets to be covered and secure uh
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
in order to um move patients and people
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
and supplies back and forth between the
 
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
buildings in the winter and not have
 
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
problems and so so that's that's a big
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
one I'd like to make sure gets on there
 
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
the the other one is we've talked about
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
the trouble with integrating the
 
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
security of the operations between the
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
Hamstead hospital and the new YDC right
 
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
now it it feels like the infrastructure
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
is there for two different Security
 
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
offices and and because the it is uh
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
incompatible there's been some issues
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
about trying to integrate into a single
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
secure um Management Center and i' I'd
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
like to know if we're going to try to
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
resolve that in this initial buildout
 
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
because that would help with the
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
security issue and and then the the
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
third thing is um maybe doesn't have a
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
budget impact but it's about worrying
 
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
about whether or not drones may be able
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
to drop paraphernalia and other things
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
into the wreck wreck area there were
 
00:18:02.909 --> 00:18:02.919 align:start position:0%
some technical options considered I just
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
would like an update on that so that we
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
could get those three things sort of
 
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
locked in on what our our intent is with
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
this money sure so I can I can address a
 
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
couple of them and I may have to ask the
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
the commissioner to come up uh I do
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
believe the walkway has not been
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
included the walkway was priced out at
 
00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:21.559 align:start position:0%
just under $1 million for the walkway
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
that was expensive and I think it was
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
determined that um if there's another
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
way to do it obviously I I completely
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
agree with you I think it' be phenomenal
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
to have that but I think at a million
 
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
dollars for an enclosed walkway that
 
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
just didn't make the list of of you know
 
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
make the top priorities um including uh
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
as far as the Drone technology I don't
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
believe we've that that's I know it's
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
been talked about and looked at over at
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
the Men's prison and I I didn't realize
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
it was being talked about here I don't
 
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
know if you you have any information on
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
that sure good morning yes uh we are
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
working with admin services in DPW now
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
to explore no fly zones for things like
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
drones imagine that would include the
 
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
and then if I may a million dollars to
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
cover that walkway is probably $950,000
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
too much uh I I had the same gut
 
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
reaction to that and and and that's why
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
I've been so obsessive about getting
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
that walkway covered is because it just
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
seems to me like it's so obvious it has
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
to be done uh and the the money estimate
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
is just way out of bounds Beyond Common
 
00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:26.919 align:start position:0%
Sense yeah I maybe there's an
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go out and and rebid that
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
piece I mean it's a walkway it doesn't
 
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
have to be done in conjunction with the
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
main construction obviously it would be
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
easier to do that um you know one idea
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
would be just to again we one thing
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
we've tried to we've di I want to
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
reemphasize something we're not adding
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
any new beds to IDC we're not changing
 
00:19:44.909 --> 00:19:44.919 align:start position:0%
the footprint or anything like that I
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
guess you could always design ask the
 
00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
the the contractor just to plan the
 
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
space I mean you could do a small
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
redesign if if a future walkway was
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
possible but right now at nearly a
 
00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:57.559 align:start position:0%
million dollars the needs were more on
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
the beds and you know the care of the
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
kids and the secur and and the
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
additional security pieces that I know
 
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
the community was looking for so thank
 
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
you I didn't it's way in the weeds I'm
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
so sorry to bring it up good questions
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
and I and I would just if I may
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
definitely something to look at in the
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
future um you know depending on on the
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
demand there senator birdell for a
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
governor for taking my question has
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
there been any consideration in um in
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
some of this money to reimburse uh the
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
town of Hamstead for all of the uh
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
emergency response work that they've
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
done over the past year Well I believe
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's taken up with the property the
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
the property tax uh allocation that was
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
made by the legislature
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
well and I thank you for um putting that
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
um having that passed but
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
191,000 doesn't really recoup a lot of
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
the money that was spent on the
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
emergency response I can get a number
 
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
from the um chief of police but um it's
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
probably cost a lot more than 191,000
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature can look at that this is
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
one-time money so I would say so we're
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
trying to keep the onetime arpa dollars
 
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
to onetime infrastructure construction
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
costs that would theoretically be an
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
ongoing cost and I my sense is as as the
 
00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
facility opens up the long-term Demand
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
on both Hamstead and YDC because we
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
don't even have YDC up and running yet
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
um I think we'll be we'll be better
 
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
determined and obviously something for
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature to look at but we just
 
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
Tred to keep everything to onetime money
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
and and I I understand that my my
 
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
thought process is to recoup what
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
they've spent in the past because the
 
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
numbers of visits I believe has started
 
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
going down so it's not it's probably not
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
going to be an issue go as much going
 
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
forward but what they've spent in the
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
past is is what I'm I'm concerned about
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
yeah well I
 
00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:57.559 align:start position:0%
I I would I would only say that I'm not
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
against doing that if it's a one time
 
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
cost other than today's kind of the day
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
like I don't have that data it sounds
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
like you don't have that that
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
information I don't think we've ever
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
been sent a bill or an invoice above the
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
property tax piece that that we are we
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
are granting which is a large amount of
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
money so that would probably require a
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
little more analysis in terms of what
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
that what that was thank you yeah
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
senator rosenal for a question thank you
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you governor for being here my
 
00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
question really I think is for
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner Weaver
 
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
um we are all on board about having a
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
prtf and um bringing New Hampshire's
 
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919 align:start position:0%
children back who don't quite need
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
Hospital level
 
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
care about two years
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
ago when the prtf was being constructed
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
we got a tour and we're told it was a 12
 
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.430 align:start position:0%
we got a tour and we're told it was a 12
B

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
B
 
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
prtf so I guess my question is how is it
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
that the department was building a 12
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
bed unit and it turned out that it was
 
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
only a six-bed unit and now we have to
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
spend a lot more money to make it what
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
you were planning to
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
do sure um I think it's worth noting
 
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
this is the first PRT that New Hampshire
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
has so um first Venture into the space
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
it is actually there actually are 12
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
beds as we open the facility um and pro
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
provided care it became clear pretty
 
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:45.039 align:start position:0%
quickly that the space was limiting to
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
safely provide that clinical care for
 
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
the 12 so it kept the census lower which
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
is what the governor is referring to
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
around that six um so when we built that
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
out the time um through clinical
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
practice prce said we needed more square
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
footage as well as single bedrooms so
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
that became and I think the governor
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned that as well became critical
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
that we have uh a safe environment for
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
kids and that we can take more kids so
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
we know that by making the single
 
00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
bedrooms by expanding that footprint
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
creating some life skill areas a larger
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
um space where they're not necessarily
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
as uh closer proximity will allow us to
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
take kids and be more successful and be
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
at that 12 rather than hovering between
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
that six and that eight so I think it's
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
you know as you open it up and as you go
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
these are things that you find out it's
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
an old building it's over 50 years old
 
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
and it really hasn't had any renovation
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
so we tried to make it work in the space
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
with the vendor that we had at the time
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
and this is the point we're at right now
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
um followup thank you but I but I know
 
00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
that you have colleagues in other states
 
00:24:51.149 --> 00:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
and belong to
 
00:24:51.159 --> 00:24:52.870 align:start position:0%
and belong to
associations

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
associations
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
where you can gain from the expertise of
 
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
other states that have had
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
ptfs did the
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
department take advantage of
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
saying asking questions like or do
 
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
double rooms work how how many single
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
beds do we need or did we just go into
 
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.430 align:start position:0%
beds do we need or did we just go into
it

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
blind no I don't think we went into it
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
blind and we were we just had opened up
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
the hospital taking over the hospital
 
00:25:25.149 --> 00:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
and then adding a brand new service line
 
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
with a new vendor at the time so we did
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
do a lot of research the vendor did a
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
lot of research at the time um and I
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
think through practice we found out that
 
00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:35.799 align:start position:0%
the current foot we had is not uh
 
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
clinically safe and we want to expand
 
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
that so I think there's good sound
 
00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:41.559 align:start position:0%
programming there I think it's the
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that needs to be matched
 
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
programming or adjusted or edited if you
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
will edited yeah if I may add the just
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
to be clear the 12 beds meet the federal
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
guidelines and I think that's what we oh
 
00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
well the guidelines say X Y and Z and
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
you can double up and all that but again
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
when you look I'm just speaking I don't
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
have the expertise of of the
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner but the high intensity
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
needs of some of these kids don't don't
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
really allow for a double bed situation
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
all the time or they don't have other
 
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
common areas or or open areas and that
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
that makes for a a tougher therapeutic
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh assessment and treatment of those
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
individuals um which again this is all
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
designed to make if the atmosphere and
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
the treatment and the the clinical
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
process is more fitting to those kids
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to have less of them trying
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
to get out if you will or walk away from
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
the facility uh or or act out in other
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
ways so yeah it all meets the federal
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines now I guess technically you
 
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
could you could pack 12 kids in there
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
you could but it's not going to be good
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's not going to meet the needs of
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
those kids um and ultimately this is all
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
about the care right getting the kids
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
the best care um and and making sure the
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
facility is safe and and the staff feel
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
safe and the staff feel like they can
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
actually do the treatment that they were
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
they were designed to do and I think I
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
mean we I I don't I think it's okay to
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
say I've personally spoken to mlan Great
 
00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:06.039 align:start position:0%
institution in in um Massachusetts that
 
00:27:08.909 --> 00:27:08.919 align:start position:0%
handles uh that these types of prtf uh
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
facilities beds the the high-intensive
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
and I they all concur that yeah federal
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines are one thing the
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
requirements are one thing but meeting
 
00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:18.919 align:start position:0%
the needs of the kids to to get them the
 
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039 align:start position:0%
best care and uh and limit the amount of
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
um of you know attempts of walking away
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
from a facility like that require some
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
editing editing
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
we'll use that word if I could I I don't
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
dispute any of that my question is just
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
Why why didn't
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
we take advantage of what people as
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
close as mlan could have told us two
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
years ago so we did it right the first
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
time that's all obviously we want to
 
00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:57.519 align:start position:0%
treat the kids in the best way but I'm
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
just wondering why we didn't do a better
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
job planning it the first time thank
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
you senator birdell for a question just
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
quickly so if we didn't if we didn't
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
have this found money so to speak would
 
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
we still be looking to expand that
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
space yes I was going to be making a
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
so any other questions recognize Senator
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
gray I'm move uh FIS 24 371 found under
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
Tab 7 for approval second motion a
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
second further discussion on item 24
 
00:28:42.029 --> 00:28:42.039 align:start position:0%
371 do we have to take it off the
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
first no no
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
okay we've already taken it off so
 
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
accomplished well
 
00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
parlamentar okay that we have not taken
 
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
up the consent calendar yet so and
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%

approve it that I mentioned both the
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman uh I agree there are needs
 
00:31:33.629 --> 00:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
but there are lots of needs mental
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
health has lots of needs we're running
 
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
mental health facilities at negatives
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
and we're treating people there with
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
very significant problems this is a
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
$500,000 item I have great empathy for
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
for the animals certainly uh but I have
 
00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:54.039 align:start position:0%
more empathy for human beings who need
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
services and when I see that my mental
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
health Center is running in the negative
 
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
when I see the mental health center in
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
Conan is running at the negative and I
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
see $500,000 going of to a datable
 
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
shelter I say where are our
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
priorities my priorities my priority is
 
00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
taking care of people that's what I ran
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
for that's what I've been here for for a
 
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
long period of Time That's
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
essential and we know the suicide rate
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
is high we know people living in the in
 
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
in the streets
 
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
because they can't take care of
 
00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
themselves I mean we have basic
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as Citizens and as
 
00:32:38.919 --> 00:32:39.990 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as Citizens and as
elected

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
elected
 
00:32:42.629 --> 00:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
officials and I think this
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
$500,000 could be better
 
00:32:48.629 --> 00:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
spent based on the needs that have
 
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
manifested themselves over and over
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
again we had a windfall of of money we
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
should use it as we see best to satisfy
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
the needs of people thank you Mr
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
chairman further
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
Edwards thank you Mr chair and if the
 
00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:15.559 align:start position:0%
senator take a a question I because I
 
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
I'm moved by your argument um but I'd
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
just like to get some clarity on your
 
00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
position are you aware of another
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
$500,000 one-time investment that we
 
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
should be making in the mental health
 
00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
system or or were you talking about
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
using it for operational issues that
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
we'd have to have a funding tail for uh
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question make make
 
00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
make sure that I understand the clarity
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
of it what what I'm saying is we have
 
00:33:47.629 --> 00:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
had requests from mental health centers
 
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
for money they and we gave them money we
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
gave them
 
00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
500,000 that didn't satisfy all of their
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
need but it was what was available at
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
the time another 500,000 now has become
 
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
available it seems to me that we should
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
address needs that we couldn't address
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
fully at the time because we didn't have
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
the money now we have more money because
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
of the windfall that has been created by
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
the return of the 15 billion dollar from
 
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
Solutions health because they're not
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
building the they not building the
 
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
building I think the direction of this
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
500,000 should be to address that
 
00:34:27.069 --> 00:34:27.079 align:start position:0%
situation that we could only partially
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
address in the passed I hope that's the
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
lean thank you Mr chairman is it
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
possible we could have the commissioner
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
come up and explain why he supports this
 
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.790 align:start position:0%
come up and explain why he supports this
request

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
yes is the commissioner
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
you question was sorry Taylor cwell
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
I guess I was just curious uh you made
 
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
the request and maybe you could justify
 
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
the request for us so this is a request
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
that we have um had ongoing for quite
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
some time uh from the Manchester Animal
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
Shelter uh if we go back to uh I believe
 
00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
even uh late Caris or early arpa there
 
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
was a request for uh funding for animal
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
shelters generally um we did do an
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
analysis at that time which indicated
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
that um you know there wasn't
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily a need for operational uh
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
costs um uh to be provided to uh animal
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
shelters across the state and so that
 
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
one did not come to you at the time uh
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
since then we have had a subsequent
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
request from the Manchester Animal
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
Shelter initially for an amount of $2.5
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
million for a complete re um rehab of
 
00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.829 align:start position:0%
million for a complete re um rehab of
their

00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
facility um we did determined that we
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to be provide the full
 
00:36:00.599 --> 00:36:01.829 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to be provide the full
$2.5

00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
$2.5
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
million uh for that fac so we push we we
 
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
we put forward the request for a request
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
for $500,000 and that's sort of how it
 
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
today for for my own opinion we we
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
thought this would be onetime money we
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
should spend it on onetime events
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
obviously mental health continues on
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
forever and I believe there are some
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
other items in here that assist the uh
 
00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:31.079 align:start position:0%
within this agenda that assist mental
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
health so we've got it we've got these
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
needs from all over but one time onetime
 
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
events should possibly take precedent on
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
some of these monies because they won't
 
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
be coming back repeatedly for another
 
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
building so that's the way I looked at
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
it Senator Rosenwald then Senator B
 
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
thank you if I could respond to
 
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
representative edwards's question as
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
well I think both
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
the Community Mental Health Centers and
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
the federally qualified Health Centers
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
both had
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
onetime funding gaps because of the
 
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.990 align:start position:0%
onetime funding gaps because of the
Medicaid

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
unwind where a significant number of
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
people lost eligibility
 
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.910 align:start position:0%
people lost eligibility
for

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
insurance however their care
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
continued either those people now have
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
rejoined Medicaid or have found some
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
other insurance or in some case they
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
aged out of Medicaid but to me those are
 
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
onetime funds because the unwind is
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
complete so I agree with my colleague
 
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.150 align:start position:0%
complete so I agree with my colleague
Senator

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
dandro that um our Mental Health crisis
 
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
and also the federally qualified Health
 
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
Centers they got very small Medicaid
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
rate increases so I think one-time
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
infusions of this money could be
 
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
incredibly helpful for the people of New
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you Senator bir shall
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
then Senator agree I would just I mean I
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
don't disagree what with what my
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues have said however we just
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
authorized over $2 million to Hamstead
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
hospital to help with the U mental
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
health of our our kids um and we have
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of money in our budget and
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
we will continue to spend a lot of money
 
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
in our budget on the mental health of
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
our our our residents so um
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
$500,000 I think um for this for
 
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester Animal Shelter I think is not
 
00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
unreasonable and I'm going to go ahead
 
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
and support
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
it Senator gray um if you take any of
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
the individual items that we've
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
processed throughout these past
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
months one or two May stand out to you
 
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
okay but if you look back to the
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
philosophy that the the budget that we
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
just passed for the
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
state everybody got a little bit
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
everybody got a little bit and that's
 
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
how we were able to pass it through the
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
Senate and that's how we were able to
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
pass it through the house we are taking
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
one small item
 
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
in the millions and millions of dollars
 
00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
that we've done here and putting a
 
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
microscope on it as I said at the
 
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
beginning of this when we right after we
 
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:39.640 align:start position:0%
pulled it off the table it is a lot of
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
money and as the commissioner said we've
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
taken the request from 2.5 and given
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
them a fifth of
 
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
it is it the right thing to
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
do well again if we are looking at
 
00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.030 align:start position:0%
do well again if we are looking at
saying

00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
this group deserves
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
something this group deserves something
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
which is like I said the philosophy that
 
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
was used when we created the budget that
 
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
we are living under right now this fits
 
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
in this is one of those items that ought
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
to get their little piece and that's why
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
item Senator Pearl thank you
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner you you said you had a $25
 
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
million do request originally and one
 
00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns I always have and
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps you can address this for me is
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
when we take and partially fund any
 
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
request is that the money we're giving
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
them they'll be able to actually do good
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
things with it were you able to identify
 
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
that this half a million dollars would
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
be able to cover some of the real high
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
priority projects of the two and a half
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
million they originally
 
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
requested yes Senator we did do U an
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
analysis of their capability to uh
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
complete the project because we don't
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
just have the obligation deadline that
 
00:40:59.309 --> 00:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
is the subject of a lot of the
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
discussion today we have the full
 
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
expenditure deadline which is uh
 
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
December 31st 2026 so we don't bring
 
00:41:08.349 --> 00:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
anything forward to you that we don't
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
think they going to have the potential
 
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
you representative Edwards uh thank you
 
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and uh thank you Mr
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner I so what I think I've I've
 
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
heard is that um this this onetime money
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
is being set up to be used for long-term
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
ongoing infrastructure at the animal
 
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
shelter and that while there may be
 
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
other operational ways to spend the
 
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
money in mental health we don't have an
 
00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.589 align:start position:0%
money in mental health we don't have an
identified

00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:41:44.599 --> 00:41:46.150 align:start position:0%
identified
unfunded

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure alternative in the mental
 
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
health area that's competing with this
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
animal shelter infrastructure I it just
 
00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
came from Rome they built things for
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
3,000 years I I want to know that this
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
money is going to go to building
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
something that's going to be sustainable
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
for many many years in the future and
 
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
not a one-time expense can is C could
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
you just clarify was there a
 
00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.589 align:start position:0%
you just clarify was there a
competing

00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
competing
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure project for a half a
 
00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.430 align:start position:0%
infrastructure project for a half a
million

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
dollars um I would say um representative
 
00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of requests that have come
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
in um I wouldn't be able to say
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
definitively that there isn't a match
 
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
for this particular amount of money for
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
a amount of requests that we've had from
 
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
other in other categories
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
um um so I I'm not sure that I could
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
definitely say to you if not this it
 
00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
would there would be nowhere else to
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%

3 72 we have already passed item
 
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
24371 so that is not included now in the
 
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
consent calendar Senator Gray
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%

the rest of the items on the consent
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
calendar by Senator gray second by
 
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
Senator bird cell further
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
discussion guess we've got all the items
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
that are going to be removed all in
 
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
favor of the items of adopting the
 
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
remaining items say I I oppose
 
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
no remaining items are adopted so we'll
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
believe it was was that representative
 
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
that uh I don't believe that was my
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
question I my note said uh
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative for the Senate oh I think
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
that was the Senate Senator
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
rosenal I did have a question but I
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%

s Bill
 
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
499 um which was for summer EBT benefits
 
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
the bill was passed on June
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
13 and um for some reason did not get
 
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
signed until August 2nd making us miss

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
be there next
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
summer I mean I just I don't understand
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
the timing of this because it was for
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
summer food
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
benefits thank you very much senator for
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
your question and concern I this is a
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
program that was newly established by
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
the US Department of Agriculture uh and
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
the rules and guidance for this program
 
00:47:59.470 --> 00:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
did not not get released until December
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
and then into January and February the
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
federal government was very aware of the
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
late start of establishing this to issue
 
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
a summer of 2024 benefit so the states
 
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
have been working very closely with the
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
federal government to get the benefit
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
distributed as soon as it possibly can
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
but it has always been known uh from the
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
beginning uh of the calendar year that
 
00:48:28.829 --> 00:48:28.839 align:start position:0%
we would Target and uh to get the
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
benefit issued in November and into
 
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
December it has always been planned that
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
way um and we have uh uh certainly
 
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
spoken about it a number of times uh in
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
different forums about that plan the
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
federal government also did not approve
 
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
the state's plan for the summer of 2024
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
benefit until August
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
16th so despite that we do want this to
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
be a summer
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
related benefit it has always been known
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
that we would not be able to implement
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
the distribution until the fall which we
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
are doing the intent is to be able to uh
 
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
have this program in place so long as
 
00:49:14.109 --> 00:49:14.119 align:start position:0%
the federal government approves the
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
state's plan uh year after year and that
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
the funding exists as well so that the
 
00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:23.079 align:start position:0%
benefit could be issued prior to the
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
beginning of the summer op what's known
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
as a summer operating period period
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
which would start uh as soon as classes
 
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh end in that current school year and
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
it would last through the period of time
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
when classes resume in that following
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
school year period uh so that that is
 
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
the intent but as I as I mentioned it
 
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
certainly has been um a challenge to be
 
00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
able to get the funding uh distributed
 
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
as close to summer as we
 
00:49:58.349 --> 00:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
can follow up thank you you so because
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
it the legislative intent was for a
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
summer EBT program and it's
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
$150 which I mean I go grocery shopping
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
so I know that I know it doesn't go that
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
far did the department give
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
consideration towards holding off for
 
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
next summer so that school children who
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily really have access to
 
00:50:34.109 --> 00:50:34.119 align:start position:0%
nutritious food during the summer would
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
have this
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
$150 benefit next
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
summer so it's an annual benefit uh so
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
that would happen regardless of what we
 
00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
did with a summer of 24 benefit the
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
intent is to have a summer benefit each
 
00:50:52.839 --> 00:51:00.549 align:start position:0%
intent is to have a summer benefit each
summer

00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
so from what you're what you're saying
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
that even though that we missed the boat
 
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
here or somebody missed the boat here
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's a recurring program and it will now
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
be in the
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
summer yes the the plan uh and according
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
to requirements for the program we would
 
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
be issuing the
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
benefit just before the beginning of the
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
summer operating period because the
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
intent is to have this benefit available
 
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
when school is not in session uh so that
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's the the target to be able
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
to implement this before the summer
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
operating period but the because of the
 
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
late start of the entire program with
 
00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
the federal government we weren't able
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
to do that for summer of
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
24 so we missed it we missed it one time
 
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
but in the future we've got it
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
covered so long as the federal
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
government approved proves the state
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
plan every year and that the funding is
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
available yes sir okay so we have no
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
guarantee that this is an ongoing
 
00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
program for a number of years it's just
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
every year you have to apply for this
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
that is correct it would seem to make
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
more sense to hold this money for next
 
00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:14.799 align:start position:0%
summer I think we'd all support that
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
rather than having it spent now and then
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
an expectation next fall to have the
 
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
same money again rather than spending it
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
now and and when all the meals are going
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
to be provided out of school anyway so
 
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.510 align:start position:0%
to be provided out of school anyway so
representative

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
Edwards thank you division 3 spent quite
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
a bit of time on SP 499 that Senator
 
00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald mentioned and we amended that
 
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
bill and left the summer EBT portion in
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
it um we at the time and and this is one
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the details I want to clarify this
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
$5.6 million this is for the two fiscal
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
years and not just the first fiscal year
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
that because that's the amount of money
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
we thought the total 2-year program
 
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
would be that there would be 2 months in
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
24 July and August and that there'd be
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
the full three months in the following
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
year the biggest criticism of this
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
program when division 3 spent a lot of
 
00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
time on it was that it's labeled a
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
summer EBT program but we knew that the
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
program wasn't going to be able to get
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
established until there was a
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
retroactive payment in in around
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
Halloween so so we knew that we the kids
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
weren't going to get the money in the
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
summer but they the family would catch
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
up around Halloween so so
 
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
I so I I I kind of I support that intent
 
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
because that's that's what we try to do
 
00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:47.799 align:start position:0%
I I just want to make sure that this is
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
not just 24 money this is 24 and 25
 
00:53:56.789 --> 00:53:56.799 align:start position:0%
money so this award is specifically the
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
benefit funds for the summer of
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
2024 and it needs to be expended uh
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
before the end of the calendar year of
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
24 we will or we
 
00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
anticipate a separate award specifically
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
for the summer of
 
00:54:20.789 --> 00:54:20.799 align:start position:0%
2025 uh which we would bring back before
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
you the okay maybe I'm getting confused
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
that there were the general funds got
 
00:54:29.789 --> 00:54:29.799 align:start position:0%
that there's a combination of state and
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
federal money in here and the and that
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is the total of
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
both sure um so so ju just to clarify a
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
couple of things SP 499 did have a
 
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
number of general fund Appropriations
 
00:54:45.309 --> 00:54:45.319 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the Appropriations
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
within the bill you'll see that there
 
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
were two positions established there as
 
00:54:51.549 --> 00:54:51.559 align:start position:0%
well as the funding that was needed to
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
make the system changes those were the
 
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
general fund costs that were required
 
00:54:58.589 --> 00:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
the dollars that you see here this is
 
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
the federal award for the summer of 2024
 
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
benefits and you'll see also that we are
 
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:07.240 align:start position:0%
creating a new account here so in the
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
next budget cycle um I I would expect a
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
change request at some point once we
 
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
have better information on what we would
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
expect these Federal benefits to be but
 
00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
these dollars here are explicitly for
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
the benefits to be paid out for 2024
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
alone and then those other general fund
 
00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
dollars that representative Edwards was
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
referencing was to help stand up the
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
program and you'll see in the grant
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
award documentation that's provided to
 
00:55:34.589 --> 00:55:34.599 align:start position:0%
you the award wasn't provided until
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
August 16th of this year which again is
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
sort of why and at for the many
 
00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
challenges that that Karen uh
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
articulated why we're coming here now
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
and why the payments will be made
 
00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.670 align:start position:0%
and why the payments will be made
through

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:55:51.069 --> 00:55:51.079 align:start position:0%
November follow thank you for refreshing
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
my memory Mr White I I and and it's
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
clear that this is 100% the Federal
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
component and we were willing to spend
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
General funds to get us set up so that
 
00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:03.039 align:start position:0%
we would be eligible for this and it had
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
a nice payback it was about 79% or
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
something so so I I intend to vote in
 
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
favor of this U because I I think it's
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
completely consistent with what our
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
intent was U as it came out of the
 
00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:21.640 align:start position:0%
house representa Senator rosenal thank
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
you um is the
 
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
department planning to put this program
 
00:56:32.029 --> 00:56:32.039 align:start position:0%
in its efficiency budget or will it be a
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
prioritized need the Department's agency
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
budget has already been submitted that
 
00:56:39.789 --> 00:56:39.799 align:start position:0%
was due back in August and because we
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
did not yet have a specific account
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
established for this we we did not
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
include that until we came through
 
00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:49.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal to accept those funds uh during
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
the budget process um I I I do expect
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
that we will be making a request to
 
00:56:56.589 --> 00:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
incorporate these funds into the budget
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
process and into the new account that
 
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
has been established but due to system
 
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
limitations the account didn't exist so
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
you I don't believe we have a motion to
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
approve and I would make that at this
 
00:57:12.119 --> 00:57:13.069 align:start position:0%
approve and I would make that at this
point

00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
second okay Senator gray moves to
 
00:57:19.029 --> 00:57:19.039 align:start position:0%
adopt Senator birdell seconds is there
 
00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
discussion I am not in favor of putting
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
money out that was supposed to be for
 
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
summer when wasn't meals to into the
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
fall when there are meals and so there
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
there'll be an expectation in the
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
proceed in the consuing Years well I got
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
it last year why don't I have it this
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
year and I think it's a dangerous thing
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
to do any further
 
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all in favor of
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
this say I I oppose no
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
no moving on to the next item off of
 
00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:57.150 align:start position:0%
no moving on to the next item off of
consent

00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.109 --> 00:58:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
one this was a senate office this was I
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
think this was a senate request for
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
removal um all of the items on this page
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
that you've put on uh pulled uh I had no
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
notes on them being pulled by a senator
 
00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
so representative Wier if I may um you
 
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
did just have a question in House pref
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal relative to the definition of
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
foreign organization foreign that was my
 
00:58:45.029 --> 00:58:45.039 align:start position:0%
that was my question that's an exhibit a
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
of of their submission there's a very
 
00:58:48.559 --> 00:58:50.430 align:start position:0%
of of their submission there's a very
lengthy

00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
lengthy
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
um exhibits added to this item some of
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
them raised my my caution when we're
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
talking about foreign governments and
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
and foreign languages and all this kind
 
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
of thing I'm suspicious of what I've
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
seen in some in some states of
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
taking immigrants whether they're legal
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
or illegal and making them police
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
officers is there any thought is is that
 
00:59:22.589 --> 00:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
included in this
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%

standards and training uh presently uh
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
through administrative rule uh one of
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
the requirements to be a police officer
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire is to be a
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
United States
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
citizen uh and there is no other uh
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
waiver or any other pathway to become a

foreign governments and so on it is our
 
00:59:59.470 --> 00:59:59.480 align:start position:0%

01:00:02.029 --> 01:00:02.039 align:start position:0%
boilerplate uh template language that is
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%

more related to
 
01:01:59.309 --> 01:01:59.319 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not we have developed any
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
sort of metrics to understand whether or
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
not the money that we're spending the
 
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
federal money we're spending uh actually
 
01:02:10.589 --> 01:02:10.599 align:start position:0%

things I just am looking for the
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
analytical part of this to say What
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
metric are we going to use to know
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're achieving the the
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
aims and goals of this uh new
 
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%

Ian wat I'm the director for the
 
01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health Services so
 
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
the the home visiting program uses
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
something called the healthy uh family
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
America's evidence-based model uh which
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
speaks to exactly the the kind of
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
metrics you're you're looking to
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
determine representative Edwards so
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
things like number of families that are
 
01:02:57.309 --> 01:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
are not entering um a child welfare
 
01:02:59.950 --> 01:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
system do not have an open case with DCF
 
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
so we are we are trying to make sure
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
that families receive referrals to
 
01:03:06.269 --> 01:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
services and care so they're developing
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
healthy habits healthy habits as a
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
family healthy parenting and and School
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
Readiness uh all those metrics are

question so this is going to sound like
 
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
groundhog D it's the same issue I just
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%

management to evaluate whether or not
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%

position thank you Mr chair that

satisfies my question I'd be willing to
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%

motion and a second to approve item
 
01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
362 is there any further discussion
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none all in favor say I I oppose
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
no 24362 is adopted we're moving on to
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
24358 and this dealt with Medicaid to
 
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:57.269 align:start position:0%
24358 and this dealt with Medicaid to
schools

01:05:57.269 --> 01:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:59.269 --> 01:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards had a
 
01:06:02.589 --> 01:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
question uh thank thank you uh Mr chair
 
01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
I I
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
um my my question um about this is
 
01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.670 align:start position:0%
um my my question um about this is
really

01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
um I as I as I came to understand this
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
program uh my initial concerns about
 
01:06:21.789 --> 01:06:21.799 align:start position:0%
parental rights being protected were
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
were addressed a year or two ago when we
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
were more in a pilot phase and now we're
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
building the program out and I just want
 
01:06:33.269 --> 01:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure that um we have assurances
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
that parents are going to uh firmly be
 
01:06:39.069 --> 01:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
in a consent role for the services
 
01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
provided and that they will in all cases
 
01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
be entitled to receive the information
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
regarding their students care through
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
the program uh regardless of any sort of
 
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
HIPPA concerns or any other concerns or
 
01:06:59.829 --> 01:06:59.839 align:start position:0%
are are we are we protecting the parents
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
ability to parent uh as we build out the
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for schools
 
01:07:08.349 --> 01:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
program I think the short answer is yes
 
01:07:12.269 --> 01:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
if I can just explain I think how um in
 
01:07:14.589 --> 01:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
order to participate in this program you
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
have to be Medicaid enrolled uh a minor
 
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
cannot enroll themselves so they have to
 
01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
have the parent enrolled in Medicaid um
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
secondly with respect to the service
 
01:07:29.069 --> 01:07:29.079 align:start position:0%
Services the services are to support IEP
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
plans the individual education plan for
 
01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
a child that has a disability or a 504
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
plan which is um for a medical condition
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
um and so to be able to participate in
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
learning right that's supposed to
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
support that both those plans require um
 
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
the the parents consent they also um
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
typically are developed in consultation
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
with the um the provider that is um the
 
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
associated with the child um then um in
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
addition with respect
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
to before they can even provide a
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
service there has to be consent that um
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
the service can be built to
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um a case head which would be a
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
parent in this case also um has a right
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
uh to obtain um the the billing
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
information but you know I think what
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about here is I
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
think if if uh someone's faithful to
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
what their responsibilities are both at
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
the school level parental level there
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
should be no issue here um and I think
 
01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
what your concern is probably more in
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
the space of outside of the Medicaid
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
schools program because in the Medicaid
 
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
to school program the school itself has
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
to come up with effectively half the
 
01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
cost of of the services so you know
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
someone who might access a program from
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
a school that uh isn't part of the
 
01:08:56.110 --> 01:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to schools program which is
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
focused on supporting the IEPs and the
 
01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
504 plans that that that is that could
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
have that exposure that you're concerned
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
about but um you know I think from an
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
ethical standpoint um you know the the
 
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid schools program and how it's
 
01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
structured I think has good protections
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
for parents and as I said if a you know
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
a parent um who's a case head is
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
entitled to if they ask the Medicaid
 
01:09:22.269 --> 01:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
Program to provide what billing records
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
there are we're we're obligated to
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I I um i' I've heard
 
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
you even before the hearing explain that
 
01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
to me and I'm I'm still just generally
 
01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
concerned about this program uh
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
diverting the attention of the education
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
system into the provision of clinical
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
care and I'm concerned that if we don't
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that the parents remain in
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
charge of their students care completely
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
that we will create a trust issue that
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
will do long-term damage to the
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
educational the faith we have in the
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
educational system so so I'm worried
 
01:10:08.669 --> 01:10:08.679 align:start position:0%
about over the long run the distraction
 
01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
that this program may have on
 
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
maintaining academic Excellence focus
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
and and rather than belabor that I I
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
think we're scheduled for an HHS
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
oversight to do a deep dive on this and
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh and maybe we could take some of the
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
answers there to too I I spent as much
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
time with you on it I think though the
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
one point I want to make sure the
 
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
committee understands is that the the
 
01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid schools program when we're
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
talking about IEP plans you're talking
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
about children with disabilities where
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
the parent is trying to advocate in the
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
school to get services for their child
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
so they can learn or in the 504 plan the
 
01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
child has a medical condition where
 
01:10:49.149 --> 01:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
maybe they need a medication during the
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
day um that they need the school nurse
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
to to to administer um so I think it's a
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
little bit different but I think you
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
know happy to spend more time on that
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know the the CH what's involved in
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
this particular request is it's a
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
fundamental change in how schools are
 
01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
going to get their funding and I'm
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
concerned about the the on-ramp that we
 
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
have to make the change the way that
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
we're doing it today in terms of
 
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
claiming the federal share is going to
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
be a very big change and schools need a
 
01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
good onramp to to be able to to do that
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
we need um as the the grant has a
 
01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
position to support that where we've got
 
01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:31.719 align:start position:0%
a very we got to get to 174 different
 
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
School uh districts leas as they're
 
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
called under this
 
01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
program you know may sound like June 26
 
01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
is far away it's it's really not in
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
terms of by the time we finish the
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
procurement process for a vendor to
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
supply the software to do the the cost
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
reports and um the time studies and for
 
01:11:51.629 --> 01:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
us to educate and and do everything I'm
 
01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
feeling a lot of pressure with respect
 
01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
to making sure that communities don't
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
end up
 
01:11:57.550 --> 01:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
not being able to get funding which will
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
mean you know pressure on local
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities in terms of the cost of
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh supporting a service that they
 
01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
required under uh law to
 
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
provide further so so thank you for all
 
01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm I'm I'm prone to support
 
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
this because this is obviously an in
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
incremental request to change the method
 
01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
for how we you know Bill and get money
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
so so that all makes sense I'm just
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
concerned that as we take these little
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
steps that if we're off a little bit
 
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
then in the long run we may end up
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere we don't want to be and I want
 
01:12:34.629 --> 01:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
at each step of this to be looking at
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
where we really ultimately want to go
 
01:12:39.149 --> 01:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
and if the parents do not have faith in
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
this program um then that then then that
 
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
will keep this from being sustainable I
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
think and undermine the faith people
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
need in the education system as well so
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you for all of that and I I
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
look forward to ongoing cont
 
01:12:58.990 --> 01:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
you motion by Senator dallis Sandra to
 
01:13:04.629 --> 01:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
approve item 358 second by Senator
 
01:13:07.629 --> 01:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
birdell is there any further discussion
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none you ready for the question
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
all in favor say I I oppose no item
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
24358 is adopted we'll move on to tab
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
you for being here so I guess I'm not
 
01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
very good at phrasing questions when I
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
write them so I'm going to try for the
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
third time on a couple of these there's
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
basically two questions I had left on
 
01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
this and most of them were answered very
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
effectively thank you very much um the
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
easy one I hope is of the7
 
01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
properties that were inspected related
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
to the lead levels in 2023 how many were
 
01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
were found to have accessive levels of
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
Le thank you for the question so I would
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
need to uh consult with the team I don't
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
have those numbers in front of me uh if
 
01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to a property uh which is a
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
result again of as noted the the
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement that we inspect a
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
property if a child uh under five tests
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
above the lead Action level um we would
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
have those results internally I would I
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
would have to talk with the team in
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
terms of what is publicly available some
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
of the information is very identifiable
 
01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
so I'll have to work with the team of
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
what information we can share okay well
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
I would certainly hope that providing a
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
number where it was exceeded would have
 
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with any individuals or
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
certainly anybody else and that was
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
really the point I was trying to get
 
01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
across this had to do with the ex x-ray
 
01:14:49.629 --> 01:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
fluorescent devices that you acquired
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
some time ago um for this purpose and I
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
just kind of like represent of Edwards
 
01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
would like to see the the results of the
 
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
when you're spending these monies um
 
01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
what are you achieving so I like to you
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
get information and then the other
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
question which I don't know how I how
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
this one didn't come across but it
 
01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
didn't as I understand it this pot of
 
01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
money that started being allocated way
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
back a couple years ago three years ago
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
maybe um about $22 million I'm not
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
mistaken originally has about $4.4
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
million remaining and I'm trying to and
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
I think if I understand correctly it has
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
to be expended by the end of this year
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
but in any case what I was trying to
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
understand is is it going to be spent
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
and if so on what thank you for the
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
question so the the original Grant uh
 
01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
was awarded in 20121 and the conclusion
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
date was uh May 31st of this year 2024
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
we received earlier this year uh a
 
01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
two-year extension so the funding is
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
actually extended uh at a grant level
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
through uh febu or sorry May 31st of
 
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
2026 uh and we did request an extension
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
for those two years uh we only request
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
extension for one project and that's the
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
community health workers uh that are
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
funded through contracts with our
 
01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Centers
 
01:15:58.629 --> 01:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
public health networks and the Family
 
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers we have uh about 30 of
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
those individuals funded uh $2 and5
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
million of the the 4.4 that you cited is
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
in contract uh and then we would seek to
 
01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
use the additional uh money that's
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
available through of that 4.4 uh through
 
01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
through that through those chws follow I
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
guess I must have misread this I thought
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
that part the turn just referred to or
 
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
actually I'm not referring to the money
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
but the people I thought the statement
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
was they were then moving over to a
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
different program and being funded over
 
01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
there so so the individual so sorry let
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
me let me separate two points this item
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
specifically is to extend a single state
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
position a program planner three that
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
individual is no longer funded by the
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
health disparities Grant the the reason
 
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
that item is before you is that we had
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh an administrative question in terms
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
of the extension of the position it is
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
now funded through a a Federal grant for
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
chronic disease um so it's not the 22
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
million uh is not material to that
 
01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
position anymore it's funded through a
 
01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:01.159 align:start position:0%
chronic disease Grant uh that's a legacy
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
Grant we have in public health that has
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
a I don't have the end date in front of
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
me um the 22 million has no State
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
positions associated with it at this
 
01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
point that four and a half million or
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
$4.4 million is all being used for
 
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
contractual costs for the 30 community
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
health workers that are employed at
 
01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:19.229 align:start position:0%
health workers that are employed at
contracted

01:17:19.229 --> 01:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
contracted
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
agencies okay can you just repeat that
 
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
what you said about the so the two and a
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
half million who you you didn't even
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
name what that was for what did you what
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
was the name you used so those are for
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
community health workers uh and that's
 
01:17:33.629 --> 01:17:33.639 align:start position:0%
contract work done through our FC's uh
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers and the public
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
health network so those entities uh with
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
whom we have contracts would then employ
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
the community health workers directly
 
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much move the item okay
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
motion to move the item who was the
 
01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
second rep representative Edwards move
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
FIS 24343 any further discussion seeing
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
none all in favor say I I the item is
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:30.669 --> 01:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
um sorry I did pull it off but I just
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to pull it off um because I I had
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
some I have some concerns about the um
 
01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
payment to the YDC as as you know and
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
Nathan this has nothing to do with you
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
or the department but um the whole
 
01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
process of how the YDC came to Hamstead
 
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
it to me has been a a completely flawed
 
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
um concept and I'm going to be voting
 
01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
against the
 
01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
numbers thank you Senator Pearl thank
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
you good morning thanks for coming in so
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
as I'm looking through this and reading
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
it I mean I I see you're asking for $5
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
million and and this is a I guess my
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
question is is this a problem that we're
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to solve and with general
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
fund monies next year if we do not solve
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
this with uh non- New Hampshire tax
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
revenue Now using the arpa funds sure
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:35.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:38.510 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess it was a good
 
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:41.070 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess it was a good
[Laughter]

01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
question that's it I so uh Charlie
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
Arling house I'm the commissioner of
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
administrative services and the uh this
 
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
money would support the construction
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
costs and the bid well let me let me
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
start small and then and then you can
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
follow up with it the bids came in high
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
this money would pay for the pay for the
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
construction if you if we don't spend
 
01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
the money like let's say you killed this
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
item which I'm not
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
suggesting um but if you killed this
 
01:20:13.229 --> 01:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
item then we can't go forward with a
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
contract um for the item we would have
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
to renegotiate a contract and do
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
something else and so um in terms of
 
01:20:23.709 --> 01:20:23.719 align:start position:0%
solving it with General funds um no like
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
you couldn't say no and then later
 
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate General funds you have to
 
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
change other laws this is to support the
 
01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
construction of the
 
01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.030 align:start position:0%
construction of the
facility

01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
Well yeah so if if we don't approve this
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to it's going to put the
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
contract in Jeopardy or the project and
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy that you're trying to do now
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
but I guess yeah no if s or buts yeah
 
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't I mean isn't it reasonable
 
01:20:49.229 --> 01:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
to think that at some point we're going
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
to have to do some type of upgrade with
 
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
general fund money later on to try and
 
01:20:55.229 --> 01:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
Achieve what you're trying with this
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
project now well yeah because we have to
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
we have to have a facility and if you
 
01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
don't use arpa funds for it you would
 
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:03.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely have to use General funds
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I guess that was my my
 
01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.830 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I guess that was my my
real

01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
real
 
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
question I I I I think one important
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
consideration is there's a provision
 
01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
from hb2 this past cycle that prohibits
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
use of General funds for this
 
01:21:17.709 --> 01:21:17.719 align:start position:0%
construction so if we don't use arpa
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
funds we don't have another source
 
01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:21.639 align:start position:0%
within our budget today that we could
 
01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
Senator rosenal thank you Mr chairman so
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
as I count up all of the money from what
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
we appropriated already what we approved
 
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
previously in fiscal what we did earlier
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
this morning and what we're being asked
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
for now it looks like this new facility
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.189 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:21:58.189 --> 01:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
legislation that we
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
enacted to build a new
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
facility was for a census of 12 children
 
01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
with a temporary surge capacity of no
 
01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
more than 18 and so I just want to make
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
sure on the public record that we are
 
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
not nobody is planning to ever have more
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
than 18 kids and I have to say also I am
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
hoping when I see the Department's
 
01:22:44.110 --> 01:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
budget that you're going to be budgeting
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
for a census of
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
12 and so that's kind of a two point let
 
01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
me start with a construction standpoint
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
we we're building a facility and and
 
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
week if this item were to pass we expect
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
to go to um governor and councel as soon
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
as humanly possible with a contract with
 
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
huter who was the winning bidder um and
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
the facility we're we're building will
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
not support uh more than flexing to 18
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
it we are not building a facility where
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's even possible to do that so
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
from a from a construction standpoint if
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
you wanted to put more than 18 people on
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
the site ever you would have to uh uh
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
approach more dollars to do so which I
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
know nobody actually wants to do I can't
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
speak to the operating
 
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
budget and and and just to clarify it's
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
it's approximately 35.8 62 million total
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
um when when you will see our agency
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
budget request we are planning for a
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
transition during State fiscal year 27
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
so most of the operating costs that are
 
01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
incurred today to operate the facility
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
will continue to be incurred because
 
01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
that's the time period that last year is
 
01:23:58.030 --> 01:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
a time period at which we're going to be
 
01:24:00.189 --> 01:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
moving um there is a team that has been
 
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
working for probably eight maybe 10
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
months or more on that transition to
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
plan for that and so I'm I'm hoping as
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
we approach the spring particularly
 
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
during the Senate phase uh that we can
 
01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
have further conversations and we'll
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
have additional refinements to that
 
01:24:16.149 --> 01:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
original request and we can work with
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
you to to uh get the appropriate amount
 
01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
the for the
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
facility representative Edwards uh thank
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
01:24:27.550 --> 01:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
um and this this is kind of for the
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner and commissioner earling
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
house as well um when when we started
 
01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:35.719 align:start position:0%
really looking at the the um the
 
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
replacement of the cunu center uh there
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
were uh two two major schools of thought
 
01:24:44.109 --> 01:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
you know one was that we needed to
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
evolve into the therapeutic care uh
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
approach to managing these juveniles at
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
risk and but the other was the enormous
 
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh annual operational cost of the sonunu
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
center and so what that drove us to was
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
a vision in the legislature I think of
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
of of saying that um this really needed
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
to be a shared uh resource operation and
 
01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
that's why I think Hamstead got weighted
 
01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
so well was that by collocation with
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
Hamstead we would be able to share the
 
01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
all the resources the the the personnel
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
the logistics base uh and those sorts of
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
things and that sharing concept was
 
01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
Central to the cost management of the of
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
operations I hate to obsess on this
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
covered walkway issue but it's not just
 
01:25:46.590 --> 01:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
a covered sidewalk it it it is the the
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
central element that creates a shared
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
operation if if you have to go outside
 
01:25:57.310 --> 01:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
and the snow and the rain and and all of
 
01:25:59.709 --> 01:25:59.719 align:start position:0%
that it it isn't a shared operation it's
 
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
two distinct operations and we're never
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
going to get the synergies we were
 
01:26:07.149 --> 01:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
hoping for for the resources and and
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
even God forbid it is a million dollars
 
01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
extra over the cumulative effect of the
 
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:15.639 align:start position:0%
operational impact that that that would
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
have I I just really would hope that the
 
01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
managers of this project look at that
 
01:26:25.109 --> 01:26:25.119 align:start position:0%
Corridor connecting the two facilities
 
01:26:29.109 --> 01:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
as more than a covered walkway it it is
 
01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
at its core the artery that connects and
 
01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
allows the sharing of these resources
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
and and I I've just been frustrated over
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
the last 18 months that this shared
 
01:26:45.629 --> 01:26:45.639 align:start position:0%
concept is is getting knocked off a
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
center because we can't build a a
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
corridor that's appropriate to the
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
sharing concept and so that there
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
there's really not a question there but
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
but Madame commissioner if you if you
 
01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
that so I just want to clarify on the
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
shared services Personnel wasn't
 
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily one of those shared services
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
we knew that food and laundry
 
01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services um would be the
 
01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
the centralized in trying to save and
 
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
efficiencies on that I don't disagree
 
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
with you about it being the artery I
 
01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
think you knowing being part of some of
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
the design conversations there was a lot
 
01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
of discussion about what was going to be
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
the most efficient and safe place to
 
01:27:33.629 --> 01:27:33.639 align:start position:0%
actually place the facility to maximize
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
the proximity to the existing hospital
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
so that we weren't having I mean we
 
01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:39.719 align:start position:0%
started out thinking about underground
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
right we were're going to be able to do
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
that obviously that was cost prohibitive
 
01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
so we ended up with a walkway I I don't
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
disagree with you that it needs to be
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
covered I think just as a point it's
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable to think that as we go
 
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
forward and I share the conc ER to you
 
01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
and your friend who testified earlier
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
that um a million dollars is kind of
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
High um and I think that there are a lot
 
01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
of things that that that we can look at
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
as a state and and as as facility
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
managers um in terms of what we can do
 
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
with own forces and like there's a lot
 
01:28:14.109 --> 01:28:14.119 align:start position:0%
of things for the for the for the YDC DC
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
itself that you can't do with own forces
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot of things like
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
related to walkways Etc that you that
 
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
you really can do and probably a lot
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
cheaper than a than a than a
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
construction bid and we've done that in
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
other other places where there are
 
01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
things that end up being very pricey in
 
01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
a bid because that's how bids often are
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
because they look at it as part of a
 
01:28:35.229 --> 01:28:35.239 align:start position:0%
whole giant construction piece and then
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
you look at it and you're like you know
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
what we could do the carpeting in the
 
01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know I picked that randomly but
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
little things like that we could pave
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
the parking lot we could help build a
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
covered walkway Etc so I'm sure
 
01:28:48.149 --> 01:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
everybody's on board with that all right
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I appreciate
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
everyone's patience as I obsess on this
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.830 align:start position:0%
 
Senator

01:28:58.830 --> 01:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
birdell thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
taking my uh question it's going to be
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
kind of a twofold But to answer um
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I did have a
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
conversation with Justin lucer loose
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
loer um uh this week and they are also
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the walkway however
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
they are looking at various options
 
01:29:26.189 --> 01:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
including um uh a van type of truck that
 
01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
will allow um the transportation of
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
laundry and food service so that they
 
01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
don't have to use the walkway so they're
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
looking at different options for the um
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
but the thing that I'm I'm concerned
 
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
about so
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
the the amount of construction that
 
01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
we're looking at um is this just for a
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
shell and then do are they going to be
 
01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
adding on um for the the projects the
 
01:29:58.030 --> 01:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
different projects on the um on the
 
01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
YDC the the building um right um uh is
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
this 35 million or the 21 is that just
 
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
for the shell of the building to build
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
and then are they going to do ad hoc um
 
01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
no no it's a good question um the
 
01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
Construction contract will will end up
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
being the the portion with the
 
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:21.400 align:start position:0%
construction company something like 32.4
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
million and and in doing so that's to
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
build a building um it it the while the
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
bid was constructed with with 15
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
alternates which of which we took I
 
01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
think 10 and more or nine and one's a
 
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
one's a deduct alternate um you can see
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
um but uh it's the decisions were made
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
about alternates about things like the
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
covered walkway doesn't affect the I'm
 
01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
sorry I shouldn't I shouldn't go here
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
but um the covered walkway doesn't
 
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
affect the operation of the building
 
01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing would have been
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
looked at or or some things in parking
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
lots for example
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
but in terms of constructing the
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
building one of the things we we can't
 
01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
go forward with a contract that does not
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
construct a building that can be used
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
and and this is a this is we are
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
constructing a functional building
 
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
period this isn't this isn't I'm going
 
01:31:10.030 --> 01:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
to come back next year and go well we
 
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
need 10 million cuz um this is a
 
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
Construction contract a real honest to
 
01:31:18.189 --> 01:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
God done in the middle of
 
01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
2026 building my second question if I'm
 
01:31:24.750 --> 01:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
allowed um in resp respons to
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative Edward he talked about
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
the shared services um was the laundry
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy um facilities and
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
food was that given a
 
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
greater were those Services given a
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
greater uh percentage Point versus the
 
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
closest hospital the state police
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
barracks and public transportation
 
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:51.400 align:start position:0%
because that is the biggest issue that I
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
have with the YDC coming into h dead we
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
have no nearby hospital the state police
 
01:32:00.990 --> 01:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
are 30 m 30 minutes away and public
 
01:32:07.950 --> 01:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:15.149 --> 01:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
further is there an
 
01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
answer yes I think they were all
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
considered as part of the criteria I
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
don't think that one was more than the
 
01:32:23.229 --> 01:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
other they were all listed and weighed
 
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
out is what I understand from the
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
evaluation that we
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
did thank
 
01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
you Senate agree move to approve second
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
Senator gray moves to approve the item
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
Senate appr seconds item 24353 is there
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
approve I got one from representative
 
01:32:45.149 --> 01:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
Lehman then representative
 
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
Edwards thank you Mr chairman So based
 
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
on what I'm reading here you had only
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
one bid is there a reason others didn't
 
01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
bid I assume you sent out proposals to a
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
number of area contractors oh no we we
 
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
we did the whole process there was a you
 
01:33:03.629 --> 01:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
know everybody's pre-qualified and the
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know do website and all of that like
 
01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
like any other project and and some of
 
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
that is like the
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
e911 got five or six bids I forget now
 
01:33:16.270 --> 01:33:16.280 align:start position:0%
and uh which went to bid at about the
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
same time um we had I think we had six
 
01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
companies that were interested in in the
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
project and and that we thought cuz you
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
you get a sense of this right they do
 
01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
walk Etc who might bid and we had six
 
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
companies that were interested we we do
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
follow-ups with people to say why didn't
 
01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
you bid why did you bid it's a very big
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
complicated process um you know you can
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
you can make a you can make a decent
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
living on doing State work but State
 
01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
work is often very complicated um and
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes the the the more complicated
 
01:33:51.109 --> 01:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
projects um get fewer biders you know
 
01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
when we bid the forensic hospital I
 
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
think there were two biders for example
 
01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.030 align:start position:0%
think there were two biders for example
and

01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
um I mean we're really happy with that
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
that hutter bid but we talked to some of
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
the other ones and and they look at it
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
and they talk to their subs and they
 
01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
just kind of go in a different direction
 
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
they're like you know what we're going
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
to bid if I'm honest I think that there
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
were two or three biders who were
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
deciding am I going to bid uh YDC or am
 
01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
I going to bid 911 and they bid 911
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
instead um hter hutter happened to
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
actually do both um didn't win that one
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
did win this one but we're in a climate
 
01:34:27.310 --> 01:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
where uh everybody's got a lot of work
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know if you're trying to put a porch
 
01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
on the front of your house you know that
 
01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
um he said with experience um the uh and
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of work so they're
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
choosy and this is big and it's
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
complicated and and we we push risk onto
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
the contractor as people know we do
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
design bid build and you know you bid a
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
contract at 32 million you're committing
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
to build it at 32 million and and there
 
01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
aren't a lot of lot of ways around that
 
01:34:54.109 --> 01:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
and so you have to assume a lot of RK
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
and it's a big project and so people
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
look at it that way thank you uh Mr
 
01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
chairman I will be voting no along with
 
01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
Senator U
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
berdel from the start I've had problems
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
with this entire project and I just
 
01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
control representative Edwards all right
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
different different topic but kind of
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
related I've heard the commissioner and
 
01:35:26.229 --> 01:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
Senator B so uh accurately describe the
 
01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
shared services uh in in many points
 
01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
enumerating things like laundry and and
 
01:35:35.950 --> 01:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
food and and basic Logistics supplies
 
01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing but there was also
 
01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
this concept that clinical resources
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
could be shared or sharable as well by
 
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
having kind of a pediatric focus at
 
01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
Hamstead and sort of a juvenile
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
pediatric aspect at the YDC there was
 
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
certainly the thought that perhaps
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
clinical staff could be shared as well
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
particularly in some Edge situations
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
like uh emergency coverage overnight or
 
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
the weekends you know that there's some
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
way to to handle that and just having
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
the Synergy of um pediatric clinicians
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
in Hamstead and at the YDC th I'm I'm
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
hoping that there's enough clinical
 
01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
interchange and and exposure to one
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
another that that it it creates
 
01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
it creates a real shared environment and
 
01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
so so I've heard you both dismiss the
 
01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
clinical aspect of this but I I I would
 
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
hope that that wasn't
 
01:36:37.709 --> 01:36:37.719 align:start position:0%
intentional no I I wasn't intentionally
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
trying to dismiss that I mean we Ed the
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
term Children's Center of Excellence for
 
01:36:43.149 --> 01:36:43.159 align:start position:0%
being able to have a campus where we're
 
01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
able to provide services in those
 
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
facilities and the whole idea would be
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
economy of scales to be able to use the
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
resources that we have for either
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
facility as deemed appropriate
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
so that wouldn't rule out clinical and I
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
think the instances you give are good
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
M Senator
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
rosenal thank you Mr chairman will you
 
01:37:20.109 --> 01:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
potentially we can't mix the two
 
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
populations together as they're served
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't mean that we couldn't
 
01:37:27.070 --> 01:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
have teachers that teach it both but we
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
can't mix the populations together in
 
01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.030 align:start position:0%
can't mix the populations together in
one

01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:37:34.830 --> 01:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
classroom I sorry my question really was
 
01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
could the same
 
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
teachers work at both facilities
 
01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
potentially yes yes and is that
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
something you're considering we're
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
considering everything thank
 
01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
you including the
 
01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
walkway forther
 
01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
discussion virtualization
 
01:37:56.589 --> 01:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
temporary all right seeing none we have
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
a motion in a second to adopt FIS
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
24353 I'm going to ask the clerk to do a
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
roll call vote on
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
this the motion is to approve f 24
 
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:13.480 align:start position:0%

01:38:51.589 --> 01:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
Jesus motion passes and it is adopted
 
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
three 7 to three the next one we have
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
gray some observations on
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
that um this one certainly the windfall
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
needs a discussion and so uh I have made
 
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
suggestions to the commissioner uh that
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
there be some limits put on this um I
 
01:39:26.109 --> 01:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
suggested that if it was 10 million he
 
01:39:29.149 --> 01:39:29.159 align:start position:0%
come in for a limit of 15 million or if
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's 50 million he come in for a limit
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
of 75 million so that there are some
 
01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:36.350 align:start position:0%
of 75 million so that there are some
some

01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:39:39.790 --> 01:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
boundaries uh that uh if cross would
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
have to come back to fiscal in next
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
month which is the last time that we'd
 
01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
be able to to take this and I'll turn it
 
01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
over to the commissioner
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
now yes uh thank you Senator um so this
 
01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:55.719 align:start position:0%
item is designed and we refer to this as
 
01:39:58.750 --> 01:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
the waterfall item so this is what we
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
would um we use lot utilize at the end
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
of our process to make sure that we are
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
spending every last scent of the arpa
 
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
sfrf funds um and in order to do that we
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
need to be able to have enough time to
 
01:40:19.629 --> 01:40:19.639 align:start position:0%
to uh complete the process of all of the
 
01:40:22.109 --> 01:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
um items that you've discussed here over
 
01:40:24.430 --> 01:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
the last you know couple couple of years
 
01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
and most recently over the last two
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
months as we sort of closed down the
 
01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:29.990 align:start position:0%
months as we sort of closed down the
final

01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
final
 
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
reallocations um there's a process that
 
01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:36.639 align:start position:0%
goes with that so after uh you um um
 
01:40:38.589 --> 01:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
consider the accept and expend items
 
01:40:40.189 --> 01:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
those obviously have to go to Executive
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
Council and then we have to get
 
01:40:43.870 --> 01:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
contracts in place we have to have
 
01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
contracts in place in order for those
 
01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
funds to count as obligated under the
 
01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
federal deadline so uh we are rushing
 
01:40:55.589 --> 01:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
and most of my fellow Commissioners
 
01:40:57.790 --> 01:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
behind me probably are not happy with me
 
01:41:00.030 --> 01:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
at the moment but we are rushing them to
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
get these items through uh executive
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
councel hopefully at their next meeting
 
01:41:09.629 --> 01:41:09.639 align:start position:0%
but almost exclusively by their November
 
01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
I believe 14th meeting and the reason
 
01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
for that is that we do need to cons
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
continue to have a little bit of wiggle
 
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
room because these projects as you hear
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh through the voices of all of us
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
trying to administer these projects
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh have uh there are no straight lines
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
it is all very up and down and uh where
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
we might have uh an amount of money that
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
that it that um a department may say
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
they have funds available to put back
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
effectively into the till you know when
 
01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
we get two weeks into a a full review of
 
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
that with our staff and their staff it
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
might be a different number and so um
 
01:41:50.750 --> 01:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
this is designed to
 
01:41:52.669 --> 01:41:52.679 align:start position:0%
accommodate a little bit of that
 
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
ambiguity it that we reach at the end of
 
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
this process so what we did with this
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
item was we effectively recreated the
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
same uh thing that we did under car's
 
01:42:06.189 --> 01:42:06.199 align:start position:0%
act which you may recall uh we had a
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
waterfall item that at that time flowed
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
into the unemployment insurance trust
 
01:42:15.149 --> 01:42:15.159 align:start position:0%
fund um this time what we are suggesting
 
01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
and requesting is that those the the
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
remaining arpa sfrf funds would flow
 
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
into the affordable housing trust fund
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
at the new at New Hampshire housing so
 
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
any funds that would be left unobligated
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
so without Contra contracted um services
 
01:42:33.870 --> 01:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
in place uh by the end of this deadline
 
01:42:36.910 --> 01:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
we would execute an amount uh equal to
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
that that would go to um the affordable
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
housing trust fund so that is that's
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
that's the goal here uh just as a
 
01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.790 align:start position:0%
that's the goal here uh just as a
followup

01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
followup
 
01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
uh some of the Senators are not
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable with a blank checkbook yes
 
01:42:54.270 --> 01:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
okay are not comfortable with
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
if a large n amount of money is returned
 
01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
that all going to housing when in my
 
01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
opinion uh the uh deferred maintenance
 
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
of the state buildings is in terrible
 
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
shape uh we could save money you know in
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
future budgets by not having people in
 
01:43:18.270 --> 01:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
leased spaces but renovating spaces that
 
01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
we own uh and so again that's that's why
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
the concept that that I came up with was
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
the guard
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
rails there have been conversations with
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
me about people who would like to uh
 
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
table this item until next month uh but
 
01:43:39.629 --> 01:43:39.639 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we need to do that I
 
01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
think that that if you can look into
 
01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
your crystal ball and say
 
01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
well you know I'm guessing that the
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
number would be and we give you a
 
01:43:54.750 --> 01:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of money over that
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
um that we can both go home today and
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
and and be
 
01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
guesser if I I could just say one thing
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
on that I think to your point Senator uh
 
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
you know if if there were other projects
 
01:44:14.189 --> 01:44:14.199 align:start position:0%
conceivably let's say that you know we
 
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
have a big contract out there that for
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
one reason or another isn't able to be
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
executed and we have to rush something I
 
01:44:22.270 --> 01:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
mean let's just say that they that
 
01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
agency holds out you know hope until the
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
last possible moment so we're talking
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
sometime in mid December and we have
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
that project ultimately doesn't come
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
together um given you know the process
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
and the procurement and the that that we
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
would have to undertake to reassign
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
those funds um put them through this
 
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
process put them through executive
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
counsel it starts to become a real
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
challenge I I would think and I I I'm
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
just really very hesitant and super
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
focused on making sure that we don't end
 
01:44:59.550 --> 01:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
up in a situation where we don't have an
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
option and there's like let's say two or
 
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
three million dollars left on a table
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere um and then ultimately have to
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
send that back to the federal government
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's and I understand um the the
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
concern here we we did this under car's
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
act we've tried to model the same
 
01:45:21.229 --> 01:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
approach for arpa um and understand that
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
we will get to a point at the end of
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
this year when um it it's a number that
 
01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
I I I I really can't comfortably say in
 
01:45:33.589 --> 01:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
and put the state in a position if I get
 
01:45:37.149 --> 01:45:37.159 align:start position:0%
it wrong of having to um pay some money
 
01:45:38.830 --> 01:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
back to the federal government I
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.589 --> 01:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
statement Senator rosenal thank you Mr
 
01:45:50.189 --> 01:45:50.199 align:start position:0%
chairman what I what I think I've heard
 
01:45:50.199 --> 01:45:51.109 align:start position:0%
chairman what I what I think I've heard
you

01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:45:53.550 --> 01:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
say or imply
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
is that you don't believe there will be
 
01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
any more time to bring any more arpa fun
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
items to the November fiscal meeting
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
so essentially what I think I'm hearing
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
is you want to nail this down today
 
01:46:20.189 --> 01:46:20.199 align:start position:0%
without us
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
knowing how much is in that blank check
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
or I mean because the way it's
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
written it just basically says anything
 
01:46:35.070 --> 01:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
that's unobligated prior to December
 
01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:36.470 align:start position:0%
that's unobligated prior to December
31st

01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
31st
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
2024 which would mean it could come back
 
01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
next month for a vote but are are you
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
saying or implying that there will not
 
01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
be any more arpa fund requests at the
 
01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
November fiscal meeting because you
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
don't think there's time to write
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
contracts so we have to do this today a
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
couple of things there's a lot there
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
Senator I think one is I'm not aware of
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
any U items coming to the November
 
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal from arpa arpa funded projects
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
there um the the other issue in the
 
01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
scenario that you raise is that if we
 
01:47:21.589 --> 01:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
even if we put this off until November
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to know
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
what the unobligated amount is because
 
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
there still remain Council meetings as
 
01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
much as we're trying to get all of those
 
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
through there are potentially changes
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
that would occur let's say in December
 
01:47:38.229 --> 01:47:38.239 align:start position:0%
under either an existing contract or a
 
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
contract that is not yet uh been fully
 
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
executed that could change and put us in
 
01:47:47.470 --> 01:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
the position that I've been describing
 
01:47:51.149 --> 01:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
so I I understand it's a little bit of a
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
um uh an unknown
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
I I I I I could I could conceivably
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
guess that the number would be um
 
01:48:01.709 --> 01:48:01.719 align:start position:0%
probably well I don't even want to do
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
that because if one big one goes wrong
 
01:48:05.310 --> 01:48:05.320 align:start position:0%
then I'm then I've given you the wrong
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
number so I'm I'm a little bit put in a
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
tough position understandably here but
 
01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
at the same time sort of our prime
 
01:48:15.870 --> 01:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
directive is not send any money back and
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
anything that ends up um not becoming
 
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
obligated under what we've got in front
 
01:48:23.709 --> 01:48:23.719 align:start position:0%
of you um would end up
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
um providing more resources to solve the
 
01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
the housing crisis and it would be for
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
affordable housing in New Hampshire so
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a it's a bit of a
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
um tough
 
01:48:42.189 --> 01:48:42.199 align:start position:0%
situation follow up you I remember the
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
cares act waterfall item and you did
 
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
know the number then it was like $50
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
million um
 
01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that neighborhood it was
 
01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:56.709 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that neighborhood it was
really

01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:56.719 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
big how is it that you knew in
 
01:49:03.709 --> 01:49:03.719 align:start position:0%
advance that
 
01:49:07.229 --> 01:49:07.239 align:start position:0%
number but you don't think you're going
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
to know this number I I I would I would
 
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
I would say that we at that time in my
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
memory of this Senator is that we did
 
01:49:20.669 --> 01:49:20.679 align:start position:0%
not know the uh the final number we we
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
were I I vividly remember running
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
numbers and calculations with the goer
 
01:49:30.350 --> 01:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
staff on Christmas Eve um on what those
 
01:49:32.189 --> 01:49:32.199 align:start position:0%
numbers would be as we reach toward the
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
end of that cares act deadline you might
 
01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
be recalling that we did have separate
 
01:49:40.589 --> 01:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
items under cares act under the CRF that
 
01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
went directly to the uh unemployment
 
01:49:46.709 --> 01:49:46.719 align:start position:0%
insurance trust fund uh specific
 
01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
obligations but my memory would be that
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
we did not know the final water fall
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
number until we got fre it was right
 
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
around Christmas time in of 2000 or
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
2020 Senator Pearl for a
 
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
01:50:06.669 --> 01:50:06.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner you know the affordable
 
01:50:09.189 --> 01:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
housing fund is certainly a uh a a
 
01:50:11.470 --> 01:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
notable place to put this I guess my
 
01:50:13.229 --> 01:50:13.239 align:start position:0%
question is it possible that this
 
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
waterfall could spill into more than one
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
pool I mean you can design a waterfall
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
any any way that you would like I think
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
we did discuss having some
 
01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
some multiple places but it just uh it
 
01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
just amplifies the problem that we're
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
talking about which is how much is it a
 
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
percentage is it an amount like and then
 
01:50:36.030 --> 01:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
you have to have separate contracts and
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
um it just seems simpler to say if you
 
01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
know if we make it if we certainly see
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
both in my gopher life and my Bea life
 
01:50:48.030 --> 01:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
that the housing crisis is probably near
 
01:50:50.189 --> 01:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
the top of the issues and we've tried
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
and we've invested a good amount of
 
01:50:55.149 --> 01:50:55.159 align:start position:0%
money of ARA funds into that issue um
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
that at the very end that would be
 
01:50:59.790 --> 01:50:59.800 align:start position:0%
probably one of the most effective
 
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
places to put that final amount of that
 
01:51:04.109 --> 01:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
we just don't know what that number is
 
01:51:07.470 --> 01:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
right now um and and and accomplish an
 
01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
important goal for the state thank
 
01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
discussion um s agre if I could get uh
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
Mr Arling housee up to the the thing cuz
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
I do want to talk about deferred
 
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance I mean
 
01:51:30.069 --> 01:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
um we were discussing other things
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday and uh I believe that there
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
are contracts out there that uh arpa
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
money could be put forward for um and if
 
01:51:44.430 --> 01:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
those were to come forward next month
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
then I would be less hesitant to give
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
you the blank check for the rest of it
 
01:51:53.709 --> 01:51:53.719 align:start position:0%
if we could make some kind of
 
01:51:56.069 --> 01:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
Arrangement you know that those those
 
01:51:57.629 --> 01:51:57.639 align:start position:0%
items would be considered to come
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
forward for at least part of this money
 
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
that would have gone in to the
 
01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
waterfall so I so desperately want to
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to say yes to this um
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
but I let me let me walk through um
 
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
because we haven't talked about this the
 
01:52:17.069 --> 01:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
the challenge
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
um in in the in the one big the
 
01:52:22.350 --> 01:52:22.360 align:start position:0%
governor's arpa item that he talked
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
about about there are two things that
 
01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
that that are coming to us for for
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance type issues and there are
 
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
two things the one is the State House
 
01:52:30.990 --> 01:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
bathrooms I'm going to use that as an
 
01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
example we have a contract for State
 
01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:33.990 align:start position:0%
example we have a contract for State
House

01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
House
 
01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
bathrooms I have to figure out a way to
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
amend the contract on some ridiculous
 
01:52:42.669 --> 01:52:42.679 align:start position:0%
timeline Taylor's giving me um but in a
 
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
nice way um and um but what we're going
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
to do is go Oh wait we're doing
 
01:52:48.990 --> 01:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
bathrooms we already have a contract to
 
01:52:50.109 --> 01:52:50.119 align:start position:0%
do bathrooms we're doing this many
 
01:52:51.149 --> 01:52:51.159 align:start position:0%
bathrooms we're just going to add the
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
other ones to it okay that works we can
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
do that that makes sense I have a number
 
01:52:57.310 --> 01:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
I can negotiate a number we don't have
 
01:52:59.310 --> 01:52:59.320 align:start position:0%
to do drawings we don't have to do
 
01:53:01.229 --> 01:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
additional design work so good we're
 
01:53:02.589 --> 01:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
doing some things with the with the
 
01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
annex renovation the same way and it's
 
01:53:07.709 --> 01:53:07.719 align:start position:0%
you got a guy um gutting things for his
 
01:53:09.069 --> 01:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
bestest he's going to got more things
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
for his bestest for for a lot of other
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
things and God knows there's enough I I
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
said to somebody when they asked our
 
01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance list if we really
 
01:53:19.790 --> 01:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
did one that was accurate would be
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
something like a billion dollarss um
 
01:53:26.109 --> 01:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
and um somebody corrected me when I said
 
01:53:28.229 --> 01:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
that and they said I think we're I think
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
only between 8 and 900 million but
 
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
whatever it is there's there's a lot we
 
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
could do um the problem is I would then
 
01:53:38.069 --> 01:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
have to I'd have to scope the work
 
01:53:40.109 --> 01:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
design the contract go back and forth
 
01:53:42.270 --> 01:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
with with the contractor you know called
 
01:53:44.589 --> 01:53:44.599 align:start position:0%
like Turnstone is doing this go back and
 
01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
forth with them then get it through doj
 
01:53:50.589 --> 01:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
then get it to the governor and council
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
meeting I got an i if they have a second
 
01:53:54.910 --> 01:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
meeting in December I would have an
 
01:53:56.990 --> 01:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
outside shot of hitting that if we could
 
01:53:58.430 --> 01:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
pick a really good
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
item the the problem is I don't I don't
 
01:54:06.189 --> 01:54:06.199 align:start position:0%
have a have a a a parking lot a a fund I
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
mean I have a I have a deferred
 
01:54:09.589 --> 01:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund right we we have that
 
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
in the state it it's not obligated in a
 
01:54:16.830 --> 01:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
in an arpa pleasing way arpa you have to
 
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
have a a contract with a vendor and so I
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
can't I could probably find a couple
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
things where we could like like nudge a
 
01:54:26.830 --> 01:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
contract a little bit for a mill for a
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
few million here and there but it would
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
be less about
 
01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
doing one of the things you said to me
 
01:54:35.669 --> 01:54:35.679 align:start position:0%
when we talked yesterday that that
 
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
struck me is one of the things you're
 
01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
looking to do is to is to do things that
 
01:54:42.189 --> 01:54:42.199 align:start position:0%
if we don't do them with arpa funds for
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
example we would have to do them in the
 
01:54:45.629 --> 01:54:45.639 align:start position:0%
capital budget or we would have to do
 
01:54:48.750 --> 01:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
them particularly the operating budget I
 
01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
I think I would be reduced because of
 
01:54:53.669 --> 01:54:53.679 align:start position:0%
because of the timing because it's late
 
01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
October right now um I would be reduced
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
to doing things that aren't my top
 
01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
priorities but worth doing or we would
 
01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
quote unquote buy a building and I'm not
 
01:55:05.790 --> 01:55:05.800 align:start position:0%
sure anybody really wants to buy any
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
more buildings I certainly don't does
 
01:55:09.589 --> 01:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
that make
 
01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
sense I mean I I I want God knows I want
 
01:55:15.629 --> 01:55:15.639 align:start position:0%
the money I really do but I I just don't
 
01:55:17.589 --> 01:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
think I can make it work on the time
 
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
it's because we have a 12:31
 
01:55:22.709 --> 01:55:22.719 align:start position:0%
timetable certainly I understand you
 
01:55:25.870 --> 01:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
know what you've told me um certainly
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
that things that I can put money into
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
for deferred maintenance that doesn't
 
01:55:32.830 --> 01:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
come out of the general fund is where I
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
want to go uh but I'm also not
 
01:55:39.310 --> 01:55:39.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable with an open-ended you know
 
01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
waterfall that I have no idea whether
 
01:55:46.030 --> 01:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
it's you know 20 million 100 million 200
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
million either and so I'm kind of left
 
01:55:53.470 --> 01:55:53.480 align:start position:0%
between the rocking hard places they say
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
where I need to support putting that
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
money somewhere where it's going to be
 
01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
useful but I've got other places other
 
01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:04.669 align:start position:0%
useful but I've got other places other
than

01:56:04.669 --> 01:56:04.679 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
housing if there is significant money
 
01:56:10.510 --> 01:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
that I would like to see those things
 
01:56:11.950 --> 01:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
taken care of
 
01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
also so I don't disagree Senator and
 
01:56:17.790 --> 01:56:17.800 align:start position:0%
trust me I I spend more time
 
01:56:19.310 --> 01:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately telling a lot of people
 
01:56:21.629 --> 01:56:21.639 align:start position:0%
that we may not have resources than I do
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
telling people that we do that have
 
01:56:26.430 --> 01:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
requested funds so um there is
 
01:56:28.510 --> 01:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
definitely that component to it but as
 
01:56:31.310 --> 01:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner Arling house points out we
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
we are at a point in time where it is
 
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
really really difficult for us to be
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
able to move funds um that we're still
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
not 100% sure that we would have into a
 
01:56:44.589 --> 01:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
project that then had to go through a
 
01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
normal process I mean you have one more
 
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
meeting in fiscal committee uh we have
 
01:56:51.629 --> 01:56:51.639 align:start position:0%
just a handful of meetings left under
 
01:56:53.950 --> 01:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
executive Council all of which we need
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
to have full approval from um and in the
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
case of accept an expend request twice
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know once once here and once there
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
um and uh it just gets to be um a timing
 
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.189 --> 01:57:18.199 align:start position:0%
discussion the
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
um I will make a little statement before
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
I move item uh certainly I would like to
 
01:57:27.709 --> 01:57:27.719 align:start position:0%
see a commitment anything that we can
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
move uh if there is additional funds so
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
that we could make a decision in the
 
01:57:35.950 --> 01:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
November meeting whether or not that
 
01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
should go into the wall uh the waterfall
 
01:57:41.069 --> 01:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
or whether or not it's something that we
 
01:57:43.629 --> 01:57:43.639 align:start position:0%
would like to do uh certainly this
 
01:57:47.950 --> 01:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
motion doesn't preclude that um so I as
 
01:57:50.069 --> 01:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
I said before I think I'm between a rock
 
01:57:53.149 --> 01:57:53.159 align:start position:0%
and a hard place and I got to support
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
this item because it needs support uh
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
but behind the scenes I think there are
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
things that we can do uh to push things
 
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
into that November
 
01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
meeting um if there is significant money
 
01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
that that needs to be done so I will
 
01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
move the
 
01:58:14.189 --> 01:58:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%

almost good afternoon
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
Senator always good day Jorge it's good
 
01:59:31.709 --> 01:59:31.719 align:start position:0%
to see you Senator you know how I love
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
to talk about energy I do I do so um two
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
questions if I could Mr
 
01:59:43.950 --> 01:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
chairman um when that my understanding
 
01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
which um
 
02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
allowed the fund to be used for the
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
office of wind industry development and
 
02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:05.270 align:start position:0%
office of wind industry development and
energy

02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:00:09.550 --> 02:00:09.560 align:start position:0%
Innovation at the time the department
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
testified that they would not need any
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
more funds so I guess my first question
 
02:00:21.069 --> 02:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
is you told us in the spring you could
 
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
do it within existing budget why can't
 
02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
you and then I have another question
 
02:00:29.310 --> 02:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
sure happy to answer that question um
 
02:00:30.750 --> 02:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
first for the record Josh Elliot
 
02:00:32.109 --> 02:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
director of the division of policy and
 
02:00:34.550 --> 02:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
programs with the Department of energy
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
um as this bill has went made its way
 
02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
through the process um the original
 
02:00:42.629 --> 02:00:42.639 align:start position:0%
contemplation was to fund the um a
 
02:00:44.109 --> 02:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
position that would Encompass all of
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
these duties um through federal funds um
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
we have a program called the state
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
energy program that um essentially it's
 
02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
a Federal Grant in order to um Most
 
02:00:55.069 --> 02:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
states use it to provide staff their
 
02:00:56.669 --> 02:00:56.679 align:start position:0%
their energy
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
offices um the uh approval of the
 
02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
original effective date had been pushed
 
02:01:04.030 --> 02:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
out I believe for two years originally
 
02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
um and then this idea sort of came
 
02:01:09.069 --> 02:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
through um uh through the legislature of
 
02:01:11.069 --> 02:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
okay what if we move these duties within
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
this existing office and change it from
 
02:01:15.390 --> 02:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
the office of offshore wind and Industry
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
to the office of originally the office
 
02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
of um uh energy Innovation period and
 
02:01:22.669 --> 02:01:22.679 align:start position:0%
included all these duties but attained
 
02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
the original duties um based on uh RSA
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
I'm looking here um RSA 362 F10 Roman
 
02:01:33.470 --> 02:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
one um allows the agency I'm Sorry by
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
moving it within um that office uh
 
02:01:39.069 --> 02:01:39.079 align:start position:0%
allowed it to be then funded out of the
 
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund one of the uses of
 
02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund um there's a
 
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
whole series um as know we went through
 
02:01:47.229 --> 02:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
this in the dedicated funds committee U
 
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
meeting earlier this month um includes
 
02:01:54.669 --> 02:01:54.679 align:start position:0%
this office um with the move of these
 
02:01:57.790 --> 02:01:57.800 align:start position:0%
duties into the into that office um the
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund then became an
 
02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
option to um fund this position rather
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
than using um repurposing federal funds
 
02:02:10.270 --> 02:02:10.280 align:start position:0%
um that um would have uh excuse me
 
02:02:12.069 --> 02:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
repurchasing federal funds and then
 
02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
going through the state budget process
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
in order to um create that position go
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
through that whole that whole process it
 
02:02:20.069 --> 02:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
would come before um House and Senate
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
Finance committees um so given that the
 
02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh legislature moved this into the
 
02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund this option
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
through the statute to come before this
 
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
committee um to create and fund that
 
02:02:33.069 --> 02:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
position was given
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
instead follow I guess I have two more
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
questions right so the second one is um
 
02:02:42.270 --> 02:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
so um RSA
 
02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:44.149 align:start position:0%
so um RSA
362

02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
362
 
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
F4 defines what renewable energy is and
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy whether it's good bad or
 
02:02:56.990 --> 02:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
indifferent is not included in the
 
02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
definition of renewable energy
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
so how does the department
 
02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
justify funding a
 
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
nuclear uh project analyst out of the
 
02:03:14.910 --> 02:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund thank you for the
 
02:03:17.229 --> 02:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
question um so this office of energy
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
Innovation or offshore wind and Industry
 
02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
and energy Innovation is sort of more of
 
02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
a uh all-encompassing sort of office
 
02:03:25.470 --> 02:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be looking at a number of
 
02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
other things including battery storage
 
02:03:28.510 --> 02:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
things like that there are green
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
hydrogen all those sort of innovative
 
02:03:31.629 --> 02:03:31.639 align:start position:0%
things I'm not going to touch the land
 
02:03:33.790 --> 02:03:33.800 align:start position:0%
mine as to whether or not nuclear is
 
02:03:35.470 --> 02:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
renewable depending on who you talk to
 
02:03:37.149 --> 02:03:37.159 align:start position:0%
there's very strong opinions about that
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
so um and probably of no consequence to
 
02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
this committee uh so that being said um
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
the statute itself um allows the funding
 
02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
of this entire office and puts those
 
02:03:52.589 --> 02:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
duties of those of these specific duties
 
02:03:54.669 --> 02:03:54.679 align:start position:0%
regarding nuclear into that office that
 
02:03:56.669 --> 02:03:56.679 align:start position:0%
office itself is funded out of the
 
02:03:58.549 --> 02:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund so that is that is
 
02:03:58.559 --> 02:04:00.310 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund so that is that is
the

02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
connection thank you well um maybe some
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
people think it's renewable but New
 
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statutes Say It Isn't So
 
02:04:18.069 --> 02:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to rethink our statutes if
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
you want nuclear energy to be CL
 
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
classified as renewable but my last
 
02:04:29.629 --> 02:04:29.639 align:start position:0%
question is what um what kind of budget
 
02:04:32.589 --> 02:04:32.599 align:start position:0%
for this office is the department going
 
02:04:37.149 --> 02:04:37.159 align:start position:0%
to come in with for next
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
budget um that is a good uh that is a
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
good question I don't have the answer
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head I can get you the
 
02:04:45.229 --> 02:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
answer for that um just to give you a
 
02:04:47.229 --> 02:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
sense um it is an office of uh if this
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
item was approved it would be an office
 
02:04:52.109 --> 02:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
of two would be one an office of two
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%

have
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
the report the
 
02:08:11.109 --> 02:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
analyses colal control review is that
 
02:08:13.390 --> 02:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
correct are are you going to talk about
 
02:08:15.149 --> 02:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
there informational items I believe
 
02:08:17.629 --> 02:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
repres item that anybody has a question
 
02:08:21.310 --> 02:08:21.320 align:start position:0%
on Senator representative Edwards uh yes
 
02:08:24.549 --> 02:08:24.559 align:start position:0%
sir I I wanted to mention um the uh the
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
operating statistics dashboard that is
 
02:08:28.830 --> 02:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh item
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
345 um the the governor when he was here
 
02:08:33.270 --> 02:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
earlier and then I think the
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh both emphasized in their
 
02:08:38.109 --> 02:08:38.119 align:start position:0%
discussions today the importance of
 
02:08:41.910 --> 02:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
mission zero and I I don't know who has
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
the authority to modify the dashboard
 
02:08:47.910 --> 02:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
report but I think it would be a a good
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
idea if the department has the authority
 
02:08:52.229 --> 02:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
to do it on their own
 
02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
is to create a little visual information
 
02:08:58.149 --> 02:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
so that uh the legislature and other
 
02:09:03.229 --> 02:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
stakeholders were able to easily see our
 
02:09:06.030 --> 02:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
history and progress on complying with
 
02:09:09.229 --> 02:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
our mission zero objectives so so that's
 
02:09:11.709 --> 02:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
my request to the department I think if
 
02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
they have the authority to add that to
 
02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
the dashboard that they do
 
02:09:18.549 --> 02:09:18.559 align:start position:0%
that uh Nathan white Chief Financial
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
Officer thank you representative Edwards
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
um the the dashboard is uh elective it
 
02:09:28.109 --> 02:09:28.119 align:start position:0%
is uh done at the will and discretion of
 
02:09:29.709 --> 02:09:29.719 align:start position:0%
the commissioner it's always been used
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
as an informational item for the
 
02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
committee just to provide updates so
 
02:09:35.189 --> 02:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
there's no statutory or administrative
 
02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
rule restrictions around what goes in or
 
02:09:39.229 --> 02:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
what goes out I can take that back I can
 
02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
talk to the commissioner about it um if
 
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
if we do move towards doing that there
 
02:09:47.189 --> 02:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
will be probably a multi-month delay
 
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
because November's fiscal items are
 
02:09:51.149 --> 02:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
basically due in a couple of days uh
 
02:09:53.669 --> 02:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
just due to the long process there um
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
but I will take that back and we will
 
02:09:57.069 --> 02:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
have discussions to figure out what how
 
02:09:59.350 --> 02:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
to best represent that information so
 
02:10:01.629 --> 02:10:01.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate it all right thanks for
 
02:10:03.950 --> 02:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
considering and educating me about who
 
02:10:06.109 --> 02:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
has the authority to modify that report
 
02:10:09.109 --> 02:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
I didn't I didn't know that so so I I I
 
02:10:11.229 --> 02:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
do think it's such an important topic to
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
the state uh and to the uh doj even uh
 
02:10:17.549 --> 02:10:17.559 align:start position:0%
that we we communicate how we're doing
 
02:10:20.430 --> 02:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
on this really important process thank
 
02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:22.950 align:start position:0%

were
 
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
unresolved this concludes my
 
02:19:48.830 --> 02:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
presentation I'd like to thank Nina
 
02:19:51.389 --> 02:19:51.399 align:start position:0%
Gardner chair of the judicial Council
 
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
Jay Bucky executive director and the
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
staff of the judicial Council for their

02:19:57.520 --> 02:19:58.750 align:start position:0%
cooperation and assistance throughout
the

02:19:58.750 --> 02:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
audit we're happy to answer any
 
02:20:02.910 --> 02:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee now or we
 
02:20:04.270 --> 02:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
could turn it over to the judicial
 
02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
Council for any comments that they may
 
02:20:09.309 --> 02:20:09.319 align:start position:0%
have thank you questions from
 
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
committee sen Grace uh certainly I'm
 
02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
02:20:19.230 --> 02:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
knowing um about uh 20141
 
02:20:23.710 --> 02:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
20142 those items and I guess it's
 
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
20144 and also in the recommendations
 
02:20:30.670 --> 02:20:30.680 align:start position:0%
where it says judicial action or I
 
02:20:33.790 --> 02:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
should say legislative action uh who is
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
going to be responsible for contacting
 
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
somebody because the filing period in
 
02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
the house is almost over but we have one
 
02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
in November there'll be one in November
 
02:20:47.230 --> 02:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
so I will be submitting
 
02:20:49.550 --> 02:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
legislation anybody on the on the
 
02:20:51.389 --> 02:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
committee wishes to co sponsor I will
 
02:20:53.630 --> 02:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
put you down as a
 
02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:55.270 align:start position:0%
put you down as a
co-sponsor

02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
02:20:57.790 --> 02:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
and the status of the ones that weren't
 
02:20:59.670 --> 02:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
resolved from
 
02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:04.550 align:start position:0%
resolved from
2014

02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:09.070 --> 02:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
yes lucky certainly in addressing in
 
02:21:13.510 --> 02:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
2014 number one um we are one of the
 
02:21:15.429 --> 02:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
agencies that has been referenced
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
earlier today that is scrambling to um
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
encumber Federal funds uh we secured
 
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
funding for a uh database uh replacement
 
02:21:28.990 --> 02:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
we have um we are working with a vendor
 
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
currently and we are hoping to have
 
02:21:32.190 --> 02:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
those funds encumbered by the end of the
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
year um we're currently in the process
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
of Simply going back and forth uh with
 
02:21:38.950 --> 02:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
the vendor to finalize contract terms so
 
02:21:41.230 --> 02:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly optimistic that we will
 
02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
reach the deadline of the end of this
 
02:21:44.230 --> 02:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
year to encumber those funds and to
 
02:21:46.349 --> 02:21:46.359 align:start position:0%
reach that Milestone I I agree with the
 
02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
audit finding that the database
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
certainly needs to be replaced I think
 
02:21:52.630 --> 02:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
that replacing the database will yield a
 
02:21:53.910 --> 02:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
lot of benefits not just for the
 
02:21:56.190 --> 02:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
judicial Council quite frankly but for
 
02:21:57.790 --> 02:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch as well I think it's
 
02:22:00.550 --> 02:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
going to be a real uh cost savings for
 
02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:02.510 align:start position:0%
going to be a real uh cost savings for
both

02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
agencies and two
 
02:22:09.070 --> 02:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
yes um again we concur with this
 
02:22:11.630 --> 02:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh currently to to meet
 
02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
this recommendation what I have set up
 
02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
with nhpd is to regularize regularize
 
02:22:20.270 --> 02:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
the uh meetings with them to go over
 
02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:21.190 align:start position:0%
the uh meetings with them to go over
their

02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
to go over um steps they have taken to
 
02:22:25.150 --> 02:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
comply with audits they've had done and
 
02:22:27.349 --> 02:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
just to Simply um set up a regular time
 
02:22:30.150 --> 02:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
and to document that um to make sure
 
02:22:31.710 --> 02:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
that it's getting done not simply on an
 
02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
ad hoc basis but that it's formalized
 
02:22:36.070 --> 02:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
regularized and that something that we
 
02:22:38.429 --> 02:22:38.439 align:start position:0%
can come back and show progress on uh at
 
02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
at our next audit
 
02:22:42.910 --> 02:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
check-in and item number three at least
 
02:22:46.349 --> 02:22:46.359 align:start position:0%
you've uh done partial on that but item
 
02:22:50.110 --> 02:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
four again is there's no dots filled in
 
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:56.790 --> 02:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
correct audit 4 no steps have been taken
 
02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
on that yet quite frankly uh at least in
 
02:23:02.349 --> 02:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
my view and I I'm happy to take feedback
 
02:23:05.070 --> 02:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
I view the other items those are sort of
 
02:23:06.590 --> 02:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
those are my priorities currently to get
 
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
those done as soon as possible because
 
02:23:11.710 --> 02:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
nhpd is our largest contractor the
 
02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
database is very time sensitive So
 
02:23:15.790 --> 02:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
currently my focuses on those two and
 
02:23:17.710 --> 02:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
then I certainly concur with that
 
02:23:19.550 --> 02:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation that that uh RIS risk
 
02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:27.389 --> 02:23:27.399 align:start position:0%
well and you expect to have those all of
 
02:23:30.550 --> 02:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
those items uh completed
 
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
right correct uh 10 years since the last
 
02:23:41.349 --> 02:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
audit um I I can only say I I only took
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
over at this agency in November of last
 
02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
year um so I can't speak to what
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
happened before then but um I think I
 
02:23:49.630 --> 02:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
outlined in my responses the times that
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
I thought that these various uh
 
02:23:52.950 --> 02:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
Milestones could be reached and we're
 
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
certainly going to work aggressively um
 
02:23:56.670 --> 02:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
towards meeting all the recommendations
 
02:23:59.030 --> 02:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
in the audit um and I I should also take
 
02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to thank the staff of
 
02:24:03.429 --> 02:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
the LBA Mr La rier um and the time they
 
02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
spent at our office working with us and
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
they've been responsive when I've had
 
02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
questions about how to meet some of
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
their recommendations they've been
 
02:24:10.990 --> 02:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
helpful and forthcoming on making those
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
suggestions and helping us move forward
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
with meeting those recommendations and
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee will expect
 
02:24:19.510 --> 02:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
progress reports as you complete these
 
02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
items sir
 
02:24:22.469 --> 02:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
well certainly that's one of the things
 
02:24:24.750 --> 02:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
that I've discussed with LBA in the past
 
02:24:27.990 --> 02:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
on these things is that I don't see a
 
02:24:32.190 --> 02:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
lot of oversight on audit findings and
 
02:24:35.469 --> 02:24:35.479 align:start position:0%
how you know in my prior life I would
 
02:24:37.349 --> 02:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
expect that every audit item would have
 
02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
a a plan of action Milestone and
 
02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
Reporting out on delinquencies and all
 
02:24:44.190 --> 02:24:44.200 align:start position:0%
of that other stuff we don't have that
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
here in the state I understand that okay
 
02:24:50.710 --> 02:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
but there ought to be some kind of
 
02:24:54.510 --> 02:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
review at some point that says you know
 
02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
I had this audit I've still got these
 
02:24:59.550 --> 02:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
items uh and nothing has happened or
 
02:25:02.429 --> 02:25:02.439 align:start position:0%
something has happened since so just a
 
02:25:06.190 --> 02:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
you representative Earth for a motion oh
 
02:25:13.230 --> 02:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
we don't need to was that was
 
02:25:16.110 --> 02:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
pre-released oh it's already been made
 
02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay dat of next meeting U Mr Buck Bucky
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
leave me some contact information so
 
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
when I work on the legislation I can be
 
02:25:26.309 --> 02:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
in touch
 
02:25:28.910 --> 02:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
certainly believe that the next meeting
 
02:25:30.990 --> 02:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
has really already been scheduled it has
 
02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:32.830 align:start position:0%
has really already been scheduled it has
November

02:25:32.830 --> 02:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
November
 
02:25:36.429 --> 02:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
15th any further items to come before us
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Kane ask Mr Kane a question Mr Kane
 
02:25:42.190 --> 02:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
are there any audits expected the next
 
02:25:44.389 --> 02:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
month that we should pre-release there
 
02:25:46.429 --> 02:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
may be one but your motion at the last
 
02:25:50.349 --> 02:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
meeting would take November as well yes
 
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
we we already made a motion on the
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
cafer no that would if there's an
 
02:25:57.469 --> 02:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
extension or release request uh that
 
02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
would come at the November meeting so
 
02:26:02.110 --> 02:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
you should see that on the 15th very
 
02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:10.670 --> 02:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
