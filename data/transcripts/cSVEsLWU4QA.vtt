00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
of the wall because i learned there's 20
 
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
of you usually in most committees and
 
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
there's only five of us so you get a
 
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
much broader view of everything and it's
 
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 align:start position:0%

we are surrounded by lebels uh zorvino's
 
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
flag hill winery so if you ever have a
 
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
free weekend you could do a nice wine
 
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
tour and um and that doesn't mean you
 
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 align:start position:0%

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.229 align:start position:0%

smith

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
smith
 
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
um anyways but i'm here today to
 
00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
introduce the charity protection act
 
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
so what the idea is you asked me
 
00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
representative smith so i'll start with
 
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
your question and see if i can help you
 
00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 align:start position:0%
representatives of the charitable
 
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
foundations came to me and said
 
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
all across the country were getting over
 
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.949 align:start position:0%
all across the country were getting over
regulated

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
we have no problems especially with
 
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state or the charitable
 
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
trust division
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
we're fine with the regulations they
 
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.990 align:start position:0%
we're fine with the regulations they
have

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 align:start position:0%
but around the country we're getting
 
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
onerously burdened by too much paperwork
 
00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 align:start position:0%
and it's requiring more staff to very
 
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
more attention
 
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
and it's not a problem with what they
 
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
have on file it's just because certain
 
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
states especially all around the country
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
are now saying
 
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
we want more we want more and so it's a
 
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
never-ending battle especially for
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
summer with certain charities there
 
00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
seems to be certain charities that
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
certain states are going against and so
 
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
we don't want that to happen in new
 
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire and again in new hampshire
 
00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
everything's running fine they want to
 
00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 align:start position:0%
be regulated by
 
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
the charitable trust division they don't
 
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
mind the paperwork
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
and again however all around the country
 
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
their vet which are becoming burdensome
 
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
on these charities and their primary
 
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
task is helping us
 
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
with the people most in need we want as
 
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
much of their resource sources going to
 
00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire and helping
 
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
the people who need our aid and not
 
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
going to unduly burdensome
 
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
tasks of paperwork and that's why i
 
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
passed when it was presented to me that
 
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
way it seemed like a relatively
 
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
and i welcome any questions there are
 
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
experts who are going to testify who i'm
 
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
more of a jack of all trades who knows a
 
00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
little bit about of a lot of bills in
 
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
the senate um but i will try to ask
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
answer any questions especially yours
 
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
other questions for the senator
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
represent representative smith
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
taking my question i've listened
 
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
carefully to what you said and you
 
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
talked about all kinds of agencies in
 
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
other states
 
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
doing draconian things to
 
00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
charitable agencies
 
00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
but this bill prohibits new hampshire
 
00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
state agencies and officials from
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
imposing filing or reporting
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
requirements it says nothing about what
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
other states are doing can you clarify
 
00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:45.670 align:start position:0%
other states are doing can you clarify
that

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
to me i think i can um so the problem is
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire where things are
 
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
relatively fine now we do not other
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
states have been overly burdensome on
 
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
many charities throughout the country we
 
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
don't want it's we're gonna head that
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
off here we're happy with the
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
requirements they're asking for now
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
under under a different administration
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
we just wanted it to be at a level
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
playing field that they're not going to
 
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden say
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
more more more so they have to hire
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
staff to do that it's just a
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative mclean
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
these other states that are
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
throwing on all these additional
 
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.230 align:start position:0%
throwing on all these additional
regulations

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
what's what's the driver behind that in
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
those other states um what concerns
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
are kind of pushing that and are we not
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
seeing those concerns in new hampshire
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
um so just trying to understand we
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
haven't as of yet
 
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
it's political concerns towards certain
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
groups certain charities that are maybe
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
not politically in favor be it um
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
you could either side of like a life
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
issue they may be pro-life they may be
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
anti and they'd be maybe tougher on one
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
group than another group and
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's just uh that's just one could be
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
one area
 
00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:05.990 align:start position:0%
one area
and

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
we want everyone on a level playing
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
field in new hampshire which we feel
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
they are and we think this is just going
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
to set parameters and keep it the way it
 
00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:15.670 align:start position:0%
to set parameters and keep it the way it
is

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative horgan did you have a
 
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.550 align:start position:0%
representative horgan did you have a
question

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
yes there was um
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
and of course we've had a one of the
 
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
one of the groups that uh sent us an
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
email opposing this was a group that
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
sends us emails on many other uh
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
political issues and um
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
which is in fact uh state director is
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
the former chief of staff for a former
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
republican speaker of the house so we
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
all know who it is and i don't want to
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
attack him he's within his rights doing
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
what he's doing but
 
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.790 align:start position:0%
what he's doing but
um

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
do we
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
are you trying to prevent us from doing
 
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
anything about and they're they're both
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%
on the left and the right and everywhere
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
in between these groups that are in fact
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
political advocacy groups but for
 
00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:03.670 align:start position:0%
political advocacy groups but for
um

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
various reasons mostly taxes and privacy
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
choose to structure themselves as 501 c
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
3s even though they're not
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
even though they're
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
i don't know if if the question was are
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
we protecting or the left to the right
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
no we want them all treated the same
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i misunderstood your question
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
that yeah but
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
do we
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
want to follow up is there some extent
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
do we want regardless of what side their
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
advocacy is on do is
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
do we have the state of any interest in
 
00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.589 align:start position:0%
do we have the state of any interest in
perhaps

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
encouraging groups like that to be
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
political epic to be something other
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
claim to be something other than a
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
you're getting into the area of politics
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much have a
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
actually this is rare we have two
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
i guarantee there are three over there
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.990 align:start position:0%
right now
and

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
senator again and i will join them very
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
shortly because we've got a lot of bills
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
that came over recently
 
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman i'm jay kahn uh
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%

the
 
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.110 align:start position:0%
the
uh

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
i'll just convey as a short story and uh
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
attorney donovan will uh correct it once
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
i'm done
 
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.670 align:start position:0%
i'm done
but

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
i don't think a year ago you saw a bill
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
that i'd introduced
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
financial audit would be required of
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
at the time i was working with
 
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.389 align:start position:0%
at the time i was working with
the

00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:31.430 align:start position:0%
the
uh

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
not-for-profits organizations within the
 
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.030 align:start position:0%
not-for-profits organizations within the
state

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
to try to see
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
if a million-dollar level
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
and this is what's uh in
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
the end of the bill in section three
 
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.829 align:start position:0%
the end of the bill in section three
um

00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
if a million dollar level is the right
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
level still
 
00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:50.870 align:start position:0%
level still
after

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
the last time that this was uh
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
updated which i think was in 2004 but
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
attorney donovan
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
has the the right figures
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
on that 2004.
 
00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:06.389 align:start position:0%
on that 2004.
anyway

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
we we uh
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
the organ the
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
conversation with the organizations
 
00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:13.990 align:start position:0%
conversation with the organizations
was

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.030 align:start position:0%
was
uh

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
do we lift the level from 1 million
 
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.870 align:start position:0%
do we lift the level from 1 million
to

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere up to 5 million dollars
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
there are about
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
700 organizations that
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
i actually know it's around 450
 
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.710 align:start position:0%
i actually know it's around 450
organizations

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
have annual revenues and expenses uh at
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
and there are about 120
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
have revenues between 1 million and 2
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
so the proposal here
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
to raise it to 2 million would be the
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
first raising of that level since 2004.
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
it covers
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
about 150
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
not for profits
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
that then would not be doing uh
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
financial st audits
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
they would still be submitting their 990
 
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.269 align:start position:0%
they would still be submitting their 990
forms

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
forms
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
like all not-for-profits do to
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
the division of charitable trusts
 
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.389 align:start position:0%
the division of charitable trusts
and

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:27.750 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
ability to continue to do audits
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
is would rest with the organization
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
at that two million dollar level it
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
becomes required on an annual basis
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
so here's the difference that this makes
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
as has been explained to me by the 1
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
million organizations
 
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.350 align:start position:0%
million organizations
and

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's that
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
they're spending about 15 000
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
a year on
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh the preparation of the
 
00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:57.750 align:start position:0%
uh the preparation of the
uh

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive audit
 
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.269 align:start position:0%
comprehensive audit
um

00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:02.870 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's a significant amount of the
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity money that they have
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
for annual awards for purpose
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
of the organization
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
the higher you go in annual revenues the
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
smaller fifteen thousand dollars becomes
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
but it's a flat amount
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh so this uh effort
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
to to raise this is something that both
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
the financial auditing
 
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.110 align:start position:0%
the financial auditing
folks

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh which is the accounting organization
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
and the not-for-profit organization in
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
both were in favor of lifting this
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
last year we've proposed three million
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
dollars in further conversation with
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
attorney donovan uh
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
some level it should it it could be
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
raised and still be competitive with the
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
other 50 states uh in in their policies
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
um he just felt that if we tried to
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
raise it to three million dollars it was
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
beyond where we should be lifting it
 
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:10.949 align:start position:0%
beyond where we should be lifting it
so

00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully this amendment this year is
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh amenable to the legislature and uh
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
we can proceed to relieve that financial
 
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.790 align:start position:0%
we can proceed to relieve that financial
burden

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
burden
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
uh from
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh the required filings by
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit organizations at a
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative wolper do you have a
 
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.430 align:start position:0%
representative wolper do you have a
question

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
i do mr chairman thank you and thank you
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh you spoke
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
about uh the
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
120 i believe it was you said
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh organizations that were between one
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
and two million that would be exempted
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
from auditing by this bill
 
00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:52.389 align:start position:0%
from auditing by this bill
and

00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
i thought you said it cost them about 15
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year
 
00:14:56.639 --> 00:15:00.069 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year
15

00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
are you talking about 15 000 each or 15
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
million dollars altogether no it's 15
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
000 if i've said that incorrectly i'm
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
apologize 15 thousand dollars is
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's each
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
there ought to be per per
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um

section 3
of

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
this bill um
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
changing from 1 million to 2 million but
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
you said nothing about the
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
the other parts of the bill
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
do you have um anything to share with us
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.590 align:start position:0%
i don't
i

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
organizations that are below
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
whatever minimum is
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
what what is the standard practice for
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
their um finances and without an audit
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
or are they doing a more simple audit um
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
i think it varies because we're talking
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
about the you know such a broad range of
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
organizations fifty thousand dollars up
 
00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:27.910 align:start position:0%
organizations fifty thousand dollars up
to

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh a million
 
00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:31.269 align:start position:0%
uh a million
um

00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
they all
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
comply with the 990 forms
 
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.629 align:start position:0%
comply with the 990 forms
so

00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
if you're familiar with those
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's a statement of financial position
 
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.910 align:start position:0%
it's a statement of financial position
with

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
revenues and expenses
 
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.949 align:start position:0%
revenues and expenses
cash

00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
and and uh the primary expenses of the
 
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.910 align:start position:0%
and and uh the primary expenses of the
organization

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.350 align:start position:0%
organization
uh

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
including personnel
 
00:16:57.759 --> 00:16:59.509 align:start position:0%
including personnel
uh

00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i i
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
mean that's
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
and so what the the auditors just don't
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
feel like they are adding that much
 
00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:10.549 align:start position:0%
feel like they are adding that much
value

00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:11.990 align:start position:0%
value
uh

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
i'll leave that actually to mr donovan
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
to to explain but uh
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
they thought
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
that this is a requirement that could be
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
relaxed by to to organizations in this
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
1 million to 2 million
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative langley
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um good morning
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
senator can you help me understand
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
how this legislation will impact upon
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
the requirements of becoming a 501c3
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
or if it has any impact on that
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
on the application process no i don't
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
believe so
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
but but the requirements once you've
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
been 501 speed 3.
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
well yes it
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
as i understand you you're one will this
 
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.870 align:start position:0%
as i understand you you're one will this
affect

affect
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
501 c 3 not for profits correct yes
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
in terms of auditing
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
they would they'll
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
again i
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%

those will not be audited
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
for that small group that
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
sits between a million and two million

00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
they're they're all aicpa
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
uh recognized
 
00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:26.070 align:start position:0%
uh recognized
organizations

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
follow up so it would be the um
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
an outside auditing firm correct yes
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay probably from within the state all
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
right thank you yes
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative chase thank you mr chair
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question i
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
um would like you to repeat to me if you
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
would the organizations you were saying
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
that the non-profits between a certain
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
amount of money will not be audited
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
what was that what was that um amount
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
this is raising that auditing cap
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
or the floor
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
actually right uh
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
from one million to two million dollars
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
correct but you had just before senator
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
um deloranzo asked you said something
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
about this would not will affect the
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
501cs the 990s still have to be filled
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
out but will not be audited and you said
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
organizations between and you gave a
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
certain amount of money it was way under
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
the million
 
00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:23.919 align:start position:0%
so the little guys
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
you said 50 million anything that's
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
below the floor now okay
 
00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:29.350 align:start position:0%
below the floor now okay
uh

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.310 align:start position:0%
uh
isn't

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
oh you don't they do the form 990s on an
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
annual basis
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you yes and mr donovan
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
maintains those i've been on some
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit boards i know
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
the filing date and how they follow up
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
with the organizations if you fail to
 
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.710 align:start position:0%
with the organizations if you fail to
file

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
file
 
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.789 align:start position:0%
file
and

00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:51.669 align:start position:0%
and
it's

00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative andrus
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
to taking my question
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
my question is if this was changed to
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
two million dollars and there wouldn't
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
be an audit anything under it would it
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
be possible to make a change and do
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
random audits every year a small amount
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
and that just keeps everybody's on their
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
i asked that question of the auditors
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
and they said
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
they come in and do that
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
on an organization's request
 
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.549 align:start position:0%
on an organization's request
but

00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
it's more um
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of work
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
for them to not have had
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
relationship with the company
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
or with with the not-for-profit
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the way they reported
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
it they said
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
yeah it seemed logical to me as well
 
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.990 align:start position:0%
yeah it seemed logical to me as well
uh

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.110 align:start position:0%
uh
but

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
they said that
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
did the amount of startup uh to do that
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
there there'd be overcharging
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
for that initial
 
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.350 align:start position:0%
for that initial
uh

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
do you know of any charitable
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
organizations that have asked for the
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
change yes
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
they have approached me and and once
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
into it
 
00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:38.950 align:start position:0%
into it
we

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
we've had the benefit in testimony a
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
year ago uh
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
from people to that uh
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
it's just it's time it's it's time to
 
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
come back and take a look at what we did
 
00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.390 align:start position:0%
come back and take a look at what we did
2004

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
2004
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
in establishing the level
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
and considering
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
what an appropriate level today would be
 
00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:05.029 align:start position:0%
what an appropriate level today would be
and

00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
i i yield to
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
attorney donovan he uh
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
he's a good judge of what he does and if
 
00:23:12.159 --> 00:23:13.029 align:start position:0%
he's a good judge of what he does and if
he's

00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
he's
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
amenable to a two million dollar cap
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
that it will help a number of
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
organizations that i'm familiar with
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um senator i don't
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
know if it's you or mr donovan who would
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
be best to answer
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
um i
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
wonder if there's a need to clarify
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
when we use the word audit i think we're
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
talking about two different things
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
on the one hand we're talking about a
 
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.909 align:start position:0%
on the one hand we're talking about a
large

00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
agency not-for-profit agency charitable
 
00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:48.630 align:start position:0%
agency not-for-profit agency charitable
agency

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
being required as part of its own due
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
diligence to hire an outside auditor to
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
come in
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
and verify the accuracy of their books
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
that's entirely separate from the work
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
that charitable trusts would do
 
00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.990 align:start position:0%
that charitable trusts would do
in

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
making sure
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
representing the interests of the state
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
not the the agency
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
repre making sure that all
 
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.710 align:start position:0%
repre making sure that all
um

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.750 align:start position:0%
um
all

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
charitable operations in the state
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
are reviewed for example i'm the
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
treasurer of the durham historic
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
association and at forty four thousand
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
i have to fill out a form
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
and file it and in due course
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
charitable trust make sure that we're
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
doing what we should do that's entirely
 
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.909 align:start position:0%
doing what we should do that's entirely
separate

00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
from what we're talking about here so
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
that it's not
 
00:24:55.039 --> 00:24:56.149 align:start position:0%
that it's not
that

00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
those organizations up to 1 million or 2
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
million or whatever would not be
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
within the responsibility
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
of charitable trust it's just that
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have to hire
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
an expensive accounting firm
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
to do an external audit
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
am i correct in that
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
i wish i would have added that to my
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
testimony if i fail so
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent explanation thank you
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
committee my name is tom donovan i'm the
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
director of charitable trust at the
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office we have
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility for oversight of the 11
 
00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.789 align:start position:0%
responsibility for oversight of the 11
000

00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations that do
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
important work every day in our state
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
everything from our large hospitals and
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
private colleges down to local little
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
leagues and historical societies and
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
everything in between
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
as is common we do not take a position
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
on sb 375
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
i can report that there were
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
we had some concerns about the language
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
as introduced in the senate and there
 
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.870 align:start position:0%
as introduced in the senate and there
were

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh changes made and uh we feel
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the amendments that
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
were made and then um
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
senator khan's amendment added section 3
 
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.190 align:start position:0%
senator khan's amendment added section 3
about

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
changing the floor for audits so i'd be
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
members may have about this
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to be back this afternoon on
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
another bill sb 302
 
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.110 align:start position:0%
another bill sb 302
um

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
which also relates to charities and we
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
are opposing that bill i can't be there
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
my assistant director diane quinlan will
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
be there for that but that's a different
 
00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:05.029 align:start position:0%
be there for that but that's a different
bill

00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
questions for attorney donovan
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
i guess uh the question just with regard
 
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
to the increase from a million dollars
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
to two million dollars is is that
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
something that is appropriate in
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate change in this day and age
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
is it it reflects uh inflation to uh
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
sure and we look at what other states do
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
and it's it's sort of on the high side
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
for a floor but we feel comfortable
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
with it we're sensitive to the fact that
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
it's an expense
 
00:27:34.399 --> 00:27:36.070 align:start position:0%
it's an expense
because

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
the organizations do have to hire an
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
outside cpa firm and that does cost
 
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.669 align:start position:0%
outside cpa firm and that does cost
money

00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
some firms would charge that that's on i
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
think on the high side some would charge
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
less it's just like lawyers or other
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
providers they have different some are
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
more expensive than others but
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
it certainly is an expense
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
and we're sensitive to that
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
if i could just follow up on that
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
it seem it seems that it would be
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
typical for organizations to be audited
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
in some
 
00:28:10.799 --> 00:28:12.870 align:start position:0%
in some
way

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
is this
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
do you believe as a result of making
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
this change
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
organizations that will decide to no
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
longer be audited or would they
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
typically be audited that's a good
 
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.230 align:start position:0%
typically be audited that's a good
question

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
some organizations have
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
other requirements to be audited
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
independent of ours for instance i
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
believe some organizations that may have
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
a contract with dhhs
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
or a federal agency they may have a
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
requirement as a term of that grant or
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
contract to have an audit
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
uh so that that would not be affected by
 
00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:50.389 align:start position:0%
uh so that that would not be affected by
this

00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
but i do believe there will be some
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
organizations um
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
senator khan mentioned the constituent
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
of his who
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
has revenue between a million and two
 
00:29:00.399 --> 00:29:01.269 align:start position:0%
has revenue between a million and two
million

00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:02.230 align:start position:0%
million
and

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
i guess i i do have another question if
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
i could and that's with regard to the
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
first part of the bill and basically the
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that i've heard with regard to
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
there's no really no problem in new
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire as of right now
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
but this is sort of anticipated
 
00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:29.110 align:start position:0%
but this is sort of anticipated
anticipatory

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
anticipatory
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
and that we don't want any type of
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.149 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
so the question that i have is is it
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
necessary to pass legislation if
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
there's no immediate purpose for it
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
so that's a judgment call i can't
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
can't comment on that
 
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you

follow up on the chairs question in a
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
slightly different way
 
00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.870 align:start position:0%
slightly different way
um

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
have you in your professional
 
00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:12.870 align:start position:0%
have you in your professional
uh

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
area of authority
 
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.350 align:start position:0%
area of authority
recognized

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.230 align:start position:0%
recognized
any

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.149 align:start position:0%
any
problem

00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
that exists in the state of new
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.190 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.110 align:start position:0%
we
manage

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
manage
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.110 align:start position:0%
so
i

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.549 align:start position:0%
i
um

00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
i think that our old forms needed work
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
and we have changed them
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
um particularly for smaller
 
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.190 align:start position:0%
um particularly for smaller
organizations

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.830 align:start position:0%
organizations
um

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.110 align:start position:0%
um
i

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
one of the charges that was placed on me
 
00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
when i got hired seven years ago was to
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
have allow online filing to make it
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
easier and we've now implemented that
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
and i think that that helps i think it's
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
not so much what is being requested
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.830 align:start position:0%
but um
how

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:12.870 align:start position:0%
how
um

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
inconvenient it is to get people to to
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
do that and so we've been looking at
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
ways to streamline it
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
so we get the information we need to do
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
our job but to do it in a way that's not
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
unduly burdensome for the charities
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
thank you may i follow up
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
are you saying that under
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
the authority to make sure
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
that you can do
 
00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.950 align:start position:0%
that you can do
the

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
the most appropriate job possible to
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
monitor charitable trusts including
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
making changes in practices
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
yes but
 
00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:04.149 align:start position:0%
yes but
um

00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
the world of fundraising has changed um
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
in recent years um
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
because of online giving which is a good
 
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.509 align:start position:0%
because of online giving which is a good
thing

00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
there's good gofundme and all sorts of
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
other opportunities
 
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.350 align:start position:0%
other opportunities
and

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
are some of our statutes about
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
fundraising were written before there
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
was an internet
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
and so the laws we currently have were
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
designed for a pre-internet era so i
 
00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:33.750 align:start position:0%
designed for a pre-internet era so i
think

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.710 align:start position:0%
think
um

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
on my to-do list in the to-do list of
 
00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:38.799 align:start position:0%
people in my position around the country
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
think about ways to uh
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
address that and that likely would have
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
to happen by regulation and the big
 
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
thing would be
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
disclosures to the public
 
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
these platforms they don't realize that
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
maybe the money could be redirected to
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
another organization or it might take a
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
month or two months for the for the
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
charity to get the money
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
um we were recently
 
00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.230 align:start position:0%
um we were recently
um

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
um had looked into facebook because
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
there was a charity that took
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
didn't get their money for a year well
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
it turns out there had been an issue
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
with respect to bank account numbers and
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
things like that but
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
um we were concerned about that we think
 
00:33:23.919 --> 00:33:25.590 align:start position:0%
um we were concerned about that we think
legislation

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
could help with that could i follow up
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
just once more
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
you may thank you very much so um do you
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
anticipate then
 
00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.310 align:start position:0%
anticipate then
that

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
um the first uh part of this bill which
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
seems if i'm reading it correctly say
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
we can't whatever we're doing now is
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay but we can't make other changes
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
do you see that as conceivably
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
interfering with your ability
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
to carry out all the work that you
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.789 align:start position:0%
in the
incredibly

00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
incredibly
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
fine tradition of charitable trusts
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
let me answer it this way uh
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
representative if we were going to make
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
a change on the try it propose to make a
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
change with respect to online giving
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
we'd come to you and and propose a bill
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
and i guess i did if i could just that
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
because you you mentioned well there are
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
some things that we might need to do
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
you referred to gofundme
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
and the way monies are being used
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
particularly with regard online and you
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned regulation but
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
if i read this correctly
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
regular you would not be able to do
 
00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:46.470 align:start position:0%
regular you would not be able to do
regulation

00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of administrative rules you
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
would actually have to come to the
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
legislature and make statutory changes
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question mr donovan um
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know as we were speaking about
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
charities i
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
thought about charitable gaming
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
and wondering about you know
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
regulating and auditing charitable gang
 
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.589 align:start position:0%
regulating and auditing charitable gang
gaming

00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so um
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
luckily uh lottery takes care of the
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
oversight of charitable gaming not us
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
and they do have
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
um good oversight uh and i know there
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
situations where there's been abuse with
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
and we hear and we'll hear it we'll be
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
informed about that but they do
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
a form of audit with respect to that
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
so that's certainly an area of concern
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
but lottery's got a lot of eyes looking
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative chase thank you very much
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
mr donovan so just because i don't
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
understand all of this and i want to are
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
you saying that all the online gofundmes
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
and these other fundraisers do you
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
actually have
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
you have to look at these and make sure
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
that they're legitimate or how is this
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
affecting the charitable trust
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
okay so there are and i'll try not to
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
take too much time um
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
there's big c capital c charity and
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
small seek charity
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
um the bulk of giving on gofundme for
 
00:36:35.839 --> 00:36:37.030 align:start position:0%
um the bulk of giving on gofundme for
instance

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
instance
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
my name is john smith and my wife needs
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
help paying medical bills
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
that is small c charity
 
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.310 align:start position:0%
that is small c charity
uh

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh it's one person asking for help for
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
an individual that is not regulated by
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
big c charity also happens on gofundme
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
to a lesser extent and that is where
 
00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:05.349 align:start position:0%
to a lesser extent and that is where
um

00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
let's say the red cross um is
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh raising money
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
and want and is using gofundme as
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
as one means to do so
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
that would be regulated by us and a
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
number of small red cross isn't a good
 
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.390 align:start position:0%
number of small red cross isn't a good
example

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
maybe the
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
historical society would be more likely
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
to you to do a gofundme campaign
 
00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.150 align:start position:0%
to you to do a gofundme campaign
and

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
we would have some concern to protect
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
the charity and also the donor
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
that that um things are going correctly
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
and it's not just gofundme it's also
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
facebook um
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
amazon um
 
00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:44.550 align:start position:0%
amazon um
smile

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
smile
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
um go uh paypal
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of these online
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
platforms and we just have concerns that
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to discourage it
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
because it's a it's a way for people to
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
give money quickly simply and it's a way
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
for charities to raise money
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
and we sure would prefer that
 
00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:06.790 align:start position:0%
and we sure would prefer that
uh

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
um in comparison with those annoying
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
and we're actually seeing there's less
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
of that happening because so much of
 
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
giving is moved online
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
just one follow-up representative chase
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
that just
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
that was very clear thank you i
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
understand now one other thing though is
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
what about like the giving tuesday and
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
these other kickoffs the 603s that we
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
get now is this where did those fall so
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
those um
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh those are great opportunities and but
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
those charities
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
should all be registered with us
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
and what we find the new hampshire
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
center for nonprofits does
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
give new hampshire
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
events every so often and they have
 
00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.990 align:start position:0%
events every so often and they have
requirements

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
including that they be in good standing
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
with our office
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
and so you'd be amazed how many
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
charities that are not in good standing
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
with us clean get their
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
delayed reports in to us so they can be
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
in good standing so they can participate
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
so those sorts of things we really
 
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.990 align:start position:0%
so those sorts of things we really
encourage

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.510 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative

um
we

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
we get a couple of calls a week
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
from people asking
 
00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:56.870 align:start position:0%
from people asking
about

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%

we post all of the charities on our
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
website and we either indicate whether
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%

opportunity to speak to you today about
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
senate bill 375 my name is elizabeth
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
mcguigan and i'm director of policy for
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
the philanthropy roundtable
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
now the round table is a network of
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
charitable donors working to foster
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
excellence in philanthropy and to
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
protect philanthropic freedom
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
our more than 600 members include
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
individual givers family foundations and
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
community foundations located in new
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire and around the country
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire is home to nearly 700
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
foundations that give out millions to
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
charitable causes each year
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's future will be brighter
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
if it continues to foster a friendly
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
environment for private charitable
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
organizations to help meet the needs of
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
its citizens enrich enrich its culture
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
and help solve pressing social
 
00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.750 align:start position:0%
and help solve pressing social
challenges

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
so this bill the charity protection act
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
allows new hampshire's philanthropic
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
organizations to fulfill their missions
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
without government overreach
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
the bill calls for any new requirements
 
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.510 align:start position:0%
the bill calls for any new requirements
and

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
c 3 corporations to first be deliberated
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
and approved by the legislature
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
excluding charitable trusts
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
under new hampshire statute this
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
protects private foundations and
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations and ensures
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
that the state's attorney general still
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
maintains full authority for regulations
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
over charitable trusts charitable sales
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
promotions and solicitations
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
this is a common sense reform that
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
honors the transparency of the
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
legislative process as well as your
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
roles as duly elected representatives
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
so this bill allows new hampshire's
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
charities to focus on advancing their
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
missions rather than on complying with
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
increased government mandates
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
by requiring that the state legislature
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
approve any new regulations or reporting
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
requirements on charitable organizations
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
this measure introduces transparency and
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
accountability into the regulatory
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
process now this is a proactive
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
protective bill that we feel sends a
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
signal to charities that new hampshire
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
will not overreach in the future and
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
that it values the strength of its
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
charitable sector
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
so why pass this bill if there's not
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
currently a problem with regulatory
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
overreach in new hampshire
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
the short answer is if overreach becomes
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
a problem in new hampshire as we've seen
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
in other states under future officials
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
it will be too late to address through
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
simple proactive legislation
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
nationwide charitable organizations are
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
increasingly facing calls to disclose
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
more details about operations governance
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
and grant making that do not improve
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
organizational effectiveness but do
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
increase operational and compliance
 
00:43:42.079 --> 00:43:43.109 align:start position:0%
increase operational and compliance
costs

00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
some states require nonprofit
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
corporations to file to complete forms
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
with multiple agencies that often act as
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
repetitive and sometimes invasive
 
00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:53.270 align:start position:0%
repetitive and sometimes invasive
information

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
while there are no social benefits to
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
these new regulations they divert
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
funding away from charitable giving and
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
toward complying with red tape
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
so this bill aligns new hampshire's
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
governance of charitable corporations
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
with existing state and federal law
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
unless the legislature determines that
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's necessary to enact changes
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
this reduces the potential for unelected
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
officials to impose more stringent
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
operating requirements thereby
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
increasing the operational
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
and compliance costs on tax-exempt
 
00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.190 align:start position:0%
and compliance costs on tax-exempt
organizations

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
so we believe philanthropy can and
 
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
should be a vital part of our
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
communities we've all seen the good work
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
that charitable organizations have done
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and this bill will
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
help to protect new hampshire's
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
charitable sector and send a proactive
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
message to charities that new hampshire
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
is a pro-philanthropy state that values
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
their contributions to local communities
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%

00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%

00:44:49.359 --> 00:44:50.550 align:start position:0%
time today i'm happy to answer any
questions

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:50.560 align:start position:0%

questions
bless

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
any questions for
 
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.430 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
have to be honest i've never heard of
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
the philanthropy roundtable before so
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
could and just in terms of
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
making it new hampshire or are you to do
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
could you give us an example of who
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
might your membership be in new
 
00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.510 align:start position:0%
might your membership be in new
hampshire

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not on the membership side so i
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
don't have specific names of our members
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
in the state but in general we're
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
private foundations community
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
foundations and individual givers who
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
care about advancing
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
causes that matter to the communities
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%

looking at um your statement and um i
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan did you have a
 
00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.390 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan did you have a
question

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
i apologize i missed the beginning of
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
your presentation um
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
and actually
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
the question was just asked was the
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
first one that i had but the second 501
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
c3s are often um
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
expanding their mission beyond i think
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
what was originally envisioned um many
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
groups do
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
what stays you know just on the farce
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
which isn't quite political accuracy but
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
very close to it and also like here in
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire something as pervasive as
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
we use them to administer
 
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
all kinds of government programs
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
including for example
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
a very large new educational voucher
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
program so how
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
will this um bill impact uh
 
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
the state's ability to uh
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
um keep track of
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
501 c3s who are administering
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
governmental programs for them and also
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
to make sure that uh they don't cross
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
the line with political advocacy or
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
other uh activities
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
sure i would uh thank you for your
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
question i would
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
say that there uh
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
there are a couple different aspects of
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
the bill that i would point out the
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
first is that this law would not apply
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
to state grants or to state contracts
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
as well as fraud investigations or
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
general enforcement measures so if there
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
are state if there are charities that
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
are working with the state there is a
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
need for transparency if they're getting
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
state contracts that of course is not
 
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.750 align:start position:0%
state contracts that of course is not
covered

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
covered
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
by this bill
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
to your second point about political
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
advocacy for example um you know i think
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
that is a separate question that if 501
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
c 3s in general are overstepping their
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
stated missions that is either
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
something that should be investigated
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
and enforced which is allowed under this
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
legislation or it could be an avenue for
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
further legislation to you know on the
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
state or even on the federal level to
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
say what is a 501c3 and what should they
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
be allowed to do
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
all right thanks thanks
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.270 align:start position:0%

force an employee to court
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
after finding of probable cause of
 
01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination has been made by the
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
human rights commission
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
this makes the employee have to start
 
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
the process over again from scratch
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
i feel and many other people feel the
 
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
employee should be the only person to
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
decide where to pursue their claim
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
this bill would not impact many claims
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
but for those it does
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
the impact would be invaluable and i
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
would appreciate this committee's
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair members of the

name is dave giuve i am a senior vice
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
president at the business and industry
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
association which serves as new
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire statewide chamber of commerce
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
for those i know many of you are
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with the bia for those of you
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
who are not we have approximately 400
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
employer members with over 90 000 new
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire employees we are here in
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill today and i
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
thought it was interesting that senator
 
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
french described this as a bill
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
grounded in fairness because i would
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
argue this bill is completely unfair
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
and inappropriate for new hampshire in
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.310 align:start position:0%
that we
are

01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
choosing through this legislation to
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
only allow one side or one party access
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
to the courts in a jury
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
trial that seems eminently unfair to me
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
at best kill this bill but i would also
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
recommend perhaps you might want to
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
consider interim study because i do
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
think there are issues
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
related to how
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination cases
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
get adjudicated in the state that are
 
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
worth looking into to see if we can
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
improve the process and make it fairer
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
and faster for all parties so mr chair i
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if i'm under a minute but
 
01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony i would say
 
01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
that there are several employment
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are here who've also
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
filled out pink cards who have a lot of
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
experience in this area i'm happy to
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
answer questions but they may be more uh
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
capable of answering than i
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions for mr
 
01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:51.110 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions for mr
juve

01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
i think you pretty much stayed within
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
your mouth thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:00.790 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh good morning
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
to the house judiciary committee
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
my name is ani malachi i'm the executive
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
director for the human rights commission
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
i don't need a lot of time to speak but
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to just make sure everyone knew
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
that i was here so that i could answer
 
01:34:37.110 --> 01:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might have this
 
01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:38.470 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might have this
morning

01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
maybe it's better to have others provide
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
testimony and then you call me back up
 
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
but it is
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
up to the beautiful smart minds that are
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
in this room to determine what order
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
you'd like to do this
 
01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
i do have a handout and i'll make sure
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
that goes over to
 
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative merner and he can pass
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
well are you
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
i guess if i could just ask are you
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
supportive of the legislation do you
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
what would be the consequence of passing
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
the legislation if you could since
 
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to affect
 
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
your organization right um so uh the the
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
commission is supportive of whatever the
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
legislature decides to do our job is to
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
follow the laws as so written and so
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
decided um and so we we don't take a
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
position on this
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
we will we will do what we're told to do
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
we already do have hearings there
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh potentially this could be more
 
01:35:36.639 --> 01:35:37.430 align:start position:0%
uh potentially this could be more
but

01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
at this point it is indeterminable
 
01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:40.629 align:start position:0%
at this point it is indeterminable
because

01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
not sure if respondents if not allowed
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
to remove if they're going to
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
settle cases more so than having
 
01:35:53.109 --> 01:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
hearings or removing them to court or if
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
they will stay with us and finish out
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
the hearing process there's no way to
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
know that at this point
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
so it would it would just it would
 
01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
really depend on on what they would do
 
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
and if they remain with us then yes we
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
would need to have some some staffing
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
changes made
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
but those are some some of those
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
elements are things that we need anyway
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh just in order just to allow us to
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
continue to move through the caseload
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm just reading the
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
summary of um
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
the hearing in
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.870 align:start position:0%
in the senate
and

01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
talks about you your uh testimony but it
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
also says under the current law
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
one's employer can force an employee to
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
court after finding probable cause and
 
01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
discrimination has been made by the hrc
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
what what exactly does that mean that
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
they can force somebody to go i that's a
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
very good question and thank you for
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
that i'm not sure about forcing i know
 
01:37:00.629 --> 01:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
that respondents have an opportunity to
 
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
remove a case after probable cause so i
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
think it depends on who's writing as to
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's a force
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
representative mclean
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question so what what kind
 
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
what drives people to go to the human
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
rights commission over going to
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh the superior court in the first place
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
um what's the difference that you see
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question um the
 
01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
statute so statutorily you are required
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
to come to the human rights commission
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
if you have a charge of discrimination
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
in the areas of employment public
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
accommodation and housing
 
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
or with with public education which was
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
added k-12 public education that was
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
added in 2019 so education has what's
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
called a true choice of forum you can
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
come to the hrc or you can choose to
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
take it to court there are opportunities
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
after certain steps that if the with
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
either party would like to remove and go
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
to court they have the opportunity to do
 
01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:12.790 align:start position:0%
to court they have the opportunity to do
that

01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
customarily if the complainant is
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
removing or the charging party is
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
removing they are represented by council
 
01:38:21.109 --> 01:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
with our process
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have counsel
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of what side of the table
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
you're sitting on whether you're the
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
complainant or the respondent
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
so that if if the law weren't there
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a driving force but
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
statutorily people have to come to the
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
commission first to docket their charge
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh they can certainly if it's if they're
 
01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
a complainant they can remove it after
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
docketing and go on to court and they
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
don't have to continue through with our
 
01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.590 align:start position:0%
don't have to continue through with our
process

01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
yep follow up
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
so and
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned earlier in response to
 
01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
representative chase's question i think
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
that you didn't have the data but i just
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure do you have any
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
visibility in the amount of people at
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
the end of the 180 days who are
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
removing their case to the court of
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
their own volition or
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
the respondents are moving so do you
 
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
have any feel for what the breakdown is
 
01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the follow-up so
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
um the way this works is statutorily the
 
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
commission has two years to move through
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh the totality of a case
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
and the way it's written yes 180 days
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
you can remove
 
01:39:31.679 --> 01:39:32.870 align:start position:0%
you can remove
but

01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
usually what will happen is a respondent
 
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
will typically remove after probable
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
cause is found because that's when they
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
are able to remove
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
however long that takes
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
to to get to the probable cause finding
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
so they're able to remove at that point
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
the complainant can remove at any point
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
so to begin the process they the a
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
complaint comes in in the door
 
01:39:59.590 --> 01:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
and it meets the legal standard of a
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
charge uh parties are notified and then
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
after that the respondent will respond
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
to that charge
 
01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:06.629 align:start position:0%
to that charge
um

01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
once the um
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
once the case is assigned to an
 
01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:14.229 align:start position:0%
once the case is assigned to an
investigator

01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
investigator
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
then the investigation takes place and
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
there's a finding at the end of that
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's probable cause or no
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
probable cause if there's a no probable
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
cause finding everything is dismissed
 
01:40:26.709 --> 01:40:26.719 align:start position:0%
the case is closed however there are
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
appeal rights that
 
01:40:28.719 --> 01:40:29.750 align:start position:0%
appeal rights that
the

01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
charging party has or the complaint has
 
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
if they don't agree with our finding
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of different options
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
that they have at that point if it's
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
probable cause then what happens in our
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
process is it moves on to a conciliation
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
which for the non-lawyers is really it's
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
mediation just after probable cause
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
finding so there's another opportunity
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
for both parties to come together and to
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the uh the charges and to
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
determine if they can make a settlement
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
if a settlement is not reached at the
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
conciliation conference then it turns
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
into a pre-hearing conference which
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
means we start to look at dates on the
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
calendar to be able to schedule the
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
hearing a hearing is scheduled but
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
between the
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
pre-hearing meeting and the actual
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
commencement of a hearing the parties
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
can still negotiate they can still talk
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
and potentially reach a settlement and
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
if they do great then the parties will
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
notify the commission a settlement has
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
been reached and then as far as we're
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you miss
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
malachi for taking my questions you know
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
i'm listening and looking at the
 
01:41:49.590 --> 01:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
timeline on of how long it takes to
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
get to a conclusion on a case or to end
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
the case and it sounds like some of the
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
timelines are up to two years
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
okay may follow up you may so
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
when you have a worker for example who
 
01:42:02.719 --> 01:42:03.590 align:start position:0%
when you have a worker for example who
is

01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
in a workplace and they're being
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
discriminated against for whatever
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
reason it seems to me or do you think
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's a um
 
01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:13.350 align:start position:0%
that's a um
a

01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the questions uh
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
representative dilorenzo
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
it depends on on what the charge is
 
01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:26.870 align:start position:0%
it depends on on what the charge is
ultimately

01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
what happens is we have five
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
investigators to investigate
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
cases for the entire state
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
there were a few more prior to 2011 and
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
in this upcoming budget cycle like all
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
state agencies i'm asking for additional
 
01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:41.990 align:start position:0%
state agencies i'm asking for additional
help

01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
and so in order to not
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
to overburden the investigators you want
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
to have them have a realistic caseload
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
so that it's something they can actually
 
01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
touch the cases and move through them a
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
bit more expeditiously we recently went
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
through our process
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
staff and management and looked at areas
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
where we could tighten timelines up
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
report writing is one of those things so
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
that we can move through the cases
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say quickly because that
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
seems like you're cutting corners no
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
but timelines are tightened up right so
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
where someone may have had months to
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
send something in it's several weeks
 
01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.750 align:start position:0%
send something in it's several weeks
and

01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
since the
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
finishing of that conversation with
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
staff and coming up with a new system or
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
an updated system i should say
 
01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
recently the assistant director and i uh
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
sat in on a conversation with the with
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
the bar uh the employment bar
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
and employment section of the bar excuse
 
01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:45.510 align:start position:0%
and employment section of the bar excuse
me

01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
and informed them of what that is going
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
to look like and you know that we're all
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
here wanting the same things that the
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
case is moved through quicker
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
but certainly not at uh not to the
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
detriment of either party because our
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
job at the commission is to be neutral
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
we're fact finders and to neutrally
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
in a neutral format listen to what's
 
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
happened and make a neutral
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
determination so
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're not favoring one party over the
 
01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:11.750 align:start position:0%
we're not favoring one party over the
other

01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
certainly if a person has lost a job
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
certainly that's important and traumatic
 
01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:18.470 align:start position:0%
certainly that's important and traumatic
however

01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
even in uh
 
01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:21.430 align:start position:0%
even in uh
other

01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:22.470 align:start position:0%
other
areas

01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's not something because of the
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
investigation that needs to take place
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be thorough you need to
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
investigate you need to interview
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
witnesses you need to talk to the
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
individual or anyone that witnessed it
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
you have to look through and request
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
files to come from the respondent
 
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
and you also need to
 
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
be able to schedule everything based on
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
people's actual schedules
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
and we're able to do some things in a
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
virtual manner which is helpful for
 
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
complainants who may have lost income
 
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
and may not be able to could live in a
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
different place in the state
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
and may not be able to travel to our
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
office so we're looking at different
 
01:45:01.199 --> 01:45:02.550 align:start position:0%
office so we're looking at different
opportunities

01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
and ways to connect with people so that
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
they have every opportunity available to
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
let their voice be heard
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
would it be great if things like this
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
could be done in two weeks sure but
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's not a realistic timeline because
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
of the the steps that have to be taken
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
even in a condensed timeline that have
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
to be taken so that it's fair to both
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
sides the respondent needs to be able to
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
answer any charge given as thoroughly as
 
01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
the complainant has made their
 
01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:32.950 align:start position:0%
the complainant has made their
allegations

01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
allegations
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
just in terms of my understanding how
 
01:45:40.719 --> 01:45:41.750 align:start position:0%
just in terms of my understanding how
many

01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
how many petitions or complaints do you
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
receive in a typical year
 
01:45:47.199 --> 01:45:48.070 align:start position:0%
receive in a typical year
so

01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
um let's see uh looking at
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
and this is on the federal schedule just
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the employment ones we have a
 
01:45:58.470 --> 01:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
a work share agreement with the eeoc
 
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
who's our federal partner
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
so if we look at the federal fiscal year
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
for 2021
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
i believe we had a total of 242
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
closed cases and that's federal and
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
state only um but
 
01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:17.910 align:start position:0%
state only um but
we

01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
and then that of course you're looking
 
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
at not just ones that were filed so i
 
01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:22.149 align:start position:0%
at not just ones that were filed so i
think

01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
for 2021 we had a total of 192 cases
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
file that year but then we're pulling
 
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
from the previous year to move those
 
01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:31.030 align:start position:0%
from the previous year to move those
forward

01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:31.830 align:start position:0%
forward
so

01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
we could have anywhere from you know a
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
slow a slow month i use air quotes there
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
could be seven or eight charges that
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
come in that are docketed but we could
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
also have as many as 25 or so charges
 
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
that come in that are docketed there's
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
not really a rhyme or reason it's not
 
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.990 align:start position:0%
not really a rhyme or reason it's not
necessarily

01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
it's not always slower in the summer and
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative maclean
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thanks for taking
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question i mean i think it's
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
very important that we want to preserve
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
access to justice you know for everybody
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's involved in a claim
 
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
do you find
 
01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:14.390 align:start position:0%
do you find
that

01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:15.590 align:start position:0%
that
when

01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
people are having their claim removed to
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
the superior court by the respondents do
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
you do you have any data of a high
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
incidence because of the greater
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
financial burden so going to the
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
superior court that you're seeing
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
in that event a lot of people just
 
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
dropping their cases do you have any
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
data of how many people when that
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
happens actually go through the whole
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
course of things
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
or versus okay i'm in superior court now
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
i just don't have the resources to go
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
forward do you have any data around that
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
um that's a really really good question
 
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate that
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
because the individual has removed their
 
01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
well because the case has been removed
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
from the commission we are we do not
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
track it past there so what i could tell
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
you is you know how many have been
 
01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:06.639 align:start position:0%
removed by the respondent if any how
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
many have been removed by the
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
complainant i can tell you how many
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
cases settled i can tell you potentially
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
how many in a in a calendar year have
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
just withdrawn meaning they went
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere else or they were finished
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
so our job is complete at that point
 
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
so i do not have any additional data
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
or anecdotal data no one is required to
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
let us know what the outcome was
 
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
so i don't have anything past the
 
01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the commission
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative langley
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is a follow-up
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
to ms representative d lorenzo's
 
01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:50.790 align:start position:0%
to ms representative d lorenzo's
question

01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
do you have any capacity to triage
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
complaints as they come in or you know
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
decide at some level that something is
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
so egregious that it bumps to the top of
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
the list and gets immediate attention or
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
do they all sort of
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
have equal attention on their way in the
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
front door
 
01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
great question thank you for that um so
 
01:49:14.229 --> 01:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
customarily what will happen is things
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
have equal attention
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
however if we realize that there's
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
something that wow right if a charge
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
we have an amazing relationship with our
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
client services
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
representatives at the department of
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
justice and so we could have that
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
conversation uh with them to determine
 
01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
if if we could move if it makes sense to
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
move this one ahead so the difficulty
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
with that it's it's on both sides right
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
so the person if it's an egregious
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
situation you know
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
your heart and and your your sense of
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
justice wants to move that to the to the
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
top of the heap and move that through
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
the process however the other side of
 
01:49:54.149 --> 01:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
that is the other people who are waiting
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
in line who may who feel as though their
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
claim is just as important and deserves
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
just as much weight and care and
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
adjudication and investigation so that's
 
01:50:08.149 --> 01:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
a hard one
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
however if there's something that's just
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
so far out there uh we'll have that
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
conversation with the department of
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
justice to determine okay if we do this
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
you know we also have to look at
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
precedent what precedent are we setting
 
01:50:24.709 --> 01:50:24.719 align:start position:0%
um and what does that look like so
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's a non-answer to your question but
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the best i can do for you
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
this morning thank you thank you
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and miss
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
a question about
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
the effect of the
 
01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:45.830 align:start position:0%
the effect of the
pandemic

01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
and if you noticed more complaints
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic thank you thank you
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
for that question um we did not so
 
01:50:56.070 --> 01:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
complaints slowed down some during the
 
01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:57.189 align:start position:0%
complaints slowed down some during the
pandemic

01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:50:59.750 --> 01:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
um we still had them uh but they they
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
slowed down some
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
i i don't have actual numbers in front
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
of me but i could certainly look for
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
that and and send it to you okay thank
 
01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.669 align:start position:0%
that and and send it to you okay thank
you

01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
other questions representative simpson
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'd like to follow up on
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative maclean's question
 
01:51:17.199 --> 01:51:18.790 align:start position:0%
representative maclean's question
um

01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
you were saying that you do have the
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
data for how many cases are removed by
 
01:51:25.589 --> 01:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
respondents and how many are removed by
 
01:51:25.599 --> 01:51:26.870 align:start position:0%
respondents and how many are removed by
complainants

01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
complainants
 
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
and um i'd love to have that information
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
if you could give that to us um yes
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i do have a
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
handout here so i'll give that to you
 
01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
and it's just looking at 2021
 
01:51:39.990 --> 01:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
because 2020 is you know the year that
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
never happened um and so i think 2021 is
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
a you know post pen sort of post
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic but what those numbers look
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
like and so what i've done um actually
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
is taken our chart uh on how we schedule
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
the hearing and and so the status of of
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
that particular case was whether it was
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
settled if who it was removed by
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
and then below
 
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
or in the case name information it will
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
say if the respondent excuse me not the
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
respondent but specifically if the
 
01:52:14.070 --> 01:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
complainant is represented or
 
01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:15.430 align:start position:0%
complainant is represented or
unrepresented

01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
unrepresented
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
so if you see pro se cp then it just
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
means that they're not represented and
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
of course i would do that if there were
 
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
any respondents in any of these that
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
were unrepresented in this particular
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
situa for 2021 there were not but we do
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
have times where there are respondents
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
that are not represented by council and
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
move through our entire process up to
 
01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
and including a hearing
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
great thank you you're welcome
 
01:52:40.149 --> 01:52:40.159 align:start position:0%

answer
 
01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:08.070 align:start position:0%
answer
[Laughter]

01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:08.870 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
if

01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:10.149 align:start position:0%
if
okay

01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:53:15.189 --> 01:53:15.199 align:start position:0%
you uh and i think you just answered my
 
01:53:17.669 --> 01:53:17.679 align:start position:0%
my question and the the number of
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
complainants who are pro se and from
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
what i gathered there aren't very many
 
01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:23.830 align:start position:0%
what i gathered there aren't very many
who

01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:53:28.229 --> 01:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
are self-represented is that true um so
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh for 2021
 
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
we had 26 hearing schedule and this is
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
on the document that i will give you
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
also if you don't want to write it you
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
don't have to but um so we had 26
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
hearings scheduled
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
and we usually try to schedule three per
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
month because excuse me because some
 
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
will settle one may go ahead someone is
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
removed so we just try to at least
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
schedule three per month
 
01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
of the complainants that were
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
represented by council there were 18
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
which means that there were eight that
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
were unrepresented
 
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
and the total number of well all of the
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
respondents were represented the total
 
01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
number of cases of the 26 that settled
 
01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
were 11.
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
there were nine that were removed by
 
01:54:15.189 --> 01:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
respondent and one case was withdrawn
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
and then we actually ended up with one
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
case that we heard at the commission
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
which was a two-day case
 
01:54:26.070 --> 01:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
so the largest majority were removed by
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
the respondent
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
yes there were no there were no cases
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
removed by complainant
 
01:54:36.149 --> 01:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
so of the 26 9 were removed by
 
01:54:36.159 --> 01:54:39.669 align:start position:0%
so of the 26 9 were removed by
respondent

01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:39.679 --> 01:54:40.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:43.109 align:start position:0%
and
if

01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
it's common in the circuit court with
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
small claims in particular if people are
 
01:54:48.719 --> 01:54:51.510 align:start position:0%
small claims in particular if people are
self-represented

01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
self-represented
 
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
and the case is worth more than fifteen
 
01:54:55.589 --> 01:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars that respondents
 
01:54:57.589 --> 01:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
frequently ask
 
01:54:59.430 --> 01:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
to remove it to the superior court
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
more intimidating to people who are
 
01:55:03.119 --> 01:55:04.470 align:start position:0%
more intimidating to people who are
self-represented

01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
self-represented
 
01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
is that something that
 
01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:08.790 align:start position:0%
is that something that
you

01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
would know of or experience in terms of
 
01:55:13.589 --> 01:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
those types of claims that you're
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much uh chair gordon
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
for the question um i would not
 
01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
if it's removed to court the opportunity
 
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
for the complainant
 
01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
to have additional
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
fines and fees is more than with the
 
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
with the commission i'm not sure if that
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
answers your question
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
um i don't have any anecdotal data on
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
on that i mean we can suppose
 
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
that that may or may not be the case but
 
01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
i i don't have anything definitive
 
01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
um to to enlighten anyone on that topic
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
and i guess if i could ask one more
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
so basically whether they remove or not
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
basically what you said is that's really
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
for us to decide as a matter of policy
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
as to what we should do but
 
01:56:05.669 --> 01:56:05.679 align:start position:0%
i guess the question
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately that i'd have is what is the
 
01:56:10.709 --> 01:56:10.719 align:start position:0%
effect on the commission because
 
01:56:10.719 --> 01:56:11.990 align:start position:0%
effect on the commission because
i

01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
am already aware that just as other
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
people have
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
implied at least
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
that it seems to take a long time to go
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
human rights commission typically at
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
least anecdotally that's what i hear
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
that it's a long process and longer and
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
many people feel maybe longer than it
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:32.950 align:start position:0%
should be
so

01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:34.390 align:start position:0%
so
if

01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
what is the what will be the effect if
 
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
we were to make this change
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
what would be the effect on the human
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
rights commission would
 
01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:45.510 align:start position:0%
rights commission would
it

01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of time to hear
 
01:56:47.199 --> 01:56:48.390 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of time to hear
cases

01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:49.430 align:start position:0%
cases
would

01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:56:51.669 --> 01:56:51.679 align:start position:0%
you need additional resources to do
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
cases if you could
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
just address the effect on your
 
01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:56.470 align:start position:0%
just address the effect on your
commission

01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
 
01:56:58.960 --> 01:56:59.990 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
so

01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:03.189 --> 01:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
what would happen initially is that we
 
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
would be scheduling more cases so right
 
01:57:09.669 --> 01:57:09.679 align:start position:0%
now we're in february of 2022 we are
 
01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679 align:start position:0%
already scheduling hearings into the
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
month of december so um with
 
01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
conciliations those are happening those
 
01:57:17.910 --> 01:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
are at this point they're scheduled to a
 
01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:19.109 align:start position:0%
are at this point they're scheduled to a
week

01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's time for if
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
there's an attorney
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
attorneys on both sides they have
 
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
hearing schedules they have depositions
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
and a wide variety of things that
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
they're doing so when we schedule the
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
conciliations at the end of a pc finding
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
we are taking into considerations into
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
consideration everyone's schedule when
 
01:57:42.070 --> 01:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
we schedule the conciliations
 
01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:44.719 align:start position:0%
so with that being said if everyone
 
01:57:44.719 --> 01:57:46.149 align:start position:0%
so with that being said if everyone
remains

01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
remains
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to have
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
three per week maybe there's a little
 
01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:51.270 align:start position:0%
three per week maybe there's a little
more

01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
i'd have to really i'd have to sit and
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
look at that to see if it makes sense to
 
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
but if we're already scheduling into
 
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
november at this point or scheduling
 
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
into december at this point
 
01:58:04.470 --> 01:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
even if
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
there are more conciliations we're
 
01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
moving them further out
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh certainly if something settles prior
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
to the hearing of that particular month
 
01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
people are given an opportunity to move
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
up if they are prepared and ready we do
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
offer that as an option uh but what will
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
happen also is cases will settle
 
01:58:24.719 --> 01:58:25.510 align:start position:0%
happen also is cases will settle
so

01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:26.709 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:58:26.709 --> 01:58:26.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
that we we ask people to continue the
 
01:58:33.030 --> 01:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
conversation uh from the beginning we
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
offer a free mediation program so people
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
have access to that it doesn't they
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
don't lose their place in line if the
 
01:58:41.910 --> 01:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
mediation isn't productive and they can
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know they stay in um whether there's
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
and if it's a situation where it's
 
01:58:50.070 --> 01:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
something that's a really pressing case
 
01:58:52.470 --> 01:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
and the complainant doesn't want to
 
01:58:55.109 --> 01:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily speak to anyone representing
 
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
the respondent but they are interested
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
in some form of settlement then our
 
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
investigators can do a go
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
and negotiated settlement there for on
 
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
behalf of the person it's really just
 
01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
exchanging the information that this
 
01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
person is available and interested in
 
01:59:12.629 --> 01:59:12.639 align:start position:0%
settlement are you interested yes what
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
are your numbers great and move it
 
01:59:17.910 --> 01:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
forward um so we would have to have more
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
we would have to at least schedule four
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
or five hearings per month with the
 
01:59:25.910 --> 01:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
potential that maybe we'd have two per
 
01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
month um given the opportunity that
 
01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
people may get may settle
 
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
and with that being said um our hearing
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
panel is made up of three of our seven
 
01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
commissioners and these are
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
commissioners that were not involved
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
with the decision with the fact finding
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the of the case and so they will
 
01:59:46.950 --> 01:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
listen to a hearing which could be
 
01:59:49.350 --> 01:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
anywhere from one to three four days it
 
01:59:52.390 --> 01:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
depends on the complexity of the case
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
and so these volunteer commissioners
 
01:59:55.830 --> 01:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
would need to sit and listen to this and
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
then deliberate and then make a
 
02:00:00.870 --> 02:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
determination so
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
maybe um
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
and you know uh having additional staff
 
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
of course that's helpful so that you're
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
investigating more of the cases as
 
02:00:12.310 --> 02:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
they're coming into the door and getting
 
02:00:14.550 --> 02:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
us to a point where once it comes in and
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's docketed then hopefully being able
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
to assign it immediately
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
to an investigator to
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
allow that process to begin and
 
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
certainly offering mediation along the
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
way if that's helpful
 
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
and then we would need to have uh the
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
clerk to clerk the hearing so
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
a long answer to a short question
 
02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative simpson
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
sorry i have one more thank you
 
02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:50.310 align:start position:0%
sorry i have one more thank you
um

02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is referring back to the questions
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
that um chairman gordon was asking and i
 
02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
if this is in your
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
i apologize if this is in your handout
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
but do you know how many like
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
if the 8 pro se cases overlap at all
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
nine cases that respondents
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
removed to the superior court
 
02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
if there's any way of knowing that
 
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure that i understand the
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
question so i was i was listening to
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
your numbers and you said there were
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
eight pro se courses or pro se cases
 
02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
where the complainant represented
 
02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:28.790 align:start position:0%
where the complainant represented
themselves

02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
and then there were
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
nine cases where the respondents removed
 
02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
the case to superior court and i was
 
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
just wondering
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
if you
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
know or
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
can find out whether those cases overlap
 
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
great question and
 
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
if i'm looking at this correctly
 
02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
it looks like of the nine there may have
 
02:02:17.669 --> 02:02:17.679 align:start position:0%
been two
 
02:02:17.679 --> 02:02:19.030 align:start position:0%
been two
that

02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
complainant was unrepresented
 
02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
of the remain of the remaining ones then
 
02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
it would be that they were represented
 
02:02:30.629 --> 02:02:30.639 align:start position:0%
by council
 
02:02:33.189 --> 02:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:37.350 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative

langley
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and thank you for
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
again taking my question i hope i can
 
02:02:43.030 --> 02:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
articulate this clearly
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
for persons that might not be
 
02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:47.030 align:start position:0%
for persons that might not be
represented

02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
represented
 
02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
have you ever found that a case was so
 
02:02:50.870 --> 02:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
egregious that you felt that they were
 
02:02:54.070 --> 02:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
just poorly prepared and inadequate to
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
represent themselves
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
and defend themselves so that they would
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
have the need for an attorney and if so
 
02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
is there some do you have some resource
 
02:03:05.589 --> 02:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
that you could fall back on
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
to access those services for that
 
02:03:07.679 --> 02:03:09.109 align:start position:0%
to access those services for that
individual

02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:03:10.870 --> 02:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a really good question
 
02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:11.830 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a really good question
um

02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:13.270 align:start position:0%
um
customarily

02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
customarily
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
when there's the intake process and as
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
cases move forward
 
02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
to investigation
 
02:03:23.910 --> 02:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
we do our best at the commission to
 
02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
give the pro se complainant as much
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
information as possible but we go up to
 
02:03:32.229 --> 02:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
a point because we cannot advise them
 
02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
and the staff is
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
excruciatingly clear that we are not a
 
02:03:42.070 --> 02:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
legal service in terms of providing
 
02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
information on decisions that the
 
02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
complainant should make
 
02:03:48.629 --> 02:03:48.639 align:start position:0%
what we will do is
 
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
make suggestions and we do have a list
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
of if it's legal services a few of the
 
02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:58.149 align:start position:0%
of if it's legal services a few of the
complainant

02:03:58.149 --> 02:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
complainant
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
attorneys that practice before us we may
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
give them information but we make sure
 
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
that it's excruciatingly clear
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
a we can't give you legal advice period
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
full stop and that's for both parties we
 
02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
do not provide legal advice we can
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely explain to you ad nauseam
 
02:04:18.069 --> 02:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
what the law says or what your
 
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility is in terms of where we
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
are in the adjudication of the case
 
02:04:24.790 --> 02:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
of that particular charge we can give
 
02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
you as much information as you can stand
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
to to take in but we cannot advise you
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
and if the person if it appears that the
 
02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
person really needs legal advice
 
02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:35.910 align:start position:0%
person really needs legal advice
then

02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
the investigator if it's at that point
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
we'll make that
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
suggestion you know it sounds like you
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
might need some
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
really specialized legal advice that i
 
02:04:47.830 --> 02:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
can't give you here's some names here's
 
02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
some information of places you can look
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
this is not an exhaustive list but
 
02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
here's some here's some opportunities
 
02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
for you here
 
02:04:57.910 --> 02:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
if the if the individual if the
 
02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
complainant is still persisting with
 
02:05:02.149 --> 02:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
that then it may escalate and the
 
02:05:04.550 --> 02:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
assistant director may take over or if i
 
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
need to i will but usually
 
02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
usually talking with the investigator
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
they can because they they have they
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
start a rapport with the individual so
 
02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:14.719 align:start position:0%
usually them saying oh i can't i can't
 
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
advise you you really should seek legal
 
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
counsel on this um is where it stops but
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
if it needs to move further usually by
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
the time it's it's at the assistant
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
director's door she is emphatic yet
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
polite and calm and saying
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
you have to seek an attorney we cannot
 
02:05:37.589 --> 02:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
advise you even if it pains us to not be
 
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
able to tell you we know what you might
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
what you should do maybe you know based
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
on the law but we cannot advise and our
 
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
staff from secretary to investigators to
 
02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
paralegal very clear we cannot
 
02:05:54.310 --> 02:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
give legal advice
 
02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
02:05:59.690 --> 02:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
i love that smile
 
02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:01.350 align:start position:0%
i love that smile
[Laughter]

02:06:01.350 --> 02:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
sitting here listening to all this out
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
of curiosity how many
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
ballpark calls come in that you just say
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
you're in the wrong department or that
 
02:06:16.069 --> 02:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
that really um are just somebody that
 
02:06:17.830 --> 02:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
feels that they've been
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
dis inherited or just
 
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know the word i'm trying to think of
 
02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:22.790 align:start position:0%
you know the word i'm trying to think of
um

02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
but it really is not falling into what
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
you do does that happen often and you
 
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
have a filter for that
 
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's a great question i do not have
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
even an anecdotal number um for you but
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
to answer so to sort of answer the
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
question um yes we do so uh if in time
 
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
with the intake person their job is
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
really to listen and understand
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh where the person fits into our
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
statute um sometimes it's a it's a
 
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
situation that it's workplace bullying
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
right so the person is having harassment
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
happen but it is not based on a
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
protected class status so that isn't
 
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
anything that we could help them with i
 
02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
mean sadly right who wants to be bullied
 
02:07:07.109 --> 02:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
at work when you have to be there eight
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
hours a day
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
but that would be something that we are
 
02:07:12.629 --> 02:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
pretty clear that that's not within our
 
02:07:12.639 --> 02:07:14.229 align:start position:0%
pretty clear that that's not within our
statute

02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a wages and hours issue
 
02:07:20.709 --> 02:07:20.719 align:start position:0%
and so we would certainly refer them to
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh to the department of labor to have
 
02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
that conversation so if it's something
 
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
that is clearly not within our statute
 
02:07:29.189 --> 02:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of information
 
02:07:31.589 --> 02:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
gathering there at the beginning for
 
02:07:31.599 --> 02:07:33.109 align:start position:0%
gathering there at the beginning for
intake

02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
intake
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
to try to determine are you in the right
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
place and if you're not then we do have
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
a book of
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
numbers and people that we can refer
 
02:07:45.030 --> 02:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
people to so we do our best to help them
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me to refer them to the place
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
where they probably should be but if the
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
person is emphatic that it belongs here
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
there's a questionnaire they can pull it
 
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
offline fill it out and send it in and
 
02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
then we can take another look
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
you asked for two minutes of testimony i
 
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
think we're there
 
02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony you're
 
02:08:09.910 --> 02:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
welcome and thank everyone for their
 
02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:11.350 align:start position:0%
welcome and thank everyone for their
patience

02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
patience
 
02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:28.159 --> 02:08:36.069 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:08:36.069 --> 02:08:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
a turn
 
02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:39.030 align:start position:0%
a turn
oh

02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:40.390 align:start position:0%
oh
okay

02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
task one completed
 
02:08:44.790 --> 02:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman thank you
 
02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for having me here
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
today my name is megan douglas
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
i'm an attorney in private practice i
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
represent exclusively employees
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
including before the commission
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
and i've witnessed firsthand the problem
 
02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill
 
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
would address
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
before i
 
02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
talk a bit about the problem from my
 
02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:10.639 align:start position:0%
perspective i just wanted to
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
refer back to testimony that director
 
02:09:15.189 --> 02:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
maliki just gave
 
02:09:15.199 --> 02:09:16.629 align:start position:0%
maliki just gave
she

02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:16.639 align:start position:0%
she
 
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
described referring an employee with a
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
wage an hour issue
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
or some other retaliation issue
 
02:09:29.669 --> 02:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important for the
 
02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:33.990 align:start position:0%
committee to
remember

02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
remember
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
that that employee
 
02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
who doesn't have a claim that can be
 
02:09:40.149 --> 02:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
addressed at the commission
 
02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
but does have a claim that can be
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
addressed at the department of labor
 
02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
that employee
 
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
has the right under our statutes
 
02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:50.229 align:start position:0%
has the right under our statutes
to

02:09:50.229 --> 02:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
be heard
 
02:09:51.599 --> 02:09:52.709 align:start position:0%
be heard
fully

02:09:52.709 --> 02:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
fully
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
at the department of labor and the
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
so i i think that's an interesting
 
02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
um comparison
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
to to keep in mind
 
02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.470 align:start position:0%
to to keep in mind
um

02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay the problem the fairness problem
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
um i hope you'll indulge me i
 
02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
i used to be a a middle s a middle
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
school teacher and so i i tend to maybe
 
02:10:21.750 --> 02:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
reduce things
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
complex problems to
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
simple concepts
 
02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:26.390 align:start position:0%
simple concepts
um

02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
here here is what i've come come up with
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
02:10:32.239 --> 02:10:34.229 align:start position:0%
in this case
um

02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:34.239 --> 02:10:35.430 align:start position:0%
um
imagine

02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
02:10:37.750 --> 02:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
you're playing a board game a
 
02:10:40.069 --> 02:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
complicated board game
 
02:10:42.310 --> 02:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
like monopoly
 
02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:43.350 align:start position:0%
like monopoly
and

02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:45.510 --> 02:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
you're playing for
 
02:10:48.149 --> 02:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
a good amount of time you're making some
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
progress you're moving your way around
 
02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599 align:start position:0%
the board
 
02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
you're managing some setbacks
 
02:10:57.990 --> 02:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
um but you're applying the rules
 
02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
you're doing what you need to do
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
to prevail in the game
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
and you get to the very end of the board
 
02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:06.629 align:start position:0%
and you get to the very end of the board
game

02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
game
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
where you have to make the final push
 
02:11:09.679 --> 02:11:12.069 align:start position:0%
where you have to make the final push
to

02:11:12.069 --> 02:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:12.079 --> 02:11:13.189 align:start position:0%
 
prevail

02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
prevail
 
02:11:13.199 --> 02:11:14.229 align:start position:0%
prevail
and

02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
to make
 
02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:17.030 align:start position:0%
to make
your

02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
case as it were to mix the metaphor a
 
02:11:21.030 --> 02:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:11:24.550 --> 02:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
now imagine that your opponent
 
02:11:26.470 --> 02:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
is allowed
 
02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
and make you start all over again
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
and not
 
02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
start all over again playing monopoly
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
but playing a different game
 
02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:41.270 align:start position:0%
but playing a different game
which

02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:11:44.550 --> 02:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
you may not fully understand
 
02:11:45.990 --> 02:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
and which
 
02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.030 align:start position:0%
and which
you

02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:11:50.790 --> 02:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
may not be equipped to play
 
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's the fairness problem
 
02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:55.669 align:start position:0%
that's the fairness problem
um

02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:57.669 --> 02:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
i prepared a chart
 
02:11:59.910 --> 02:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh for you
 
02:12:02.069 --> 02:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
to to show you what
 
02:12:02.079 --> 02:12:02.790 align:start position:0%
to to show you what
the

02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:04.709 align:start position:0%
the
um

02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:04.719 --> 02:12:05.510 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
the board flipping
 
02:12:08.950 --> 02:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
at the commission specifically and it
 
02:12:13.030 --> 02:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
describes the process
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
that director maliki
 
02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
already um
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know verbally described to you
 
02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:21.510 align:start position:0%
you know verbally described to you
um

02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:24.709 --> 02:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
we imagine a pro se plaintiff his name
 
02:12:29.109 --> 02:12:29.119 align:start position:0%
is jason
 
02:12:31.270 --> 02:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
he's suffering
 
02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:32.709 align:start position:0%
he's suffering
racial

02:12:32.709 --> 02:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
racial
 
02:12:35.669 --> 02:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
harassment by his co-workers
 
02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
he's still employed
 
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
but he has a right to file a complaint
 
02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
at the new hampshire commission for
 
02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
human rights to try to get some relief
 
02:12:48.069 --> 02:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
so that he can continue to stay employed
 
02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
without without discrimination
 
02:12:54.390 --> 02:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
um so he he calls up the commission and
 
02:12:56.629 --> 02:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
he asks the commission the intake worker
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
to take
 
02:13:00.229 --> 02:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
to to take his information and the
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
intake worker as director malachi
 
02:13:02.639 --> 02:13:03.990 align:start position:0%
intake worker as director malachi
describes

02:13:03.990 --> 02:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
describes
 
02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.109 align:start position:0%
describes
will

02:13:05.109 --> 02:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:13:07.669 --> 02:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
assist in the in the preparation of a
 
02:13:09.589 --> 02:13:09.599 align:start position:0%
complaint albeit
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
simply a neutral uh recitation of the
 
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
facts as reported
 
02:13:17.350 --> 02:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
and then an investigator is assigned
 
02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
an investigator uh interviews jason
 
02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
asks jason to produce records
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
asks jason to produce witnesses and it
 
02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
is it is um some work
 
02:13:31.679 --> 02:13:32.550 align:start position:0%
is it is um some work
uh

02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:36.310 --> 02:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
then the investigator asks the employer
 
02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:37.109 align:start position:0%
then the investigator asks the employer
for

02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:37.119 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:13:40.229 --> 02:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
um information for witnesses for records
 
02:13:42.149 --> 02:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
and sometimes the investigator has to
 
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
come back to jason and say jason what do
 
02:13:47.589 --> 02:13:47.599 align:start position:0%
you think about this this evidence uh
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
that the employer
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
um submitted that says that you know we
 
02:13:54.149 --> 02:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
you weren't really being criticized for
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
your uh religious clothing you were
 
02:13:58.870 --> 02:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
being criticized because
 
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
by your co-workers because
 
02:14:04.390 --> 02:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
you weren't performing very well and you
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
were holding the team back
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
and jason has to has to rebut that
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of this process which may
 
02:14:14.550 --> 02:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
take one to two years and remember jason
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
is still employed trying to hold on to
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
his job
 
02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:20.629 align:start position:0%
his job
um

02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
the investigator decides
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
you know what jason
 
02:14:27.669 --> 02:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
you may not have won the monopoly game
 
02:14:27.679 --> 02:14:28.790 align:start position:0%
you may not have won the monopoly game
yet

02:14:28.790 --> 02:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
yet
 
02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
but you
 
02:14:32.069 --> 02:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
do have enough
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
such that you might
 
02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
and that's the probable cause finding
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
and the probable cause finding
 
02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
gets communicated to the employer and
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
the employer says whoa wait a minute
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
wait a minute i have a do-over right i
 
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
play the do-over card
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
so i don't want to settle my case
 
02:14:52.709 --> 02:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
at the commission
 
02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
i don't want to have a hearing
 
02:14:57.669 --> 02:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
at the commission i know
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
that my do-over card will make things
 
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
very challenging for jason in court
 
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to play it
 
02:15:07.589 --> 02:15:07.599 align:start position:0%
well what happens to jason
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
jason quits
 
02:15:12.069 --> 02:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
because he can't he can't handle this
 
02:15:12.079 --> 02:15:13.669 align:start position:0%
because he can't he can't handle this
anymore

02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
or he has to go to court
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
um and his case especially if it's one
 
02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
of harassment
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
which regrettably
 
02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know is not um typically understood
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
to be a very lucrative claim he may not
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
be able to get an attorney who can
 
02:15:32.550 --> 02:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
afford to help him
 
02:15:34.550 --> 02:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
and that's not right
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
it's just not right
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
so i'll be happy to take any questions
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative chase thank you
 
02:15:46.149 --> 02:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
guess i didn't realize that there
 
02:15:50.069 --> 02:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
weren't attorneys that were offered so
 
02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
there isn't any um
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
like if you i've known
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
never really been to court to have a um
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
a um what is it called you know a
 
02:15:59.119 --> 02:16:00.310 align:start position:0%
a um what is it called you know a
supplied

02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
supplied
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
attorney what does it call when you if
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
you don't have yeah quite a thank you
 
02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
court appointed chur attorney so in this
 
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
scenario there is nothing like that you
 
02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
have to be able to afford an attorney in
 
02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
order to
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
really fulfill your
 
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:24.069 --> 02:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
i just have a question and that is uh we
 
02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
heard uh from mr jujube at the very
 
02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
beginning about
 
02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
and his argument basically is an
 
02:16:33.349 --> 02:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
argument of fairness that
 
02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
you should you only allow one party to
 
02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
appeal shouldn't both parties have that
 
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity i guess the question i have
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
for you is
 
02:16:45.669 --> 02:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
should either party be what if you
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
took the legislation and said neither
 
02:16:47.439 --> 02:16:48.309 align:start position:0%
took the legislation and said neither
party

02:16:48.309 --> 02:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
party
 
02:16:50.790 --> 02:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
each party is going to be required
 
02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
to accept the decision of the human
 
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
rights commission
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
i think that's what
 
02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
sb 296 would do
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:17:03.669 --> 02:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
it would uh
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
establish that if probable cause
 
02:17:08.950 --> 02:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
is found
 
02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
at the commission to which is a you know
 
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's a preliminary finding
 
02:17:20.469 --> 02:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
that the plaintiff
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
um has a case has has merit
 
02:17:26.950 --> 02:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
that the plaintiff therefore gets to
 
02:17:28.950 --> 02:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
elect to
 
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
stay at the commission or or move to
 
02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:32.790 align:start position:0%
stay at the commission or or move to
court

02:17:32.790 --> 02:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:17:36.309 --> 02:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
but the the defendant the employer
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
does does not have the ability to
 
02:17:42.549 --> 02:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
remove to court aft
 
02:17:46.950 --> 02:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.030 --> 02:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
well if i could just but
 
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
but still
 
02:17:53.910 --> 02:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
the complainant has the ability to
 
02:17:56.070 --> 02:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
remove the case to the superior court if
 
02:17:58.230 --> 02:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
they want to at that time so
 
02:18:00.549 --> 02:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
what if neither party were able to do
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
that they have to abide by whatever the
 
02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
final decision of the civil rights
 
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:08.549 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
um frankly i
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
i've been thinking about this bill
 
02:18:15.429 --> 02:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
through the lens of the pro se plaintiff
 
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
um i
 
02:18:18.629 --> 02:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:18:18.639 --> 02:18:21.270 align:start position:0%
i i
um

02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
frank i don't see any issue with a
 
02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:25.429 align:start position:0%
frank i don't see any issue with a
plaintiff

02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
plaintiff
 
02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
trying the matter
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
before a neutral body
 
02:18:33.110 --> 02:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
that is the commission that's i believe
 
02:18:35.349 --> 02:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
seven commissioners appointed by the
 
02:18:38.230 --> 02:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
governor i have no reason to think that
 
02:18:41.349 --> 02:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
the the the decision by the new
 
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire human rights commission would
 
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
be any
 
02:18:46.950 --> 02:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
less any more biased or
 
02:18:50.070 --> 02:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
less valid or legitimate um or accurate
 
02:18:51.429 --> 02:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
or just
 
02:18:52.629 --> 02:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
than a jury
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
um as i as i've um alluded to at the
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
beginning of my testimony a
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
whistleblower can try their case fully
 
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
at the department before a single
 
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
hearing officer
 
02:19:06.870 --> 02:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
at least at the commission you've got a
 
02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:07.750 align:start position:0%
at least at the commission you've got a
body

02:19:07.750 --> 02:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
body
 
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
of people who have to
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
come to the same conclusion
 
02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%

the uh the charge because they do a
 
02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
better job
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.389 --> 02:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you for your testimony
 
02:21:07.750 --> 02:21:07.760 align:start position:0%

good morning good morning

for 33 years
and

02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's fair to say that i've had
 
02:21:49.270 --> 02:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds of cases before the new
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire commission
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
and i speak in opposition to this bill
 
02:21:57.030 --> 02:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
i want to start off by saying however
 
02:21:57.040 --> 02:21:58.389 align:start position:0%
i want to start off by saying however
that

02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
i truly appreciate the efforts of the
 
02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:01.190 align:start position:0%
i truly appreciate the efforts of the
commission

02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
and what they're charged to do
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
and executive director malachi and i'm
 
02:22:07.910 --> 02:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
not trying to curry favor
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
even though i do have many cases up
 
02:22:09.359 --> 02:22:11.030 align:start position:0%
even though i do have many cases up
there

02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
she's done an exceptional job at trying
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
as she said to streamline the process
 
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
and move things along
 
02:22:18.790 --> 02:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
she also mentioned that
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
the under statute and under the fepa
 
02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
which is a a cooperative agreement with
 
02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
the eeoc
 
02:22:27.190 --> 02:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
what case is a dual filed
 
02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
as attorney douglas just referenced
 
02:22:32.070 --> 02:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire commission has an
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
agreement where they investigate on
 
02:22:36.070 --> 02:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of the eoc
 
02:22:37.910 --> 02:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
and it's within two years and as a
 
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
funding exchange in that regard
 
02:22:42.630 --> 02:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
sadly because the staff the staffing of
 
02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:43.429 align:start position:0%
sadly because the staff the staffing of
the

02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
agency as such
 
02:22:47.830 --> 02:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
and the funding is such that cases don't
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
move through the system in two years
 
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
they don't move this through the system
 
02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
typically in three years i just had a
 
02:22:54.830 --> 02:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
case with the decision it was filed in
 
02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:56.630 align:start position:0%
case with the decision it was filed in
2017

02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
2017
 
02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
five years
 
02:22:58.080 --> 02:22:59.349 align:start position:0%
five years
and

02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
justice delayed is justice denied
 
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
in many regards and i heard a lot of
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
comments and questions in that regard
 
02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:07.030 align:start position:0%
comments and questions in that regard
um

02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:08.710 --> 02:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
one quick comment also with regard to
 
02:23:09.910 --> 02:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
the department of labor because i'm a
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
frequent flyer there
 
02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:12.469 align:start position:0%
frequent flyer there
uh

02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:14.550 --> 02:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
that you have if you have a wage claim
 
02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
you can file it either it before the new
 
02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire commission i'm sorry before
 
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
the department of labor or in superior
 
02:23:22.469 --> 02:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
court either party can do that
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
and uh and then there's appeal rights to
 
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
the superior to the supreme court
 
02:23:27.760 --> 02:23:29.030 align:start position:0%
the superior to the supreme court
um

02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
in essence
 
02:23:31.910 --> 02:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
my testimony is focused on one thing and
 
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
that is fairness mr juve mentioned that
 
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
others have mentioned that as well
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
by taking away the respondents ability
 
02:23:40.389 --> 02:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
to remove this matter
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh after a probable cause finding and i
 
02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
want to talk about that in a second
 
02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh is effectively unfair because the
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
complainant can remove it after 180 days
 
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
before the commission and in my
 
02:23:51.760 --> 02:23:52.710 align:start position:0%
before the commission and in my
experience

02:23:52.710 --> 02:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
experience
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes do
 
02:23:55.750 --> 02:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
but remember a lot of these cases are
 
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
taken on a contingent fee basis and it
 
02:23:59.429 --> 02:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
make it's more cost effective to leave
 
02:24:01.110 --> 02:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
it before the commission
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
um there was there are comments earlier
 
02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:03.670 align:start position:0%
um there was there are comments earlier
about

02:24:03.670 --> 02:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:24:05.910 --> 02:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of going to court going to
 
02:24:07.510 --> 02:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
court a plaintiff typically will be on a
 
02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
contingent fee basis it's on an hourly
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
basis like on the other side
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
but it is effectively it would be uh
 
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
lopsided one side where one party can
 
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
remove a court and the other could not
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
and remember a probable cause finding
 
02:24:22.950 --> 02:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean an absolute it means 51
 
02:24:24.309 --> 02:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
percent by a preponderance of the
 
02:24:25.510 --> 02:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
evidence so what is a proponent of the
 
02:24:27.190 --> 02:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
evidence it could be based upon written
 
02:24:29.110 --> 02:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
submissions and in recent years there
 
02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
have been cases and this is not a
 
02:24:32.469 --> 02:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
criticism or disparagement of the the
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
commission investigators sometimes they
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
don't get to invest to to talk to the
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
witnesses i've had that in several cases
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
they base it on written submissions
 
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
they're absolutely overwhelmed and while
 
02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
there was a pause or a delay with covid
 
02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
on average the commission receives uh
 
02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
more than 200 charges a year
 
02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
so if there's a delay in the system
 
02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
referencing what um executive director
 
02:24:56.469 --> 02:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
malachi said
 
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
i think there would be a burden further
 
02:24:59.590 --> 02:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
on the commission you're not going to
 
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
expedite cases it's going to push it out
 
02:25:03.670 --> 02:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
even further so take that case that's
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
been there for five years and then
 
02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
sitting down for a hearing
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
no benefit to either party in that
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
regard and in in my case or in cases
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
that we've had you've got witnesses that
 
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
either relocate or memories fade and the
 
02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:16.950 align:start position:0%
either relocate or memories fade and the
like

02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:25:19.270 --> 02:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
this bill would not improve that system
 
02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
at all at all and if there is an
 
02:25:23.429 --> 02:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to improve the system there
 
02:25:24.870 --> 02:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
many ways and i know that that's been
 
02:25:26.230 --> 02:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
looked at and there have been there's
 
02:25:28.230 --> 02:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
been progress this bill would not do
 
02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:29.510 align:start position:0%
been progress this bill would not do
that

02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:25:31.110 --> 02:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
in fact with regard to the hearing
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
process before the commission
 
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
my estimation is as i looked at the
 
02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
record since 1974 there have been 76
 
02:25:40.469 --> 02:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
hearings before the commission so in
 
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
nearly 50 years
 
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
76 hearings
 
02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's not a lot and the other is
 
02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the fact that the
 
02:25:50.070 --> 02:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
commissioners are indeed volunteers
 
02:25:51.349 --> 02:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
but they're not lawyers and they're not
 
02:25:53.510 --> 02:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
judges they're lay people goodly people
 
02:25:55.270 --> 02:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
good professionals but they're they
 
02:25:58.469 --> 02:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
don't have the uh the the um formality
 
02:26:00.389 --> 02:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
that you might have in court rules of
 
02:26:02.389 --> 02:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
evidence uh and the like and going
 
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
through the system
 
02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:05.990 align:start position:0%
through the system
um

02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
again hundreds of cases filed
 
02:26:11.110 --> 02:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
the statute says three years again some
 
02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:11.990 align:start position:0%
the statute says three years again some
older

02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
older
 
02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.270 align:start position:0%
older
uh

02:26:13.270 --> 02:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:15.990 --> 02:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think the um
 
02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
under the current system the system
 
02:26:19.510 --> 02:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
effectively works if there's a pc
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
finding yes it's not being forced you
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to remove the
 
02:26:24.389 --> 02:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
matter to court and it's a de novo
 
02:26:27.990 --> 02:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
hearing if this bill were successful
 
02:26:29.429 --> 02:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
there would not be a de novo hearing
 
02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
meaning start over again or have a fresh
 
02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
look at the evidence it would be based
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
on the uh errors of law and that's a
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
very narrow field so um effectively
 
02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh and i think it was the reference from
 
02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:42.710 align:start position:0%
uh and i think it was the reference from
from

02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
mr jave earlier is i think that
 
02:26:47.349 --> 02:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
more time and based upon the many
 
02:26:49.270 --> 02:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
questions today i think more time is
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
taken to send this back to
 
02:26:52.950 --> 02:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
if if the bill were not killed going to
 
02:26:54.710 --> 02:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
interim study committee to consider this
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
further there's a lot to unpack here
 
02:27:00.389 --> 02:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
talking about the process how it a
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
charge is filed how it's investigated
 
02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
the hearing process and some of the
 
02:27:07.270 --> 02:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
statistics that were referenced earlier
 
02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
i have a lot of anecdotal evidence but
 
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to take up any of your
 
02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
time in that regard
 
02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
just based upon my experience i think
 
02:27:16.070 --> 02:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
while perhaps this was well intended i
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
think it would actually clog the system
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
much more and it would also take away
 
02:27:21.990 --> 02:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
the fairness that we referenced earlier
 
02:27:23.270 --> 02:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
one last point
 
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's a constitutional argument here
 
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
when you have state and federal claims
 
02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
filed before the commission if the
 
02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:30.469 align:start position:0%
filed before the commission if the
commission

02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
under this proposed uh system issued an
 
02:27:35.349 --> 02:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh a probable cause finding and you had
 
02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
to go before the the commission for a
 
02:27:39.270 --> 02:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
what about the federal claim that
 
02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
they're also investigating that claim if
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
there's a probable cause finding you
 
02:27:47.270 --> 02:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
have 90 days to file in federal court
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
and start over again
 
02:27:50.469 --> 02:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
and that is a de novo hearing in that
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
process so you would have a
 
02:27:54.150 --> 02:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional problem with with uh the
 
02:27:55.590 --> 02:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
state law claim effectively being
 
02:27:57.750 --> 02:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
adjudicated and the federal clock claim
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
often the same claim just under two
 
02:28:01.270 --> 02:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
different statutes
 
02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
having a a fresh look so
 
02:28:06.070 --> 02:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
again that could be a delay in the
 
02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:09.110 align:start position:0%
again that could be a delay in the
system

02:28:09.110 --> 02:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
questions for attorney reedy
 
02:28:14.630 --> 02:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
represent mclean
 
02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so um
 
02:28:18.630 --> 02:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
even if
 
02:28:21.910 --> 02:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
resources could be applied to accelerate
 
02:28:23.349 --> 02:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
the process
 
02:28:23.359 --> 02:28:24.870 align:start position:0%
the process
and

02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
we were
 
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
to eliminate across the board removal um
 
02:28:32.790 --> 02:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
for uh after finding a probable cause
 
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
you there you still have
 
02:28:37.030 --> 02:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
problems with the mechanism even then
 
02:28:39.670 --> 02:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
because of
 
02:28:42.150 --> 02:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
access to the courts beyond that
 
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
is that correct so even if we were to to
 
02:28:46.469 --> 02:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
do those amendments to to streamline and
 
02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
to address the resource concerns and to
 
02:28:51.510 --> 02:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
make the removal fair across the board
 
02:28:53.110 --> 02:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
you still have concerns with the
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism thanks for the question but
 
02:28:56.309 --> 02:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
just to be clear when you say
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
streamlined to make it fair across the
 
02:28:59.429 --> 02:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
board are you saying neither party can
 
02:29:01.750 --> 02:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
remove or both parties can remove
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
so resource issues to accelerate the
 
02:29:05.910 --> 02:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
process because you talked about i
 
02:29:07.830 --> 02:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
brought in a claim in 2017 is just being
 
02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
resolved now
 
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
so that resource issues on the one side
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
um and also basically yes exactly nobody
 
02:29:18.469 --> 02:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
can remove it after a probable cause
 
02:29:21.750 --> 02:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
hearing including the claimant so if
 
02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:23.270 align:start position:0%
hearing including the claimant so if
those

02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:29:24.469 --> 02:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
if the
 
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
legislation was amended to basically
 
02:29:29.190 --> 02:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
address those two things my
 
02:29:31.510 --> 02:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
understanding you still have concerns
 
02:29:32.710 --> 02:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
with the mechanism on other
 
02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional grounds etc that's
 
02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
correct and i think i would summarize it
 
02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
this way the right to jury trial the the
 
02:29:40.389 --> 02:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
hearing before the commission would not
 
02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
be a jury trial and that doesn't again
 
02:29:43.510 --> 02:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
not to not to be critical of the
 
02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
commissioners in the public hearing
 
02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
process but you you should have a right
 
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
to a jury trial and then uh the other is
 
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh under the if you have a dual filing
 
02:29:53.270 --> 02:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
you would have that right under the
 
02:29:54.389 --> 02:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
federal system and you would have a
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
conflict between state and federal law
 
02:29:57.910 --> 02:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
and there'd be a question as to whether
 
02:30:00.070 --> 02:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
or not there was any any any uh whether
 
02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
or not the state law decision could be
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
entered into evidence in the federal
 
02:30:07.030 --> 02:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
and i have at least one federal court
 
02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
decision where this says there is no
 
02:30:10.389 --> 02:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
prohibitive value that the the federal
 
02:30:12.389 --> 02:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
court did not accept the because of the
 
02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
highly prejudicial nature of uh of the
 
02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
of a probable cause finding and it was
 
02:30:22.389 --> 02:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:24.309 --> 02:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:30:27.349 --> 02:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
so yeah can i just ask how long
 
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
on the on the average
 
02:30:32.230 --> 02:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
from your experience does it take to get
 
02:30:34.950 --> 02:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
from the time of a filing of a complaint
 
02:30:37.830 --> 02:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
to a probable cause finding
 
02:30:39.429 --> 02:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
uh at a minimum
 
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
thanks for a question at a minimum at
 
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
least three years uh more like in recent
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
years closer to four and or perhaps more
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
and if i could just follow up so
 
02:30:55.990 --> 02:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
so it that it seems difficult
 
02:30:59.590 --> 02:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
to accept at least that somebody has to
 
02:30:59.600 --> 02:31:01.190 align:start position:0%
to accept at least that somebody has to
wait

02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
wait
 
02:31:03.750 --> 02:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
three years to get to a probable cause
 
02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:05.030 align:start position:0%
three years to get to a probable cause
finding

02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
finding
 
02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:05.830 align:start position:0%
finding
and

02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
having done so gotten to that point then
 
02:31:10.790 --> 02:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
making a decision to remove it to
 
02:31:13.510 --> 02:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
another venue
 
02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:14.469 align:start position:0%
another venue
and

02:31:14.469 --> 02:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:17.270 --> 02:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
is it possible that
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
the parties could elect to go to the
 
02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
superior court at an earlier point in
 
02:31:25.030 --> 02:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
the process not waiting until you get to
 
02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
that point well that's what the
 
02:31:28.790 --> 02:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
complainants have right now after 180
 
02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
days before the commission so six months
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
they can remove the matter to federation
 
02:31:35.670 --> 02:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
to uh state court uh they could actually
 
02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
move them out of to federal court as
 
02:31:41.429 --> 02:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
so why why not apply the same standard
 
02:31:44.560 --> 02:31:46.070 align:start position:0%
so why why not apply the same standard
to

02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:31:46.080 --> 02:31:47.270 align:start position:0%
to
the

02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:49.270 --> 02:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
the the subject of the complaint the
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
respondents i i would applaud that if
 
02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
you have that opportunity again because
 
02:31:54.870 --> 02:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
under the under the system in uh the
 
02:31:56.389 --> 02:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of labor whether
 
02:31:59.030 --> 02:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's a whistleblower or a wage claim
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
you have the opportunity to elect
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
to be to go to the department of labor
 
02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
or to superior court
 
02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just relating it to small claims
 
02:32:09.270 --> 02:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
cases because i'm a small claims judge
 
02:32:12.550 --> 02:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
but basically you have a limited period
 
02:32:14.230 --> 02:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
if you want to remove to the superior
 
02:32:16.790 --> 02:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
court you have a limited period of time
 
02:32:20.550 --> 02:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
to do that up front as opposed to
 
02:32:22.150 --> 02:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
you don't make a finding and then decide
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
to remove it to the court and get it in
 
02:32:25.750 --> 02:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
oval here right department of labor you
 
02:32:27.830 --> 02:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
you've got within the statute to to file
 
02:32:29.270 --> 02:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
your claim
 
02:32:31.429 --> 02:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
under the discrimination statutes before
 
02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire commission for human
 
02:32:35.590 --> 02:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
rights and the eeoc you've got 180 days
 
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
from the last event of discrimination to
 
02:32:39.270 --> 02:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
file the claim or if you're filing both
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
under federal and state law you've got
 
02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
300 days so 10 months
 
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
at a maximum to file your claim and then
 
02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
it once filed with the commission in a
 
02:32:49.590 --> 02:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
dual filing you've got 180 days as a
 
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
complainant to remove that matter to
 
02:32:53.830 --> 02:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
court that was that's after 180 days so
 
02:32:55.349 --> 02:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
anytime after 100 days you can remove
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
that matter there's no maximum you can
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
do it by this point
 
02:33:01.270 --> 02:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
because you've already filed with the
 
02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:04.469 align:start position:0%
because you've already filed with the
commission

02:33:04.469 --> 02:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
 
02:33:10.469 --> 02:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the uh is it these
 
02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
respondents that you're uh that you're
 
02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
working uh working for they typically
 
02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:18.950 align:start position:0%
working uh working for they typically
um

02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:20.870 --> 02:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
companies that have um
 
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
internal procedures in place to deal
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
conflicts in the workplace um either
 
02:33:27.670 --> 02:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
because they're a larger organization
 
02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
and or the
 
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
workers have a union or otherwise
 
02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
protected or these
 
02:33:33.670 --> 02:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
mostly things where everything is
 
02:33:35.510 --> 02:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
informal and they kind of comes out of
 
02:33:37.030 --> 02:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
the blue for the respondent and then
 
02:33:38.389 --> 02:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
they have to go
 
02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
over and hire hire you to get them out
 
02:33:41.910 --> 02:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
02:33:43.830 --> 02:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
deal with the complaint which i would of
 
02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
course applaud but um
 
02:33:48.790 --> 02:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
the area of employment law workplace law
 
02:33:52.469 --> 02:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
since the time i started practicing in
 
02:33:55.429 --> 02:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
1989 has evolved significantly
 
02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
gone are the days of the wild wild west
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
where you're just an at-will employee
 
02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
you have no rights you think of the
 
02:34:02.550 --> 02:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
litany of of employment laws on a state
 
02:34:03.990 --> 02:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
and federal level that have been adopted
 
02:34:06.710 --> 02:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
since 1990 and they're significant with
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
that employers have responded by having
 
02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's in a union environment a
 
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
non-union environment public sector
 
02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
private sector large or small with early
 
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
resolution the law calls for prompt and
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate investigation and resolution
 
02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
of disputes so uh an employer would be
 
02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
foolhardy if it didn't have that process
 
02:34:25.349 --> 02:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot in this economy to uh
 
02:34:27.750 --> 02:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
recruit and retain talent uh and that's
 
02:34:29.270 --> 02:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
not just true in this economy it's in
 
02:34:31.030 --> 02:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
any economy so
 
02:34:32.710 --> 02:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
you want to make certain that your your
 
02:34:34.150 --> 02:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
workplace is functioning properly but
 
02:34:37.590 --> 02:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
the law calls for that and uh and so
 
02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
in my experience whether we're talking
 
02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
about a small
 
02:34:42.070 --> 02:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
family held business or a large
 
02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
multinational corporation they all have
 
02:34:45.990 --> 02:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
those procedures in place are they
 
02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
foolproof well clearly not because
 
02:34:49.590 --> 02:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
people still aren't may not be satisfied
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
with the result
 
02:34:52.630 --> 02:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
and and they have the opportunity to
 
02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:53.510 align:start position:0%
and and they have the opportunity to
file

02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
file
 
02:34:57.349 --> 02:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:00.150 --> 02:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
other questions representative lorenzo
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr human and thank you for
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:05.670 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:08.550 --> 02:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know we talked about the process
 
02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:09.910 align:start position:0%
you know we talked about the process
um

02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the process it's a
 
02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
volunteer board that makes the decisions
 
02:35:19.349 --> 02:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
would you consider that a strength or a
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
can i say i feel strongly both ways
 
02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
um i i just appreciate the the um the
 
02:35:32.070 --> 02:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
the commissioners that volunteer their
 
02:35:33.349 --> 02:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
time they're all professionals that
 
02:35:35.349 --> 02:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
volunteer their time and their skill
 
02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
sets to uh looking at cases when they
 
02:35:39.349 --> 02:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
can but otherwise there's also an
 
02:35:41.349 --> 02:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
investigating commissioner someone who
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a part of a public hearing
 
02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:43.750 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a part of a public hearing
who

02:35:43.750 --> 02:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:35:45.429 --> 02:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
looks at the investigation and makes
 
02:35:47.670 --> 02:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
suggestions until a decision whether
 
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's probable cause or no probable cause
 
02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh is issued so
 
02:35:53.349 --> 02:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
i think there's a benefit to the
 
02:35:55.349 --> 02:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
commission certainly uh uh yeah there
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
are ways to improve yes i think that the
 
02:35:59.349 --> 02:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
improvements would be focused on as
 
02:36:01.750 --> 02:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
executive director malachi said uh at
 
02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
the intake and investigation process and
 
02:36:05.349 --> 02:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
that would be the resources that we
 
02:36:09.349 --> 02:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier um but the
 
02:36:11.990 --> 02:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
from my perspective i think the
 
02:36:14.469 --> 02:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
hearing process i in a case i have i can
 
02:36:16.550 --> 02:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
proceed to public hearing if my client
 
02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
if it makes sense in that regard
 
02:36:21.270 --> 02:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
or we can go to court so we have that
 
02:36:22.790 --> 02:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
choice and it's it's on a facts and
 
02:36:25.590 --> 02:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances basis but um so
 
02:36:27.429 --> 02:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
as i said there have been some 76
 
02:36:30.630 --> 02:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
hearings over the last 48 years so
 
02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
parties do elect and including employers
 
02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
don't remove the court and they go to
 
02:36:35.830 --> 02:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
before the so there's that option
 
02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:36.870 align:start position:0%
before the so there's that option
available

02:36:36.870 --> 02:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:36:41.990 --> 02:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:45.510 --> 02:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thanks so
 
02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
much appreciate your three to five
 
02:36:52.389 --> 02:36:52.399 align:start position:0%

and samantha
 
02:37:02.830 --> 02:37:02.840 align:start position:0%

hewning thank you chairman gordon
 
02:37:07.590 --> 02:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk to you today you
 
02:37:10.950 --> 02:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
need to get next to the microphone
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
apologies thank you chairman gordon and
 
02:37:14.389 --> 02:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
committee members for this opportunity
 
02:37:15.910 --> 02:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
to talk with you today my name is
 
02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
samantha hearing i'm an attorney
 
02:37:19.190 --> 02:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
practicing at douglas leonard and garvey
 
02:37:21.429 --> 02:37:21.439 align:start position:0%
in concord new hampshire a large portion
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
of my practice is plaintiff's employment
 
02:37:25.750 --> 02:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
law so we represent the employees
 
02:37:27.429 --> 02:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
i want to focus you in on two points
 
02:37:28.950 --> 02:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of stuff today but i
 
02:37:31.030 --> 02:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
just want to boil it down to fairness
 
02:37:33.190 --> 02:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
and state resources those are the most
 
02:37:34.550 --> 02:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
important things that we have to talk
 
02:37:36.389 --> 02:37:36.399 align:start position:0%
about today
 
02:37:38.469 --> 02:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
um a question was raised why not
 
02:37:40.870 --> 02:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
eliminate the ability of both parties to
 
02:37:42.790 --> 02:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
remove why not just keep everybody at
 
02:37:44.469 --> 02:37:44.479 align:start position:0%
the commission and let them live with
 
02:37:47.270 --> 02:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
what the commission decides
 
02:37:48.870 --> 02:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
i want to answer that by telling you how
 
02:37:50.790 --> 02:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
we got here in the first place
 
02:37:53.349 --> 02:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
354 when the original removal provision
 
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
was put in it was added because
 
02:37:59.110 --> 02:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes plaintiffs have claims that
 
02:38:01.510 --> 02:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
the hrc cannot hear
 
02:38:05.830 --> 02:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
for example wrongful termination claims
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
what would happen in a case where an
 
02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
employee has a claim that's subject to
 
02:38:13.429 --> 02:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
the hrc's process but it also cannot be
 
02:38:15.030 --> 02:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
heard there they would go through the
 
02:38:16.790 --> 02:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
process at the hrc they would then have
 
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
to file the separate claim in court
 
02:38:21.670 --> 02:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
the result of that is telling the hrc
 
02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
and the court the same set of facts the
 
02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
same set of witnesses
 
02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
really trying the case twice just to
 
02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
bring two claims so to eliminate that
 
02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
waste of resources
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
we put in the removal provisions so that
 
02:38:37.030 --> 02:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs can remove their case to
 
02:38:38.870 --> 02:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
court because they have an attorney who
 
02:38:40.469 --> 02:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
says to them look we're going to
 
02:38:42.150 --> 02:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
litigate this case twice we might as
 
02:38:44.150 --> 02:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
well just remove let's make this more
 
02:38:45.990 --> 02:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
efficient for everybody
 
02:38:48.070 --> 02:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
that's how we got here so if we
 
02:38:49.830 --> 02:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
eliminated that removal right for the
 
02:38:51.830 --> 02:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
complainant i feel that we would be
 
02:38:54.309 --> 02:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
wasting our state's resources by
 
02:38:57.110 --> 02:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
having cases litigated at the hrc that
 
02:38:59.110 --> 02:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
could just move through the court system
 
02:39:02.150 --> 02:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
and we would be clogging up the hrc
 
02:39:02.160 --> 02:39:02.950 align:start position:0%
and we would be clogging up the hrc
um

02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:04.950 --> 02:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
i also want to note briefly no one
 
02:39:06.389 --> 02:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
testified against this bill in the
 
02:39:06.399 --> 02:39:07.429 align:start position:0%
testified against this bill in the
senate

02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
senate
 
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
it was passed by voice vote on consent
 
02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:13.830 align:start position:0%
it was passed by voice vote on consent
calendar

02:39:13.830 --> 02:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:15.429 --> 02:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
and i want to talk about the fairness
 
02:39:15.439 --> 02:39:17.190 align:start position:0%
and i want to talk about the fairness
issue

02:39:17.190 --> 02:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:39:19.270 --> 02:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
the united states supreme court long ago
 
02:39:21.270 --> 02:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
held that people who bring claims
 
02:39:22.710 --> 02:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
against someone else
 
02:39:24.389 --> 02:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
it's their right to decide the forum
 
02:39:26.630 --> 02:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
that here that hears their claim it's a
 
02:39:28.950 --> 02:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
long-standing principle in this country
 
02:39:30.550 --> 02:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
i also want to talk about the resource
 
02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
differential between employer and
 
02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:33.670 align:start position:0%
differential between employer and
employee

02:39:33.670 --> 02:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
employee
 
02:39:35.830 --> 02:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
so we've been talking about
 
02:39:38.190 --> 02:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
the data today
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
2015-2021 in a seven-year period there
 
02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:41.990 align:start position:0%
2015-2021 in a seven-year period there
were

02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:39:45.270 --> 02:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
28 times that the respondent removed the
 
02:39:49.349 --> 02:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
case to court after the cause finding
 
02:39:49.359 --> 02:39:50.309 align:start position:0%
case to court after the cause finding
so

02:39:50.309 --> 02:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:51.750 --> 02:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
i can't tell you what happened in each
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
of those 28 cases but i can tell you
 
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
what i see the potential to have been
 
02:39:58.630 --> 02:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
which is that you have somebody like
 
02:40:01.030 --> 02:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
john who's a bus boy at a restaurant
 
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
he's sexually harassed by owner number
 
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
one he goes to owner number two and he
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
complains and he says please help me fix
 
02:40:08.630 --> 02:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
this i just want to work i don't want
 
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
this guy touching me while i'm just
 
02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:15.590 --> 02:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
owner number two doesn't care and
 
02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
nothing happens the harassment continues
 
02:40:20.150 --> 02:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
john either has to keep going to work
 
02:40:22.950 --> 02:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
and endure the sexual harassment
 
02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:24.070 align:start position:0%
and endure the sexual harassment
or

02:40:24.070 --> 02:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
he could decide you know what i'm going
 
02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
to do something about this i'm going to
 
02:40:28.870 --> 02:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
file the human rights commission
 
02:40:31.110 --> 02:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
john quits his job he files at the human
 
02:40:32.870 --> 02:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
rights commission he looks for an
 
02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
attorney to take his case and he gets a
 
02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
new job three weeks later at a new
 
02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:36.870 align:start position:0%
new job three weeks later at a new
restaurant

02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
now john's problem is that when he calls
 
02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
an office like mine
 
02:40:43.110 --> 02:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
i can't take his case because i i have
 
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
to get paid
 
02:40:47.190 --> 02:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
john makes a low wage as a busboy so he
 
02:40:50.230 --> 02:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
can't afford to pay my hourly rate
 
02:40:51.750 --> 02:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
the other problem for john is that he
 
02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
with with three weeks of wage losses and
 
02:40:56.309 --> 02:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
as a low wage earner to begin with
 
02:40:58.630 --> 02:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
he's not going to have the type of wages
 
02:41:00.309 --> 02:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
that would allow me to recover my fees
 
02:41:03.269 --> 02:41:03.279 align:start position:0%
on a contingency contingency fee basis
 
02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
so john's gonna have to do this without
 
02:41:06.309 --> 02:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
an attorney he goes through the
 
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
commission process
 
02:41:09.670 --> 02:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
he convinces the commission that owner
 
02:41:11.349 --> 02:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
number one was touching him while he was
 
02:41:13.349 --> 02:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
trying to clean tables and he gets a
 
02:41:16.389 --> 02:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
probable cost finding but the owners
 
02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to deal with this so they
 
02:41:20.230 --> 02:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
removed to court hoping like attorney
 
02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
douglas testified that this will make it
 
02:41:23.590 --> 02:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
too difficult for john to continue it'll
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
make him start over
 
02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
john does give up he's got to go to
 
02:41:29.429 --> 02:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
college he doesn't have time to deal
 
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
with this he doesn't have the knowledge
 
02:41:32.469 --> 02:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
or the resources
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
what i want to i want to focus not just
 
02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
on the fairness to john issue but i want
 
02:41:38.230 --> 02:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
02:41:40.469 --> 02:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
you representatives what message are we
 
02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
sending to employers
 
02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
if we allow them to do that to employees
 
02:41:45.830 --> 02:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
like john
 
02:41:48.309 --> 02:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
if we give them a sort of
 
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know trump card at the end of the
 
02:41:51.030 --> 02:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
game that they can play to just get
 
02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
themselves out of trouble
 
02:41:56.790 --> 02:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
um i also want to talk
 
02:41:58.870 --> 02:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
talk about um
 
02:42:01.110 --> 02:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
the employers the employer's ability to
 
02:42:03.590 --> 02:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
remove the case doesn't somehow make it
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
more difficult for the employer
 
02:42:07.590 --> 02:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of which forum the employer
 
02:42:09.510 --> 02:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
is in they still have a duty
 
02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:10.389 align:start position:0%
is in they still have a duty
to

02:42:10.389 --> 02:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:42:10.399 --> 02:42:11.269 align:start position:0%
to
plead

02:42:11.269 --> 02:42:11.279 align:start position:0%
plead
 
02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
the employee still has a duty to plead
 
02:42:15.030 --> 02:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
their claims by preponderance of the
 
02:42:17.590 --> 02:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
evidence regardless of the forum
 
02:42:20.230 --> 02:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
so eliminating the employer's ability to
 
02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
remove doesn't change that they still
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
have that the employee still has the
 
02:42:31.510 --> 02:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:33.110 --> 02:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
there was a question earlier from
 
02:42:35.030 --> 02:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative dilorenzo i believe who
 
02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:35.910 align:start position:0%
representative dilorenzo i believe who
asked

02:42:35.910 --> 02:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
asked
 
02:42:37.750 --> 02:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
what about people who have something
 
02:42:40.950 --> 02:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
very egregious happen to them
 
02:42:43.110 --> 02:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
is it possible that these pro se people
 
02:42:44.950 --> 02:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
could give up because they can't go to
 
02:42:46.710 --> 02:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
court and they don't have the resources
 
02:42:48.710 --> 02:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
to deal with this
 
02:42:50.469 --> 02:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
in my experience outside of the small
 
02:42:53.510 --> 02:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
claims arena plaintiffs are not equipped
 
02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
to represent themselves in litigation
 
02:42:57.750 --> 02:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
and that's not to say anything negative
 
02:43:00.150 --> 02:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
about the ordinary citizen but it's just
 
02:43:01.510 --> 02:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
to emphasize
 
02:43:04.309 --> 02:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
the complex process that is filing a
 
02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:11.349 --> 02:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
i also want to talk about some
 
02:43:13.269 --> 02:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
opposition testimony that i heard today
 
02:43:15.910 --> 02:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
at one point i heard testimony that an
 
02:43:17.349 --> 02:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
employer can remove wage and
 
02:43:18.950 --> 02:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
whistleblower claims from the department
 
02:43:20.389 --> 02:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
of labor
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
that's false there is no ability for the
 
02:43:25.110 --> 02:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
employer to remove those claims
 
02:43:27.269 --> 02:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
i also heard testimony that
 
02:43:28.870 --> 02:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
keeping a case at the commission and
 
02:43:30.710 --> 02:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
scheduling it for a hearing will just
 
02:43:32.309 --> 02:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
push the resolution at the commission
 
02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
out farther it'll just keep the timeline
 
02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:35.670 align:start position:0%
out farther it'll just keep the timeline
going

02:43:35.670 --> 02:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
going
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
that's ignoring the reality of the
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
timeline that we experience in court
 
02:43:41.510 --> 02:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
which doesn't fare much better than the
 
02:43:43.510 --> 02:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
commission's timeline
 
02:43:43.520 --> 02:43:45.349 align:start position:0%
commission's timeline
so

02:43:45.349 --> 02:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:43:47.110 --> 02:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
keeping it at the commission and waiting
 
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
for the commission's ability to give you
 
02:43:50.550 --> 02:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
a hearing or moving to court and
 
02:43:53.830 --> 02:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
starting over from scratch
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
keeping it at the commission is not
 
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
going to extend that if anything the
 
02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
timeline of the case is going to be
 
02:43:59.510 --> 02:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
extended by
 
02:44:01.750 --> 02:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
putting it into suit and starting the
 
02:44:03.510 --> 02:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
process over there's a new complaint
 
02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
there's a new answer there's a new
 
02:44:06.870 --> 02:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
schedule for the case there are new
 
02:44:09.670 --> 02:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
people to be questioned there are new
 
02:44:11.750 --> 02:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
questions to be answered it's all from
 
02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:12.950 align:start position:0%
questions to be answered it's all from
scratch

02:44:12.950 --> 02:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
scratch
 
02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
i also want to talk about the
 
02:44:15.590 --> 02:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional argument about the right
 
02:44:17.269 --> 02:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
to a jury trial
 
02:44:17.279 --> 02:44:20.630 align:start position:0%
to a jury trial
um

02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:22.710 --> 02:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
our own new hampshire supreme court
 
02:44:25.110 --> 02:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
decided that the constitutional
 
02:44:27.429 --> 02:44:27.439 align:start position:0%
right to a jury trial does not attach to
 
02:44:29.670 --> 02:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
legal rights that didn't exist back in
 
02:44:33.269 --> 02:44:33.279 align:start position:0%
1794 when our constitution was passed
 
02:44:36.389 --> 02:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
in 1794 we didn't have 354a or the human
 
02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
rights commission meaning there is no
 
02:44:40.389 --> 02:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to a jury trial for
 
02:44:41.910 --> 02:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
those claims that would be heard at the
 
02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:54.790 align:start position:0%
those claims that would be heard at the
commission

02:44:54.790 --> 02:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:56.950 --> 02:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
i think i think uh representatives that
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
concludes all of the points that i
 
02:44:59.750 --> 02:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to make but i'm happy to accept
 
02:45:01.510 --> 02:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
your questions
 
02:45:03.670 --> 02:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative chase it's not
 
02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
really a question i just like i missed
 
02:45:07.990 --> 02:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
your name and where you are from
 
02:45:09.990 --> 02:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
samantha hearing i work with douglas
 
02:45:12.070 --> 02:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
leonard and garvey in concord thank you
 
02:45:15.110 --> 02:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
very much thank you
 
02:45:16.870 --> 02:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:45:19.110 --> 02:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo thank you mr
 
02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you um attorney um
 
02:45:23.670 --> 02:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask you the same question
 
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
that i asked the previous speaker and i
 
02:45:29.830 --> 02:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to get your take on um
 
02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:31.190 align:start position:0%
wanted to get your take on um
the

02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:45:34.150 --> 02:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
human rights commission's process that
 
02:45:36.070 --> 02:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
ends in
 
02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers making a decision um i'd like
 
02:45:43.190 --> 02:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
to hear your take on that thank you
 
02:45:45.030 --> 02:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
i don't have any issue with volunteer
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
and i apologize i can't see very well
 
02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
around this
 
02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:48.389 align:start position:0%
around this
but

02:45:48.389 --> 02:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:45:50.150 --> 02:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
i don't have any problem with volunteers
 
02:45:52.230 --> 02:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
making a decision at the end because the
 
02:45:53.590 --> 02:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
volunteers are provided with the
 
02:45:56.070 --> 02:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
framework of the law that applies as
 
02:45:57.830 --> 02:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
long as that's provided then i think
 
02:45:59.429 --> 02:45:59.439 align:start position:0%
that volunteers can adequately make a
 
02:46:00.790 --> 02:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
decision if they've been presented with
 
02:46:05.269 --> 02:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:46:10.469 --> 02:46:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:12.790 --> 02:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
but if i could just uh
 
02:46:16.230 --> 02:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:18.469 --> 02:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
and as has already been mentioned
 
02:46:23.190 --> 02:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
justice delayed is justice denied and
 
02:46:25.349 --> 02:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
is there
 
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
just in terms of looking at the
 
02:46:29.510 --> 02:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is there a way of allowing
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
both parties to make an option to go to
 
02:46:34.070 --> 02:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
the superior court instead of the human
 
02:46:37.510 --> 02:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
rights commission earlier in the process
 
02:46:39.750 --> 02:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
02:46:42.309 --> 02:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
after a probable cause finding has been
 
02:46:42.319 --> 02:46:44.710 align:start position:0%
after a probable cause finding has been
made

02:46:44.710 --> 02:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
i suppose it would be possible to do
 
02:46:48.150 --> 02:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:46:50.550 --> 02:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
i i believe as the
 
02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
the last uh speaker said
 
02:46:56.710 --> 02:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
at 180 days the uh the complainant can
 
02:46:59.110 --> 02:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
remove to court it's possible that the
 
02:47:00.389 --> 02:47:00.399 align:start position:0%
statute could be amended to give
 
02:47:02.630 --> 02:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
respondents that same ability
 
02:47:03.670 --> 02:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
i think what we're still going to
 
02:47:06.150 --> 02:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
experience in that case is a resource
 
02:47:08.230 --> 02:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
differential between the parties
 
02:47:09.750 --> 02:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
when we have
 
02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:11.190 align:start position:0%
when we have
small

02:47:11.190 --> 02:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
small
 
02:47:13.349 --> 02:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
employees who don't have a lot of wages
 
02:47:16.230 --> 02:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
can't get a lawyer versus a company who
 
02:47:18.870 --> 02:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
even if a mom-and-pop shop has some more
 
02:47:20.550 --> 02:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
resources at their disposal than that
 
02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:23.030 align:start position:0%
resources at their disposal than that
employee

02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
employee
 
02:47:26.550 --> 02:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
by by forcing the employee into court
 
02:47:29.110 --> 02:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
or even earlier in the process denies
 
02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
the employee from pursuing claims that
 
02:47:32.830 --> 02:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
we've decided
 
02:47:37.030 --> 02:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
um are warranted under our laws
 
02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:38.389 align:start position:0%
um are warranted under our laws
right

02:47:38.389 --> 02:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:47:41.830 --> 02:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:44.630 --> 02:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
so and i get the issue that uh the human
 
02:47:46.389 --> 02:47:46.399 align:start position:0%
rights commission is something that may
 
02:47:48.630 --> 02:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
may be more user-friendly particularly
 
02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
to pro-save litigants
 
02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:51.990 align:start position:0%
to pro-save litigants
and

02:47:51.990 --> 02:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:47:53.910 --> 02:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
less intimidating than going to the
 
02:47:55.510 --> 02:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
02:47:57.670 --> 02:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
so i get i get that
 
02:47:57.680 --> 02:47:59.030 align:start position:0%
so i get i get that
um

02:47:59.030 --> 02:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:02.070 --> 02:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
and i get the idea that
 
02:48:03.750 --> 02:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
you wait to a probable cause hearing
 
02:48:06.070 --> 02:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
which might be from what i understand
 
02:48:07.830 --> 02:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
out three years
 
02:48:11.349 --> 02:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
and then the employer or respondent
 
02:48:13.990 --> 02:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
at that point in time has the ability to
 
02:48:17.269 --> 02:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
basically have a de novo process
 
02:48:17.279 --> 02:48:18.150 align:start position:0%
basically have a de novo process
so

02:48:18.150 --> 02:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:20.070 align:start position:0%
so
which

02:48:20.070 --> 02:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:48:22.150 --> 02:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
just seems to delay everything so what
 
02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:23.030 align:start position:0%
just seems to delay everything so what
if

02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:48:25.190 --> 02:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
what if
 
02:48:28.469 --> 02:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
the parties uh if you wanted if
 
02:48:30.309 --> 02:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
once once you file the human rights
 
02:48:32.150 --> 02:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
commission the complainant is committed
 
02:48:33.590 --> 02:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
to be at the human rights commission
 
02:48:35.269 --> 02:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
they can't remove
 
02:48:37.429 --> 02:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
but you give
 
02:48:40.790 --> 02:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
the employer the right to say that if
 
02:48:43.910 --> 02:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
within 90 days after having received a
 
02:48:46.389 --> 02:48:46.399 align:start position:0%
complaint you have the right to have it
 
02:48:49.670 --> 02:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
removed to the superior court
 
02:48:52.950 --> 02:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
for a jury trial or whatever else
 
02:48:56.469 --> 02:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
instead of that whole three-year delay
 
02:48:58.150 --> 02:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
would that be something that would be
 
02:49:00.950 --> 02:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:03.429 --> 02:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:49:04.950 --> 02:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
see i
 
02:49:06.630 --> 02:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
my issue representative is that i don't
 
02:49:08.469 --> 02:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
see a lack of fairness for the employer
 
02:49:08.479 --> 02:49:09.750 align:start position:0%
see a lack of fairness for the employer
here

02:49:09.750 --> 02:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:10.790 align:start position:0%
here
because

02:49:10.790 --> 02:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:49:12.550 --> 02:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court has held
 
02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
that they're not entitled to that jury
 
02:49:15.670 --> 02:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
trial in court anyway
 
02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
and because the united states supreme
 
02:49:20.550 --> 02:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
court has held that the person who files
 
02:49:21.990 --> 02:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
the claim is the person who has the
 
02:49:24.230 --> 02:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
right to decide which forum hears it not
 
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
the other way around so i don't i don't
 
02:49:27.190 --> 02:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
see the fairness issue based on our
 
02:49:28.870 --> 02:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
court's precedence
 
02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:29.910 align:start position:0%
court's precedence
um

02:49:29.910 --> 02:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
but that's something that certainly the
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
stat that could happen the statute could
 
02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
be amended in the fashion that you
 
02:49:37.670 --> 02:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
suggest i would again come back to
 
02:49:40.630 --> 02:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
the unfairness that would result to
 
02:49:42.630 --> 02:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
people who can't get an attorney to
 
02:49:44.070 --> 02:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
handle their claims
 
02:49:45.910 --> 02:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
and it's it's
 
02:49:48.950 --> 02:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's less about uh court being
 
02:49:51.750 --> 02:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
intimidating and more about just
 
02:49:54.309 --> 02:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
i'll be candid i'm a new attorney i
 
02:49:55.910 --> 02:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
still don't know everything that i'm
 
02:49:55.920 --> 02:49:56.950 align:start position:0%
still don't know everything that i'm
doing

02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:49:59.590 --> 02:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
i still have to ask my colleagues daily
 
02:50:01.349 --> 02:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
for assistance with the litigation
 
02:50:01.359 --> 02:50:03.110 align:start position:0%
for assistance with the litigation
process

02:50:03.110 --> 02:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:50:04.630 --> 02:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
i can't imagine
 
02:50:06.710 --> 02:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
not having the education and background
 
02:50:08.469 --> 02:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
and assistance that i have and trying to
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
proceed through this process without all
 
02:50:12.630 --> 02:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
that it would be impossible
 
02:50:14.790 --> 02:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
um the other thing i want to emphasize
 
02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
too is that one of the great advantages
 
02:50:18.309 --> 02:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
of the human rights commission to
 
02:50:19.910 --> 02:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
employers is that the process is
 
02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:21.190 align:start position:0%
employers is that the process is
confidential

02:50:21.190 --> 02:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
you don't have to experience bad
 
02:50:25.510 --> 02:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
publicity for claims that may be without
 
02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:26.870 align:start position:0%
publicity for claims that may be without
merit

02:50:26.870 --> 02:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
merit
 
02:50:28.469 --> 02:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
you can keep things confidential at the
 
02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
commission and let things be decided
 
02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:31.030 align:start position:0%
commission and let things be decided
there

02:50:31.030 --> 02:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:50:35.510 --> 02:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's also informal easy to deal with
 
02:50:38.070 --> 02:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
and very very cost effective compared to
 
02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:40.230 align:start position:0%
and very very cost effective compared to
court

02:50:40.230 --> 02:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:50:41.990 --> 02:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:50:44.870 --> 02:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:50:46.309 --> 02:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
saying then thank you for your testimony
 
02:50:50.070 --> 02:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
today thank you
 
02:51:05.590 --> 02:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
i was just checking to see if i was
 
02:51:08.469 --> 02:51:08.479 align:start position:0%
going to say good morning or good
 
02:51:10.790 --> 02:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon but we're still in the morning
 
02:51:12.870 --> 02:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone my name is beth
 
02:51:15.510 --> 02:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
daragon i'm an attorney an employment
 
02:51:18.389 --> 02:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
law attorney at pass story crayons in
 
02:51:20.469 --> 02:51:20.479 align:start position:0%
concord new hampshire and for the record
 
02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
i'm from boston
 
02:51:23.990 --> 02:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
i always like to note that
 
02:51:25.510 --> 02:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:51:27.429 --> 02:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to spend a lot of time
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
repeating the testimony that's gone
 
02:51:31.830 --> 02:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
forward but i would like to spend a
 
02:51:35.030 --> 02:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
little bit of time clarifying some of
 
02:51:37.190 --> 02:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
the remarks that have been made for a
 
02:51:39.190 --> 02:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
start i think it might be helpful for
 
02:51:41.510 --> 02:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
you to know that i represent both
 
02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:42.870 align:start position:0%
you to know that i represent both
employees

02:51:42.870 --> 02:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:51:44.790 --> 02:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
and employers
 
02:51:47.830 --> 02:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
have done so for about 16 years so
 
02:51:47.840 --> 02:51:49.349 align:start position:0%
have done so for about 16 years so
currently

02:51:49.349 --> 02:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:51:52.070 --> 02:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
i was trying to tally the number in my
 
02:51:54.469 --> 02:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
head but i think currently at the
 
02:51:56.710 --> 02:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
commission for human rights i have an
 
02:51:59.269 --> 02:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
equal number of clients who are on the
 
02:52:02.230 --> 02:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
complainant side and an equal number who
 
02:52:04.550 --> 02:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
are on the respondent's side
 
02:52:07.590 --> 02:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
so i can uh you know at least give you
 
02:52:10.150 --> 02:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
what i like to think is a well-balanced
 
02:52:10.160 --> 02:52:10.950 align:start position:0%
what i like to think is a well-balanced
view

02:52:10.950 --> 02:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
view
 
02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:11.710 align:start position:0%
view
of

02:52:11.710 --> 02:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:52:14.950 --> 02:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
representation of both in the same forum
 
02:52:17.269 --> 02:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
in the process
 
02:52:21.269 --> 02:52:21.279 align:start position:0%
i uh testify here today in opposition to
 
02:52:22.469 --> 02:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:52:24.790 --> 02:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
and my biggest issue
 
02:52:29.190 --> 02:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
is that this denies
 
02:52:30.389 --> 02:52:30.399 align:start position:0%
the jury
 
02:52:30.399 --> 02:52:31.590 align:start position:0%
the jury
process

02:52:31.590 --> 02:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:52:34.230 --> 02:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
to my respondent clients
 
02:52:36.630 --> 02:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
so to my respondent clients who are the
 
02:52:39.670 --> 02:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
recipients of a charge of discrimination
 
02:52:42.710 --> 02:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
and ask me okay beth now what's going to
 
02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
happen what's the process here
 
02:52:47.830 --> 02:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
currently i'll say to them well
 
02:52:50.550 --> 02:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
we will stay at the commission and have
 
02:52:53.110 --> 02:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
to stay at the commission until there's
 
02:52:55.830 --> 02:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
a probable cause or no probable cause
 
02:52:59.349 --> 02:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
finding as you've heard earlier today
 
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
and then they say and then what happens
 
02:53:05.110 --> 02:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
well at that point we have a choice we
 
02:53:07.030 --> 02:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
can proceed with a hearing at the
 
02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:08.070 align:start position:0%
can proceed with a hearing at the
commission

02:53:08.070 --> 02:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:08.870 align:start position:0%
commission
or

02:53:08.870 --> 02:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:53:11.269 --> 02:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
we can remove to court
 
02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
now to my complainant clients
 
02:53:17.190 --> 02:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
ask me the same question beth what's the
 
02:53:17.200 --> 02:53:18.309 align:start position:0%
ask me the same question beth what's the
process

02:53:18.309 --> 02:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:53:18.319 --> 02:53:19.429 align:start position:0%
process
well

02:53:19.429 --> 02:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:53:23.750 --> 02:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
um here's the process after 180 days
 
02:53:25.670 --> 02:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
because cases as you've heard are
 
02:53:28.150 --> 02:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
pending at the commission for a lengthy
 
02:53:30.630 --> 02:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
period of time and that's no criticism
 
02:53:32.469 --> 02:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
of the commission i interned at the
 
02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
commission as a law student and had was
 
02:53:36.950 --> 02:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
one of those intake
 
02:53:40.230 --> 02:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
um folks who had to listen to the the
 
02:53:41.830 --> 02:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
types of folks who were calling in and
 
02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
asking whether or not they had
 
02:53:47.110 --> 02:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh viable claims so uh my heart is
 
02:53:48.870 --> 02:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
always there at the commission i'm
 
02:53:52.070 --> 02:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
actually a mediator as well for the
 
02:53:54.389 --> 02:53:54.399 align:start position:0%
commission for human rights site so i
 
02:53:57.510 --> 02:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
wear many hats but for my complainants
 
02:53:59.110 --> 02:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
i can say
 
02:54:02.950 --> 02:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
okay well after 180 days we've reached a
 
02:54:02.960 --> 02:54:04.469 align:start position:0%
okay well after 180 days we've reached a
juncture

02:54:04.469 --> 02:54:04.479 align:start position:0%
juncture
 
02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
we can decide
 
02:54:10.070 --> 02:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not we want to file in court
 
02:54:12.550 --> 02:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
and avail ourselves
 
02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:13.429 align:start position:0%
and avail ourselves
of

02:54:13.429 --> 02:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:54:15.750 --> 02:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
typical discovery practices
 
02:54:18.790 --> 02:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
right depositions interrogatories
 
02:54:21.590 --> 02:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
requests for production of documents
 
02:54:23.910 --> 02:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
can and is it worth us to avail
 
02:54:26.070 --> 02:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
ourselves as though on the complainant
 
02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
side oftentimes it is because the
 
02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:30.070 align:start position:0%
side oftentimes it is because the
complainants

02:54:30.070 --> 02:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
complainants
 
02:54:31.429 --> 02:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
02:54:32.950 --> 02:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
the records
 
02:54:36.230 --> 02:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
right the employer has the records
 
02:54:38.550 --> 02:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
oftentimes strategically it is a good
 
02:54:41.110 --> 02:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
idea to remove we want to understand
 
02:54:43.349 --> 02:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
what the employer has we want to know
 
02:54:45.590 --> 02:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
what records they have what emails what
 
02:54:47.349 --> 02:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
text messages
 
02:54:49.429 --> 02:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
how else are we going to get them how
 
02:54:51.830 --> 02:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
else am i going to assess the case
 
02:54:54.469 --> 02:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes strategically it is worth
 
02:54:56.230 --> 02:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
making that move
 
02:54:58.389 --> 02:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
but my complainants
 
02:55:00.950 --> 02:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
have the right and opportunity to do
 
02:55:04.389 --> 02:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
that and they have the right to be heard
 
02:55:07.670 --> 02:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
in front of a jury of their peers and to
 
02:55:10.870 --> 02:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
have the case adjudicated applying the
 
02:55:12.710 --> 02:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
rules of evidence
 
02:55:15.830 --> 02:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
my respondent clients if this bill were
 
02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
to go into law
 
02:55:20.469 --> 02:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
would lose that ability they have no
 
02:55:23.190 --> 02:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
right to a jury trial they have no right
 
02:55:26.630 --> 02:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
to be heard by their peers they have no
 
02:55:29.190 --> 02:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
right to a strict application of the
 
02:55:31.110 --> 02:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
rules of evidence
 
02:55:34.469 --> 02:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
that's a huge disparity in my view i
 
02:55:37.429 --> 02:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
represent both sides i'm looking at it
 
02:55:40.550 --> 02:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
from both sides but as an attorney i
 
02:55:42.550 --> 02:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
have a big issue
 
02:55:44.389 --> 02:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
with one side
 
02:55:47.590 --> 02:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
being denied equal equal justice before
 
02:55:50.230 --> 02:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
the law and to be able to be heard by a
 
02:55:53.349 --> 02:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
jury of their peers i just want to make
 
02:55:55.510 --> 02:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
a a couple of
 
02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:56.630 align:start position:0%
a a couple of
points

02:55:56.630 --> 02:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
points
 
02:55:59.110 --> 02:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
attorney reedy earlier
 
02:56:01.190 --> 02:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
specified and stated about the new
 
02:56:03.030 --> 02:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of labor process in
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
regard to wage claims
 
02:56:04.800 --> 02:56:05.590 align:start position:0%
regard to wage claims
the

02:56:05.590 --> 02:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:56:09.510 --> 02:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
filing party can elect whether or not to
 
02:56:11.590 --> 02:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
file at the new hampshire department of
 
02:56:14.870 --> 02:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
labor or in superior court that's an
 
02:56:17.349 --> 02:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
election that that can be made it's not
 
02:56:18.630 --> 02:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
a removal
 
02:56:21.190 --> 02:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
issue that's that's not the statement
 
02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
that he made
 
02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:56:27.190 --> 02:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
for those reasons i'm opposed to the
 
02:56:30.550 --> 02:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
bill i want to see both parties be able
 
02:56:33.830 --> 02:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
to make informed decisions strategic
 
02:56:37.110 --> 02:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
decisions that are based on
 
02:56:40.070 --> 02:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
their own considerations and be able to
 
02:56:42.469 --> 02:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
be heard by a jury of their peers if
 
02:56:45.190 --> 02:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
they so choose and i thank you very much
 
02:56:47.429 --> 02:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
for your time i am still well within my
 
02:56:49.750 --> 02:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
15 minutes and i'd be happy to answer
 
02:56:52.389 --> 02:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:56:55.429 --> 02:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
hey are representing mclean
 
02:56:56.790 --> 02:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:56:58.469 --> 02:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:57:00.950 --> 02:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
02:57:04.230 --> 02:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things at the core of uh
 
02:57:06.550 --> 02:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
attorney hearings support behind the
 
02:57:08.630 --> 02:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
bill she was just talking a lot about
 
02:57:10.389 --> 02:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
the resource delta
 
02:57:13.750 --> 02:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
that exists between the the employer
 
02:57:16.710 --> 02:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
and the claimant and and she stressed
 
02:57:19.510 --> 02:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
that in many cases it might not even be
 
02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
possible for a claimant to be able to
 
02:57:24.870 --> 02:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
get representation and she kind of went
 
02:57:26.150 --> 02:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
through the arguments for why that would
 
02:57:27.030 --> 02:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
be so
 
02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
you however represent an equal balance
 
02:57:33.190 --> 02:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
of employers and claimants um
 
02:57:35.349 --> 02:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
in in the in the case that she brought
 
02:57:37.830 --> 02:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
forth where i have a busboy who is
 
02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:38.790 align:start position:0%
forth where i have a busboy who is
very

02:57:38.790 --> 02:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:57:38.800 --> 02:57:39.670 align:start position:0%
very
uh

02:57:39.670 --> 02:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:57:41.910 --> 02:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
low compensation
 
02:57:43.910 --> 02:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
is there any claimant within your
 
02:57:47.510 --> 02:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
clientele that would is at that level or
 
02:57:49.510 --> 02:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to get a feel to to
 
02:57:51.429 --> 02:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
understand the weight of that argument
 
02:57:53.510 --> 02:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
for the resources
 
02:57:55.190 --> 02:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:58:00.230 --> 02:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
damages that can be awarded
 
02:58:03.910 --> 02:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
under title 7 and under 350 4a don't
 
02:58:07.429 --> 02:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
only include lost wages and future lost
 
02:58:10.630 --> 02:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
wages it also includes compensatory
 
02:58:10.640 --> 02:58:12.150 align:start position:0%
wages it also includes compensatory
damages

02:58:12.150 --> 02:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
damages
 
02:58:15.750 --> 02:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
so that when an attorney is assessing
 
02:58:18.469 --> 02:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
the viability of a claim and i'd be
 
02:58:21.190 --> 02:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
happy to take the the prior example of
 
02:58:25.190 --> 02:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
the busboy who was assaulted essentially
 
02:58:27.990 --> 02:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
at work right he was inappropriately
 
02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:29.190 align:start position:0%
at work right he was inappropriately
touched

02:58:29.190 --> 02:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
touched
 
02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:29.990 align:start position:0%
touched
er

02:58:29.990 --> 02:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
er
 
02:58:32.389 --> 02:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
that and and most likely
 
02:58:35.269 --> 02:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
suffered emotional distress damages as a
 
02:58:38.790 --> 02:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
result it may be true that he doesn't
 
02:58:41.830 --> 02:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
make a lot of money it may be true that
 
02:58:45.670 --> 02:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
the lost wages calculation is low but
 
02:58:47.670 --> 02:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
you know what could be high
 
02:58:49.830 --> 02:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
the compensatory damages that's
 
02:58:53.349 --> 02:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
egregious conduct when someone touches
 
02:58:55.990 --> 02:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
someone inappropriately and if there are
 
02:58:58.550 --> 02:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
enough facts and evidence to support
 
02:58:58.560 --> 02:58:59.429 align:start position:0%
enough facts and evidence to support
that

02:58:59.429 --> 02:58:59.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:59:00.950 --> 02:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
then um
 
02:59:00.960 --> 02:59:02.070 align:start position:0%
then um
i

02:59:02.070 --> 02:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:59:02.080 --> 02:59:02.870 align:start position:0%
i
i

02:59:02.870 --> 02:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:59:05.269 --> 02:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
i question whether or not there is an
 
02:59:07.030 --> 02:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
attorney in the state of new hampshire
 
02:59:10.230 --> 02:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
who would who would shy necessarily not
 
02:59:14.230 --> 02:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
take that case just based on lost wages
 
02:59:15.590 --> 02:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:59:17.190 --> 02:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
but that gives me an opportunity to give
 
02:59:19.830 --> 02:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
you a real life example too so years ago
 
02:59:22.230 --> 02:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
when i was at upton in hatfield and i
 
02:59:25.510 --> 02:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
was a new lawyer there
 
02:59:28.950 --> 02:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
a client came in who had a no probable
 
02:59:31.190 --> 02:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
cause finding from the commission
 
02:59:33.269 --> 02:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
and she was pro se
 
02:59:35.990 --> 02:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
she came in and spoke with heather burns
 
02:59:39.190 --> 02:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
who was a partner and is to this day at
 
02:59:42.950 --> 02:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
the firm and pitched her case to us we
 
02:59:44.469 --> 02:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
took the case
 
02:59:46.950 --> 02:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
no probable cause finding she was a pro
 
02:59:49.910 --> 02:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
se client took the case went to federal
 
02:59:51.990 --> 02:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
court and we prevailed
 
02:59:55.269 --> 02:59:55.279 align:start position:0%
and so um i give that as an example
 
02:59:58.389 --> 02:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
because it is not all doom and gloom we
 
03:00:01.830 --> 03:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
do have real cases and real examples of
 
03:00:03.030 --> 03:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
pro se
 
03:00:05.830 --> 03:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
pro se litigants being at the commission
 
03:00:08.309 --> 03:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
even getting a no probable cause finding
 
03:00:11.110 --> 03:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
in their attorneys who will assess the
 
03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
case on the merits and make um judgment
 
03:00:16.469 --> 03:00:16.479 align:start position:0%
calls about the viability of those
 
03:00:16.479 --> 03:00:19.110 align:start position:0%
calls about the viability of those
claims

03:00:19.110 --> 03:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:20.710 --> 03:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:00:22.150 --> 03:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
03:00:24.630 --> 03:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much um
 
03:00:26.309 --> 03:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
and i could say i missed the beginning
 
03:00:27.670 --> 03:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
of your presentation what your name was
 
03:00:31.269 --> 03:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
bertha what dario close beth daragon
 
03:00:34.230 --> 03:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
just not dragon just a theory
 
03:00:36.790 --> 03:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
one letter makes a difference yes you
 
03:00:38.230 --> 03:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
have a lifetime experience you've played
 
03:00:40.790 --> 03:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
you've got to spell your name like um
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
when the um
 
03:00:44.309 --> 03:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
so when you're
 
03:00:45.990 --> 03:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
if you're working for a responding
 
03:00:48.550 --> 03:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
client and they come to you are they
 
03:00:50.790 --> 03:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
typically surprised that this complaint
 
03:00:53.110 --> 03:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
is you know come across their desk and
 
03:00:54.309 --> 03:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh or
 
03:00:56.309 --> 03:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
or are they typically something where
 
03:00:57.750 --> 03:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
there's been a
 
03:00:59.590 --> 03:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
long-running conflict in the workplace
 
03:01:01.910 --> 03:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
and other avenues internal avenues have
 
03:01:05.429 --> 03:01:05.439 align:start position:0%
been explored and um didn't work out
 
03:01:07.030 --> 03:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's a mixed bag
 
03:01:09.190 --> 03:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know thank you it's a mixed bag
 
03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes um
 
03:01:15.630 --> 03:01:15.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes where it's a client who i have
 
03:01:18.309 --> 03:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
represented through a complaint and
 
03:01:20.389 --> 03:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
internal complaint process
 
03:01:23.349 --> 03:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
and they've conducted an investigation
 
03:01:25.110 --> 03:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
03:01:27.670 --> 03:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
there's still the possibility that when
 
03:01:29.990 --> 03:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
the client leaves the workforce they
 
03:01:31.910 --> 03:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
still might file a charge of
 
03:01:35.030 --> 03:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination and those instances it's
 
03:01:37.510 --> 03:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know we receive notice of the charge
 
03:01:38.950 --> 03:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
and say oh
 
03:01:41.030 --> 03:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know we thought you know that was
 
03:01:44.790 --> 03:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
all handled well and whatever but um we
 
03:01:47.590 --> 03:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
know where that's coming from but then i
 
03:01:50.070 --> 03:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
have clients who
 
03:01:52.790 --> 03:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
are just you know they had no idea that
 
03:01:54.870 --> 03:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
this was coming and
 
03:01:57.910 --> 03:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
um the person hadn't raised any issues
 
03:01:59.910 --> 03:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
in the workplace and the first they hear
 
03:02:01.190 --> 03:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
a bit is
 
03:02:03.590 --> 03:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
in a charge that's been filed
 
03:02:05.269 --> 03:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
and the other point i wanted just to
 
03:02:09.110 --> 03:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
make it occurred to me in terms of
 
03:02:11.990 --> 03:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
cost to the employer i do think it's
 
03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
important to understand the insurance
 
03:02:15.830 --> 03:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
piece of this
 
03:02:15.840 --> 03:02:17.190 align:start position:0%
piece of this
not

03:02:17.190 --> 03:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:02:20.510 --> 03:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
i there may be a misunderstanding or a
 
03:02:23.429 --> 03:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
misapprehension that employers all have
 
03:02:26.150 --> 03:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
coverage for these types of claims
 
03:02:27.990 --> 03:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage
 
03:02:30.389 --> 03:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
it's not covered under their general
 
03:02:33.429 --> 03:02:33.439 align:start position:0%
liability practice coverage unless they
 
03:02:38.309 --> 03:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
have a separate employment liability
 
03:02:41.110 --> 03:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
program coverage insurance program they
 
03:02:44.150 --> 03:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
don't have insurance for the claim i
 
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
have several clients now
 
03:02:49.750 --> 03:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
where they do not have insurance
 
03:02:53.190 --> 03:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
coverage i have one client now does have
 
03:02:56.230 --> 03:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage the deductible is 75
 
03:02:56.240 --> 03:02:58.389 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage the deductible is 75
000.

03:02:58.389 --> 03:02:58.399 align:start position:0%
000.
 
03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
so that's not really coverage so
 
03:03:03.590 --> 03:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
um so i just i want to raise that
 
03:03:06.870 --> 03:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
because there there is a cost to the
 
03:03:08.950 --> 03:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
employer they're not all covered by
 
03:03:10.790 --> 03:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
insurance and even if they are covered
 
03:03:12.469 --> 03:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
by insurance
 
03:03:15.830 --> 03:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there is a sizable deduction
 
03:03:19.510 --> 03:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:23.110 --> 03:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:24.870 --> 03:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you very
 
03:03:27.269 --> 03:03:27.279 align:start position:0%

03:03:29.269 --> 03:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
15 minutes to testify sometimes you get
 
03:03:33.030 --> 03:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:34.950 --> 03:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
there was i did receive one additional
 
03:03:44.070 --> 03:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:45.910 --> 03:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon representatives i don't
 
03:03:45.920 --> 03:03:46.630 align:start position:0%
good afternoon representatives i don't
like

03:03:46.630 --> 03:03:46.640 align:start position:0%

03:03:48.630 --> 03:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
being between you and your lunch um for
 
03:03:52.469 --> 03:03:52.479 align:start position:0%

03:03:54.230 --> 03:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
my name is marissa chase for the record
 
03:03:55.510 --> 03:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'm the executive director of the new
 
03:03:57.110 --> 03:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire association for justice a
 
03:03:58.710 --> 03:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
statewide professional association of

trial attorneys um both megan douglas
 
03:04:02.469 --> 03:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
and samantha herring are members of our
 
03:04:05.030 --> 03:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
organization and we requested this bill
 
03:04:07.510 --> 03:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
be introduced by senator french
 
03:04:10.150 --> 03:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
samantha mentioned um we had not heard
 
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
of any opposition to this bill this
 
03:04:14.469 --> 03:04:14.479 align:start position:0%
session um there was no testimony in
 
03:04:16.630 --> 03:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
opposition in the senate i had not
 
03:04:19.269 --> 03:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
received any indication that um
 
03:04:21.830 --> 03:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know this this had opposition so i'm
 
03:04:23.670 --> 03:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
a little surprised today
 
03:04:23.680 --> 03:04:24.790 align:start position:0%
a little surprised today
um

03:04:24.790 --> 03:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:24.800 --> 03:04:25.750 align:start position:0%
um
but

03:04:25.750 --> 03:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:04:28.389 --> 03:04:28.399 align:start position:0%
as always we are willing to work with
 
03:04:29.990 --> 03:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders if there can be a
 
03:04:32.550 --> 03:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
compromise i don't know that that's
 
03:04:34.469 --> 03:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
possible on this issue but mr chair you
 
03:04:36.950 --> 03:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
know i like to try
 
03:04:38.309 --> 03:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i just want to point
 
03:04:41.110 --> 03:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
out one thing that attorney daragon said
 
03:04:42.389 --> 03:04:42.399 align:start position:0%
you know in new hampshire we experience
 
03:04:44.870 --> 03:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
conservative juries it's overwhelmingly
 
03:04:47.349 --> 03:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
common that emotional distress damages
 
03:04:49.750 --> 03:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
um that mragon spoke of
 
03:04:51.349 --> 03:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
for the busboy example are not given
 
03:04:53.590 --> 03:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
weight by our juries one mechanism for
 
03:04:55.110 --> 03:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
judging the amount of emotional distress
 
03:04:56.950 --> 03:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
damages is by
 
03:04:59.190 --> 03:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
looking at lost wages so
 
03:05:02.230 --> 03:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
again i think i've said this before
 
03:05:04.309 --> 03:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
probably a hundred times to some of you
 
03:05:06.870 --> 03:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire these cases are taken
 
03:05:09.830 --> 03:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
by contingency fee that means that the
 
03:05:12.230 --> 03:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
lawyer just fronts all the costs of
 
03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
litigation and does not get paid by the
 
03:05:17.429 --> 03:05:17.439 align:start position:0%
client until and unless they prevail
 
03:05:19.910 --> 03:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
that is an enormous risk assessment that
 
03:05:22.230 --> 03:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
lawyers especially a small firm have to
 
03:05:22.240 --> 03:05:24.150 align:start position:0%
lawyers especially a small firm have to
make

03:05:24.150 --> 03:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
make
 
03:05:24.160 --> 03:05:25.510 align:start position:0%
make
so

03:05:25.510 --> 03:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:05:26.950 --> 03:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of our plaintiff's attorneys i can
 
03:05:28.550 --> 03:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
tell you on our list serve where we have
 
03:05:30.469 --> 03:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
over 500 members
 
03:05:32.309 --> 03:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
that talk about these issues there's an
 
03:05:33.830 --> 03:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
employment law practice group in the
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
state as well called neela
 
03:05:37.910 --> 03:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming amount of plaintiff's
 
03:05:40.389 --> 03:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
lawyers in this state do unfortunately
 
03:05:42.710 --> 03:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
turn away many complainants and we do
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
see a lot of pro se litigants
 
03:05:47.429 --> 03:05:47.439 align:start position:0%
that are removed to superior court after
 
03:05:48.950 --> 03:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
a probable cause finding at the human
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%

03:05:52.710 --> 03:05:52.720 align:start position:0%

something i hear frequently
 
03:06:04.870 --> 03:06:04.880 align:start position:0%

and i am the prime sponsor of senate
 
04:01:34.469 --> 04:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
bill 302
 
04:01:34.479 --> 04:01:35.670 align:start position:0%
bill 302
um

04:01:35.670 --> 04:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:38.229 --> 04:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
the objective of
 
04:01:42.710 --> 04:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
the objective of 302 is basically
 
04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
sorry i have the wrong
 
04:01:47.030 --> 04:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
list um
 
04:01:48.790 --> 04:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
was basically to
 
04:01:51.510 --> 04:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that donors names are
 
04:01:53.110 --> 04:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
kept private
 
04:01:55.269 --> 04:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:01:58.870 --> 04:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
this comes on the heels of
 
04:01:58.880 --> 04:02:00.630 align:start position:0%
this comes on the heels of
one

04:02:00.630 --> 04:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:02:02.710 --> 04:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
supreme court decision that was made
 
04:02:04.469 --> 04:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
recently in
 
04:02:04.479 --> 04:02:07.110 align:start position:0%
recently in
um

04:02:07.110 --> 04:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:10.229 --> 04:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
afp versus bonta and also in 19 i
 
04:02:12.710 --> 04:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
believe it was a 1956
 
04:02:17.110 --> 04:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:20.469 --> 04:02:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:22.630 --> 04:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
and basically what it does is it
 
04:02:24.389 --> 04:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
protects the donors
 
04:02:28.229 --> 04:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
and of those on 501c3s
 
04:02:31.830 --> 04:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
it does not impact any
 
04:02:31.840 --> 04:02:33.189 align:start position:0%
it does not impact any
elect

04:02:33.189 --> 04:02:33.199 align:start position:0%

so
 
04:03:18.550 --> 04:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:23.590 --> 04:03:23.600 align:start position:0%

behind me that can be a little bit more
 
04:03:52.309 --> 04:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
detailed on the um the piece of
 
04:03:52.319 --> 04:03:55.189 align:start position:0%
detailed on the um the piece of
legislation

04:03:55.189 --> 04:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:56.389 --> 04:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative horgan did you have a
 
04:03:58.550 --> 04:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
question um we have
 
04:04:01.110 --> 04:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
we have many 501c organizations
 
04:04:04.309 --> 04:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
administering state programs um
 
04:04:05.750 --> 04:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps most famously the new
 
04:04:07.269 --> 04:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
educational uh
 
04:04:09.910 --> 04:04:09.920 align:start position:0%

protect the uh taxpayers right to make
 
04:04:16.389 --> 04:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
sure that the money that these 501cs are
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%

seeing them thank you senator thank you
 
04:04:41.269 --> 04:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:43.429 --> 04:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
good afternoon i have written testimony
 
04:04:45.990 --> 04:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
would you like me to present us now
 
04:04:48.229 --> 04:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
yes if you just give it to
 
04:04:49.830 --> 04:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative merner and he'll make
 
04:04:56.070 --> 04:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:57.910 --> 04:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
mr chair members of the committee my
 
04:05:00.150 --> 04:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
name is diane quinlan i'm the assistant
 
04:05:01.830 --> 04:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
director of charitable trust at the
 
04:05:03.670 --> 04:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
04:05:05.910 --> 04:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to express our opposition
 
04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
to senate bill 302
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
we recognize that one of the purposes of
 
04:05:14.070 --> 04:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 302 was to encourage
 
04:05:14.080 --> 04:05:16.389 align:start position:0%
senate bill 302 was to encourage
philanthropy

04:05:16.389 --> 04:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
philanthropy
 
04:05:19.429 --> 04:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
it's a goal that our office shares
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
but we are concerned that this bill
 
04:05:24.309 --> 04:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
would actually have the opposite effect
 
04:05:26.630 --> 04:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
the bill would mean less transparency in
 
04:05:27.910 --> 04:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
the governance of charitable
 
04:05:27.920 --> 04:05:29.349 align:start position:0%
the governance of charitable
organizations

04:05:29.349 --> 04:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
04:05:31.110 --> 04:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
and will make it more difficult for our
 
04:05:33.150 --> 04:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
office to fulfill our oversight
 
04:05:35.670 --> 04:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so that donors can have
 
04:05:37.990 --> 04:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
more confidence that their donations are
 
04:05:41.590 --> 04:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
used for their intended purposes
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
when i'm going to be brief because i've
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony but when
 
04:05:49.110 --> 04:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
considering this bill
 
04:05:50.790 --> 04:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that the ultimate
 
04:05:53.429 --> 04:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
beneficiary of charitable nonprofits is
 
04:05:55.830 --> 04:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
the public and the public therefore has
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
an interest in them and the attorney
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
general's responsibility to protect the
 
04:06:02.070 --> 04:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
public's interest in charitable
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
organizations is grounded in common law
 
04:06:08.309 --> 04:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
well before 1943 when the legislature
 
04:06:10.710 --> 04:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
enacted a law establishing the director
 
04:06:13.189 --> 04:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
of charitable trusts as an office that's
 
04:06:15.269 --> 04:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
wholly dedicated to the oversight of
 
04:06:17.030 --> 04:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts and charitable
 
04:06:17.040 --> 04:06:19.189 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts and charitable
organizations

04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
04:06:21.030 --> 04:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's also important to note that the
 
04:06:23.590 --> 04:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
vast majority of members of governing
 
04:06:25.670 --> 04:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
boards of charitable non-profit
 
04:06:29.830 --> 04:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
corporation organizations are volunteers
 
04:06:31.990 --> 04:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
while the bill was amended in the senate
 
04:06:34.309 --> 04:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
to allow our office to request the names
 
04:06:37.189 --> 04:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
of board members in annual reports
 
04:06:39.510 --> 04:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended would not allow our
 
04:06:41.429 --> 04:06:41.439 align:start position:0%
office to request the names of board
 
04:06:42.870 --> 04:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
members in connection with the
 
04:06:45.269 --> 04:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
registration process when charities
 
04:06:47.269 --> 04:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
register with our office
 
04:06:49.510 --> 04:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
this is a time when we're often able to
 
04:06:52.229 --> 04:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
catch and can address things like
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest transactions
 
04:06:57.030 --> 04:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
pecuniary benefit transactions and
 
04:07:00.070 --> 04:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
address issues regarding whether or not
 
04:07:01.510 --> 04:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
the board is
 
04:07:01.520 --> 04:07:02.950 align:start position:0%
the board is
composed

04:07:02.950 --> 04:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
composed
 
04:07:04.790 --> 04:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
in accordance with
 
04:07:06.790 --> 04:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
state law
 
04:07:08.710 --> 04:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
this bill would also prohibit other
 
04:07:10.870 --> 04:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
public agencies from requesting the
 
04:07:12.950 --> 04:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
names of volunteer board members and
 
04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
would prohibit all public agencies
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
including our office
 
04:07:19.349 --> 04:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
from disclosing those names in public
 
04:07:19.359 --> 04:07:20.710 align:start position:0%
from disclosing those names in public
reports

04:07:20.710 --> 04:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
reports
 
04:07:23.830 --> 04:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
in assurances and discontinuances in
 
04:07:25.590 --> 04:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and in connection with
 
04:07:27.830 --> 04:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
right-to-know requests
 
04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
in the past year we had a case that
 
04:07:31.429 --> 04:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
would have been negatively impacted by
 
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:07:34.870 --> 04:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
the case involved an organization that
 
04:07:37.110 --> 04:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
purportedly was formed to support breast
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
cancer patients and their families and a
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
married couple who served as volunteer
 
04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
board members the president and the
 
04:07:43.920 --> 04:07:45.269 align:start position:0%
board members the president and the
treasurer

04:07:45.269 --> 04:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
treasurer
 
04:07:47.349 --> 04:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
after we received an anonymous tip that
 
04:07:49.349 --> 04:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
the charity was a scam and that the
 
04:07:51.110 --> 04:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
president and treasurer were using the
 
04:07:53.830 --> 04:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
funds for their own personal purposes
 
04:07:56.309 --> 04:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
we attempted to contact the charity on
 
04:08:00.149 --> 04:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
numerous occasions by telephone by mail
 
04:08:02.309 --> 04:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
by email and we issued two
 
04:08:04.229 --> 04:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
administrative subpoenas in accordance
 
04:08:04.239 --> 04:08:05.110 align:start position:0%
administrative subpoenas in accordance
with

04:08:05.110 --> 04:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:08:08.469 --> 04:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
rsa 724 but the board members failed to
 
04:08:11.110 --> 04:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
respond to any of those efforts
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
we subsequently brought a lawsuit
 
04:08:14.469 --> 04:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
against both the charity
 
04:08:15.750 --> 04:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
and the couple
 
04:08:17.429 --> 04:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
and when we did that we issued a media
 
04:08:17.439 --> 04:08:18.710 align:start position:0%
and when we did that we issued a media
release

04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
release
 
04:08:20.309 --> 04:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
the media release which named the
 
04:08:22.389 --> 04:08:22.399 align:start position:0%
president and treasurer effectively
 
04:08:25.189 --> 04:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
stopped the fundraising for the charity
 
04:08:27.670 --> 04:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
and we received from the public a number
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
of calls with information about those
 
04:08:33.189 --> 04:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
two individuals that we were able to use
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
in connection with our court case
 
04:08:37.590 --> 04:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
that information
 
04:08:37.600 --> 04:08:38.790 align:start position:0%
that information
was

04:08:38.790 --> 04:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:08:40.710 --> 04:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
provided to the court and ultimately the
 
04:08:40.720 --> 04:08:42.309 align:start position:0%
provided to the court and ultimately the
court

04:08:42.309 --> 04:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
court
 
04:08:44.070 --> 04:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
issued a judgment shutting down that
 
04:08:46.229 --> 04:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
sham charity and holding those two
 
04:08:49.910 --> 04:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
senate bill 302 would also prohibit
 
04:08:54.469 --> 04:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
public agencies from requesting the
 
04:08:56.389 --> 04:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
names of donors and for making them
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
public first our office does not
 
04:09:01.269 --> 04:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
routinely ask for the names of donors we
 
04:09:03.429 --> 04:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
don't need it and we don't ask for it
 
04:09:05.830 --> 04:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's unlike in other states but we do
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
not routinely ask for it but there are
 
04:09:10.469 --> 04:09:10.479 align:start position:0%
times when we do need the names of
 
04:09:12.389 --> 04:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
donors for example when we're trying to
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
provide restitution to donors we need
 
04:09:16.550 --> 04:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
that information
 
04:09:19.269 --> 04:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
also when we are enforcing charitable
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
gift restrictions in uh charitable
 
04:09:25.910 --> 04:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
trusts or in uh testamentary
 
04:09:28.870 --> 04:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
gifts like in in wills we need to file
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh we may have to file a petition in
 
04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
court under the terms of this bill we
 
04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
would have to file those petitions under
 
04:09:35.520 --> 04:09:37.670 align:start position:0%
would have to file those petitions under
seal

04:09:37.670 --> 04:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
seal
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
so we believe that senate bill 302
 
04:09:41.910 --> 04:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
addresses a problem that really doesn't
 
04:09:44.309 --> 04:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
exist in new hampshire and it would be
 
04:09:46.630 --> 04:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the legislature's stated
 
04:09:49.990 --> 04:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
goal in the voluntary corporation act of
 
04:09:52.149 --> 04:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
encouraging in charitable nonprofit
 
04:09:54.469 --> 04:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
corporations a quote connection with the
 
04:09:54.479 --> 04:09:55.590 align:start position:0%
corporations a quote connection with the
public

04:09:55.590 --> 04:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:09:58.630 --> 04:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
and quote public confidence
 
04:10:01.349 --> 04:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we urge the committee
 
04:10:04.149 --> 04:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
to report senate bill 302 as inexpedient
 
04:10:07.110 --> 04:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
to legislate or in the alternative to
 
04:10:09.750 --> 04:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
refer to the bill to further study i'd
 
04:10:12.550 --> 04:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions
 
04:10:12.560 --> 04:10:15.110 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions
questions

04:10:15.110 --> 04:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
represent horrigan
 
04:10:19.510 --> 04:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you can answer
 
04:10:20.710 --> 04:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
answer this but i'll ask the same
 
04:10:21.990 --> 04:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
question i answered
 
04:10:22.000 --> 04:10:23.110 align:start position:0%
question i answered
ask

04:10:23.110 --> 04:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
ask
 
04:10:25.110 --> 04:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
senator birdsall a few minutes ago which
 
04:10:26.630 --> 04:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
how would this bill impact the uh
 
04:10:32.070 --> 04:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
state government's ability to monitor
 
04:10:34.870 --> 04:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
501cs which administer state programs i
 
04:10:36.389 --> 04:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
guess i specifically
 
04:10:37.590 --> 04:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned the controversy new
 
04:10:39.269 --> 04:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
educational freedom account program but
 
04:10:40.950 --> 04:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
there's probably dozens of
 
04:10:43.510 --> 04:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
501 c 3's across the state who are
 
04:10:43.520 --> 04:10:44.790 align:start position:0%
501 c 3's across the state who are
administering

04:10:44.790 --> 04:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
administering
 
04:10:47.429 --> 04:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
other programs right so this bill
 
04:10:49.510 --> 04:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
impacts all non-profits too i just want
 
04:10:51.030 --> 04:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
to point that out and not just
 
04:10:54.790 --> 04:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
charitable nonprofits 501c3s
 
04:10:56.790 --> 04:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i can't answer that
 
04:10:58.870 --> 04:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
particular question because i'm not um
 
04:11:01.750 --> 04:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
involved from from our perspective it's
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
more difficult for us to
 
04:11:07.510 --> 04:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
monitor the um if we don't have the
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
information about board members and that
 
04:11:14.710 --> 04:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
sort of thing to um address the um
 
04:11:19.030 --> 04:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:25.910 --> 04:11:25.920 align:start position:0%

director of policy for the philanthropy
 
04:12:09.110 --> 04:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
roundtable the round table is a network
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
of charitable donors working to foster
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
excellence in philanthropy and to
 
04:12:15.429 --> 04:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
protect philanthropic freedom
 
04:12:17.910 --> 04:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 302 would help strengthen
 
04:12:19.750 --> 04:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
the vitality and the breadth of civil
 
04:12:22.229 --> 04:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
society in new hampshire it would uphold
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
a key pillar of
 
04:12:25.910 --> 04:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
philanthropic giving the right of
 
04:12:27.510 --> 04:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
charitable donors to keep their giving
 
04:12:29.110 --> 04:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
private if they wish
 
04:12:31.349 --> 04:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
throughout our nation's history the norm
 
04:12:32.950 --> 04:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
has always been that people are allowed
 
04:12:35.189 --> 04:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
to choose for themselves whether to be
 
04:12:37.269 --> 04:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
public or private in their giving and
 
04:12:39.510 --> 04:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
only in a very narrow set of
 
04:12:39.520 --> 04:12:41.189 align:start position:0%
only in a very narrow set of
circumstances

04:12:41.189 --> 04:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
04:12:42.870 --> 04:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
and such as direct contributions to
 
04:12:44.950 --> 04:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
political parties and candidates may
 
04:12:47.830 --> 04:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
this long-standing norm be set aside
 
04:12:49.750 --> 04:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
now in a time of deep division and with
 
04:12:52.149 --> 04:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
the rise of so-called cancel culture the
 
04:12:54.309 --> 04:12:54.319 align:start position:0%
choice to remain anonymous in charitable
 
04:12:56.149 --> 04:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
giving is crucial
 
04:12:58.309 --> 04:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
donors to charitable organizations may
 
04:13:00.389 --> 04:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
have concerns that they're giving to
 
04:13:03.269 --> 04:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
causes uh that are controversial now or
 
04:13:05.590 --> 04:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
may become controversial in the future
 
04:13:07.510 --> 04:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
might trigger retaliation
 
04:13:09.349 --> 04:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's because of this concern that in
 
04:13:11.910 --> 04:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
1958 the u.s supreme court ruled that
 
04:13:14.389 --> 04:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
the state of alabama could not force the
 
04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
naacp to reveal its members and donors
 
04:13:20.630 --> 04:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
because doing so would infringe on core
 
04:13:23.189 --> 04:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
first amendment rights by exposing them
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
to quote
 
04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
economic reprisal loss of employment
 
04:13:29.590 --> 04:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
threat of physical coercion and other
 
04:13:32.389 --> 04:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
manifestations of public hostility
 
04:13:34.550 --> 04:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
the right to give and associate
 
04:13:36.870 --> 04:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
privately has been upheld over and over
 
04:13:39.030 --> 04:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
by the supreme court including in last
 
04:13:41.189 --> 04:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
summer's americans for prosperity
 
04:13:42.870 --> 04:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
foundation case
 
04:13:44.229 --> 04:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
however it's not just the fear of
 
04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
harassment or retaliation that leads
 
04:13:49.030 --> 04:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
some donors to wish to remain private
 
04:13:51.670 --> 04:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
no anonymous giving to charity has
 
04:13:53.510 --> 04:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
important religious cultural and
 
04:13:55.510 --> 04:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
practical routes that extend back at
 
04:13:57.269 --> 04:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
least two millennia
 
04:13:59.510 --> 04:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
nearly two thousand years ago the roman

senator and philosopher seneca the
 
04:14:03.590 --> 04:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
younger wrote
 
04:14:05.910 --> 04:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
quote how sweet how precious is a gift
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
when he who gives does not permit
 
04:14:09.670 --> 04:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
himself to be thanked
 
04:14:11.750 --> 04:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
faith traditions including christianity
 
04:14:14.229 --> 04:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
judaism islam and hinduism throughout
 
04:14:15.990 --> 04:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
history have also strongly encouraged
 
04:14:17.910 --> 04:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
anonymous giving
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
many philanthropists prefer to give
 
04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
anonymously in order to be in order to
 
04:14:24.950 --> 04:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
avoid being inundated with unwanted
 
04:14:24.960 --> 04:14:26.950 align:start position:0%
avoid being inundated with unwanted
solicitations

04:14:26.950 --> 04:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
solicitations
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
others prefer for the attention to be
 
04:14:31.510 --> 04:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
focused on the good work of the
 
04:14:33.750 --> 04:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
charities that they support rather than
 
04:14:35.830 --> 04:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
on themselves such as the late pop
 
04:14:37.830 --> 04:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
singer george michael his generous
 
04:14:39.750 --> 04:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
support for causes including aid to
 
04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
cancer patients and helping abused
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
children was kept anonymous in large
 
04:14:45.110 --> 04:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
part for this reason
 
04:14:46.550 --> 04:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire's citizens and
 
04:14:48.790 --> 04:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
residents are no strangers to anonymous
 
04:14:48.800 --> 04:14:49.670 align:start position:0%
residents are no strangers to anonymous
giving

04:14:49.670 --> 04:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
giving
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
for example in december an anonymous
 
04:14:54.309 --> 04:14:54.319 align:start position:0%
private foundation matched donations up
 
04:14:56.630 --> 04:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
to a hundred thousand dollars for the
 
04:14:58.950 --> 04:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire food bank in what's become
 
04:15:01.510 --> 04:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
now an annual gift for the organization
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
in 2017 the food bank also received an
 
04:15:06.870 --> 04:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
anonymous 1 million donation which
 
04:15:08.630 --> 04:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
included funds for the organization's
 
04:15:11.110 --> 04:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
culinary job training program
 
04:15:13.990 --> 04:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
mobile food pantries and to reduce costs
 
04:15:18.149 --> 04:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
for the group's 430 partner agencies
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
we don't know why these givers chose to
 
04:15:21.990 --> 04:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
remain anonymous but what we do know is
 
04:15:23.590 --> 04:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
that communities throughout the state
 
04:15:25.349 --> 04:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
benefited from their unheralded
 
04:15:25.359 --> 04:15:26.950 align:start position:0%
benefited from their unheralded
generosity

04:15:26.950 --> 04:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
generosity
 
04:15:28.550 --> 04:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
now most if not all charitable
 
04:15:30.550 --> 04:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state also pledge
 
04:15:32.469 --> 04:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
to honor donor privacy
 
04:15:34.550 --> 04:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
knowing that the valuable value of
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
charitable giving is important for the
 
04:15:38.550 --> 04:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
communities that they serve
 
04:15:40.630 --> 04:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
senate bill 302 would protect the
 
04:15:42.950 --> 04:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
long-standing and vital norm of allowing
 
04:15:45.269 --> 04:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
donors to charitable organizations to
 
04:15:47.590 --> 04:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
remain private if they wish without the
 
04:15:49.830 --> 04:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
protections of this measure charitable
 
04:15:51.990 --> 04:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
organizations would be at risk in the
 
04:15:53.830 --> 04:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
future of having to violate the privacy
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
of their donors
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
in the event of forced disclosure for
 
04:16:00.309 --> 04:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
even one organization many who prefer to
 
04:16:00.319 --> 04:16:01.349 align:start position:0%
even one organization many who prefer to
remain

04:16:01.349 --> 04:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
remain
 
04:16:03.429 --> 04:16:03.439 align:start position:0%
out of the public eye for a wide variety
 
04:16:05.830 --> 04:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
of reasons would simply stop giving to a
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
wide range of groups
 
04:16:09.030 --> 04:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
limiting the important work that new
 
04:16:11.349 --> 04:16:11.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire's charities do
 
04:16:13.110 --> 04:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
so in short new hampshire must
 
04:16:15.110 --> 04:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
proactively protect those that wish to
 
04:16:17.349 --> 04:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
give to charitable organizations must
 
04:16:19.269 --> 04:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
not allow forced disclosures to chill
 
04:16:20.710 --> 04:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
giving in the state
 
04:16:23.349 --> 04:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
sb 302 would protect this norm and i
 
04:16:25.429 --> 04:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
encourage you to consider it
 
04:16:26.710 --> 04:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:16:30.070 --> 04:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
other questions representative chase
 
04:16:31.510 --> 04:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:16:33.429 --> 04:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm just curious
 
04:16:35.269 --> 04:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
because you're really focusing on the
 
04:16:37.670 --> 04:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
donors and not all of the other things
 
04:16:40.870 --> 04:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
that are in this bill if donor was
 
04:16:43.510 --> 04:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
removed and people could stay anonymous
 
04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
would that
 
04:16:45.600 --> 04:16:47.830 align:start position:0%
would that
satisfy

04:16:47.830 --> 04:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
satisfy
 
04:16:49.590 --> 04:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
you guys
 
04:16:51.189 --> 04:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
well you know what i mean thank you for
 
04:16:53.110 --> 04:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
your question i think that we do focus a
 
04:16:55.189 --> 04:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
lot on charitable givers but i think
 
04:16:57.269 --> 04:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of ways that you can be
 
04:17:00.229 --> 04:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
a donor besides financial gifts if you
 
04:17:02.790 --> 04:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
are a volunteer board member for example
 
04:17:04.550 --> 04:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
you may not wish to have a public
 
04:17:06.630 --> 04:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
association but
 
04:17:08.870 --> 04:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
as the supreme court ruled in the
 
04:17:10.790 --> 04:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
americans for prosperity foundation case
 
04:17:13.189 --> 04:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
the right to associate privately is an
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:23.189 --> 04:17:23.199 align:start position:0%

granite staters across the partisan
 
04:18:04.479 --> 04:18:05.990 align:start position:0%
granite staters across the partisan
perspective

04:18:05.990 --> 04:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
and demographic lines
 
04:18:10.149 --> 04:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
consistently support transparency in the
 
04:18:11.830 --> 04:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
democratic process
 
04:18:14.149 --> 04:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
in recognition of the critical role that
 
04:18:16.389 --> 04:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
disclosure plays on shining
 
04:18:17.349 --> 04:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
a light
 
04:18:19.189 --> 04:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
on the political influence of wealthy
 
04:18:20.630 --> 04:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
special interests
 
04:18:22.630 --> 04:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
and to hold
 
04:18:25.269 --> 04:18:25.279 align:start position:0%
elected officials accountable for and
 
04:18:26.790 --> 04:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
the public at large
 
04:18:28.550 --> 04:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
this legislation would reduce the
 
04:18:31.269 --> 04:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
accountability in our political system
 
04:18:33.349 --> 04:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
making it easier for wealthy special
 
04:18:35.349 --> 04:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
interests to make
 
04:18:37.750 --> 04:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
funding in our elections and making dark
 
04:18:40.149 --> 04:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
money in new hampshire politics a little
 
04:18:41.990 --> 04:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
bit darker
 
04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
this moves transparency in the wrong
 
04:18:46.309 --> 04:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
direction real transparency is about
 
04:18:48.630 --> 04:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
knowing who's spending big money in our
 
04:18:50.309 --> 04:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
elections and holding our government
 
04:18:50.319 --> 04:18:53.030 align:start position:0%
elections and holding our government
accountable

04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
04:18:56.309 --> 04:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
on page line one page one line thirty
 
04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
one it talks about exemptions and i
 
04:19:01.750 --> 04:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
wanna specifically talk about um on page
 
04:19:03.510 --> 04:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
two line five
 
04:19:06.790 --> 04:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
the exemption for campaign finance it is
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
narrowly defined as 664 for
 
04:19:13.750 --> 04:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
but the ag's responsibility to enforce
 
04:19:16.870 --> 04:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
campaign finance is in 666
 
04:19:18.389 --> 04:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
um also
 
04:19:20.149 --> 04:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
i just got a new book
 
04:19:22.349 --> 04:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
of the election laws it's
 
04:19:25.429 --> 04:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
419 pages and this
 
04:19:28.630 --> 04:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
is only exempting the 26 pages
 
04:19:32.070 --> 04:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
around campaign around 664 of this bill
 
04:19:33.429 --> 04:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
not all of
 
04:19:34.870 --> 04:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
the important disclosures that are
 
04:19:36.790 --> 04:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
important in election law
 
04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to speak about the
 
04:19:41.349 --> 04:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
exemption for lobbyists which is line
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
three on page two
 
04:19:46.630 --> 04:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire lobbying laws
 
04:19:49.189 --> 04:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
really are behind many other states in
 
04:19:51.030 --> 04:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
public disclosure and i think it's
 
04:19:52.469 --> 04:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
important for
 
04:19:53.990 --> 04:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
the public at large to know who's
 
04:19:56.550 --> 04:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
spending money to influence
 
04:19:59.830 --> 04:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
and i did post um a nhpr story that
 
04:20:02.070 --> 04:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
lobbying is nearly impossible to follow
 
04:20:04.710 --> 04:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
the money in new hampshire and also
 
04:20:07.429 --> 04:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
quoted former um
 
04:20:09.910 --> 04:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
attorney general gordon mcdonald
 
04:20:11.910 --> 04:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to do better with respects
 
04:20:14.389 --> 04:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
to lobbying disclosures and we need a
 
04:20:16.389 --> 04:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
standard of re review for for those
 
04:20:17.910 --> 04:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
disclosures so i think it's really
 
04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
important when you look at campaign
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
finance and lobbying how narrowly this
 
04:20:25.030 --> 04:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
is scoped those exemptions are not broad
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
exemptions it also does not exempt
 
04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
municipal campaign finance so if a
 
04:20:31.910 --> 04:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
community wants to have those donors
 
04:20:33.349 --> 04:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
disclosed on who's spending money in
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
local elections those would also not be
 
04:20:39.510 --> 04:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
under this exemption
 
04:20:41.429 --> 04:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
therefore i think it's really important
 
04:20:43.510 --> 04:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
that voters need to know who's
 
04:20:45.429 --> 04:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
influencing and spending money to
 
04:20:47.590 --> 04:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
influence our government so please
 
04:20:51.429 --> 04:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
either vote interim study or itl on this
 
04:20:53.429 --> 04:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
bill so that we can protect new
 
04:20:55.189 --> 04:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire and our important granite
 
04:20:57.269 --> 04:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
state from outside influence happy to
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
04:21:01.830 --> 04:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative smith
 
04:21:03.429 --> 04:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:21:05.189 --> 04:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you ms zinke it's always a
 
04:21:06.830 --> 04:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
pleasure to see you
 
04:21:10.710 --> 04:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
um when the prime sponsor spoke a little
 
04:21:14.149 --> 04:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
earlier i might have misheard her but i
 
04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
thought she said that this does not
 
04:21:20.830 --> 04:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
apply to electoral
 
04:21:23.590 --> 04:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
politics and yet
 
04:21:23.600 --> 04:21:24.469 align:start position:0%
politics and yet
you

04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:21:28.309 --> 04:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
are saying that it does can you help me
 
04:21:30.870 --> 04:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
understand the difference of opinion
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so page five um i mean page two
 
04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
line five
 
04:21:37.590 --> 04:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
where it talks about campaign finance it
 
04:21:39.189 --> 04:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
only um
 
04:21:42.790 --> 04:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
it only exempts rsa 664
 
04:21:45.750 --> 04:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
which is only 26 pages of the whole book
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
of campaign of of election loss
 
04:21:51.670 --> 04:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
so the piece around the ag's enforcement
 
04:21:53.510 --> 04:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
is in a different statue for campaign
 
04:21:55.590 --> 04:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
finance laws i think you want to at
 
04:21:57.269 --> 04:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
least allow the attorney general if
 
04:22:00.309 --> 04:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
they're investigating donors to to be
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know able to do that work of
 
04:22:03.990 --> 04:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
investigating donors but they're not
 
04:22:06.070 --> 04:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
under this exemption this exemption is
 
04:22:07.110 --> 04:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
only this
 
04:22:10.950 --> 04:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
sort of small part of the total loss
 
04:22:13.269 --> 04:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:16.080 --> 04:22:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
tim

04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
tim
 
04:22:18.950 --> 04:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative horrigan
 
04:22:21.910 --> 04:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr sheriff um
 
04:22:23.189 --> 04:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
so i've
 
04:22:23.199 --> 04:22:25.590 align:start position:0%
so i've
um

04:22:25.590 --> 04:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:25.600 --> 04:22:26.469 align:start position:0%
 
something

04:22:26.469 --> 04:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:22:28.229 --> 04:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
something that goes on a lot even
 
04:22:29.670 --> 04:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
something goes on a lot even the
 
04:22:32.070 --> 04:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
existing law and this doesn't apply to
 
04:22:33.590 --> 04:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
you specifically you're wearing an
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
orange badge you
 
04:22:37.030 --> 04:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
file all the
 
04:22:39.429 --> 04:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
you file complete disclosures for the
 
04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office we have a
 
04:22:43.590 --> 04:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
large number of individuals who come
 
04:22:45.269 --> 04:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
here to the state house over and over
 
04:22:47.110 --> 04:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
again who don't have the orange badges
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
aren't filing the um
 
04:22:51.670 --> 04:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
aren't filing the disclosures because
 
04:22:53.670 --> 04:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
they claim to just have advocates and
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
not lobbyists so
 
04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
um would this bill
 
04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
do anything to solve that problem or
 
04:23:03.590 --> 04:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
would it make it even worse
 
04:23:05.670 --> 04:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
i i know that there was one institute
 
04:23:08.550 --> 04:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
that rated new hampshire a d in um
 
04:23:10.630 --> 04:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
lobbying disclosures i think we rank
 
04:23:13.510 --> 04:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
pretty low uh in the threshold that's
 
04:23:16.309 --> 04:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
needed for lobbying disclosure and also
 
04:23:18.950 --> 04:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
if if we do fix rsa 15 which is the
 
04:23:21.349 --> 04:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
lobbying law to make more broad
 
04:23:23.830 --> 04:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
disclosures for lobbyists would this
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
just apply to the statute as written
 
04:23:29.030 --> 04:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
currently or or would it apply more
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
broadly if uh additional lobbying
 
04:23:34.229 --> 04:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
disclosure is ever passed and i will say
 
04:23:36.149 --> 04:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
that i have worked to try to increase
 
04:23:38.309 --> 04:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
lobbying disclosure and failed pretty
 
04:23:43.269 --> 04:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
miserably um so it's not a popular topic
 
04:23:44.710 --> 04:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:23:46.870 --> 04:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah representative wolper
 
04:23:48.229 --> 04:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question i am confused
 
04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
so rsa 664 as far as i understand it
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
which i don't have the laws in front of
 
04:23:59.429 --> 04:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
me so but as far as i understand rss
 
04:24:02.309 --> 04:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
a664 deals with the political donations
 
04:24:06.229 --> 04:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:10.070 --> 04:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
if logan and this bill talks to donors
 
04:24:11.990 --> 04:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
so isn't that the appropriate part of
 
04:24:15.830 --> 04:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:18.229 --> 04:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
i i think you're yes 66 it should
 
04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate 666 664 but should it also
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate 666 which allows the
 
04:24:26.550 --> 04:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
attorney general to investigate
 
04:24:34.389 --> 04:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:37.510 --> 04:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:43.269 --> 04:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
sing then thank you for your testimony
 
04:24:43.279 --> 04:24:44.870 align:start position:0%
sing then thank you for your testimony
today

04:24:44.870 --> 04:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:24:54.550 --> 04:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair members of
 
04:24:59.110 --> 04:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
committee my name is nathan white i'm
 
04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
from the department of health and human
 
04:25:02.790 --> 04:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
services i'm the director of contracts
 
04:25:03.990 --> 04:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
and procurement
 
04:25:05.830 --> 04:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
at health and human services and i'm
 
04:25:08.550 --> 04:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
here just to speak on one technical
 
04:25:08.560 --> 04:25:10.149 align:start position:0%
here just to speak on one technical
issue

04:25:10.149 --> 04:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:25:14.309 --> 04:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
on page one of the bill um line 23
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
there's a provision that would prohibit
 
04:25:19.510 --> 04:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
public agencies or public bodies
 
04:25:21.590 --> 04:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
from requesting or requiring a current
 
04:25:24.309 --> 04:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
or perspective contractor or grantee to
 
04:25:25.830 --> 04:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
provide a public agency or public body
 
04:25:27.510 --> 04:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
with a list of entities exempt from the
 
04:25:29.750 --> 04:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
federal income tax under section 501 c
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
the internal revenue code to which it
 
04:25:33.830 --> 04:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
has provided financial or non-financial
 
04:25:33.840 --> 04:25:35.110 align:start position:0%
has provided financial or non-financial
support

04:25:35.110 --> 04:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:25:38.309 --> 04:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
so our department on any given day has
 
04:25:41.910 --> 04:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
between 800 and 1000 active contracts
 
04:25:44.309 --> 04:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
roughly 60 to 70 percent of those
 
04:25:46.710 --> 04:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
contracts uh include
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
federal dollars every federal dollar
 
04:25:51.910 --> 04:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
that we receive that we provide in a sub
 
04:25:53.830 --> 04:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
award or we provide in a grant agreement
 
04:25:55.830 --> 04:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
or whatever it might be
 
04:25:59.110 --> 04:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
those are subject to two cfr part 200
 
04:26:00.550 --> 04:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
commonly known as federal uniform
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
guidance federal uniform guidance
 
04:26:05.189 --> 04:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
requires that we protect those funds we
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
have to follow certain procedures we
 
04:26:07.990 --> 04:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
have to conduct risk
 
04:26:09.750 --> 04:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
assessments we have to conduct
 
04:26:11.670 --> 04:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
monitoring once those dollars go out the
 
04:26:11.680 --> 04:26:12.710 align:start position:0%
monitoring once those dollars go out the
door

04:26:12.710 --> 04:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
door
 
04:26:15.269 --> 04:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
and as part of that
 
04:26:17.510 --> 04:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
we we do sometimes we act as a
 
04:26:19.990 --> 04:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
pass-through entity or we provide funds
 
04:26:22.229 --> 04:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
to a contractor and then that contractor
 
04:26:24.229 --> 04:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
or sub-recipient
 
04:26:26.710 --> 04:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
they then provide a sub-award
 
04:26:31.349 --> 04:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
it it would be challenging for us to
 
04:26:33.910 --> 04:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
to oversee and monitor
 
04:26:36.469 --> 04:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
those funds if we were unable to ask our
 
04:26:38.630 --> 04:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
immediate contractor who did they
 
04:26:41.030 --> 04:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
provide several words to so the domestic
 
04:26:42.710 --> 04:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
coalition for domestic and sexual
 
04:26:44.790 --> 04:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
violence we commonly you know we will
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
give them
 
04:26:48.550 --> 04:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
x amount of dollars for x purpose and
 
04:26:50.469 --> 04:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
then they will provide those to 12
 
04:26:52.710 --> 04:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
member organizations or crisis centers
 
04:26:55.030 --> 04:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
um that that's just an example so this
 
04:26:57.510 --> 04:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
particular provision um would be
 
04:26:59.830 --> 04:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
challenging for us to still comply with
 
04:27:01.189 --> 04:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
the federal requirements that we're
 
04:27:02.469 --> 04:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
04:27:04.630 --> 04:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
another more technical aspect and i
 
04:27:06.229 --> 04:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
apologize for being the one here
 
04:27:07.990 --> 04:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
bringing the the technical nuance
 
04:27:09.429 --> 04:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
aspects that are relatively boring
 
04:27:09.439 --> 04:27:10.389 align:start position:0%
aspects that are relatively boring
honestly

04:27:10.389 --> 04:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
honestly
 
04:27:13.750 --> 04:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
but another key provision here though is
 
04:27:15.990 --> 04:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh our standard uh state terms and
 
04:27:19.269 --> 04:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
conditions um p37 that requires every
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
state agency this isn't just dhhs this
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
is any agency whether it's general funds
 
04:27:26.229 --> 04:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
federal funds or other funds
 
04:27:26.239 --> 04:27:26.950 align:start position:0%
federal funds or other funds
to

04:27:26.950 --> 04:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:27:29.110 --> 04:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
review and approve
 
04:27:31.990 --> 04:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
any subcontracts that a contractor that
 
04:27:34.229 --> 04:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
we provide funding to may have so that's
 
04:27:36.070 --> 04:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
just another potential issue that i just
 
04:27:40.389 --> 04:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.950 --> 04:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:46.309 --> 04:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
sing them thank you for your testimony

of senate bill 302
 
04:28:11.189 --> 04:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
i actually come here wearing several
 
04:28:12.870 --> 04:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
hats i am the state director for
 
04:28:14.309 --> 04:28:14.319 align:start position:0%

director for americans for prosperity
 
04:28:18.790 --> 04:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
foundation and someone who sits and has
 
04:28:21.189 --> 04:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
sat on several
 
04:28:23.189 --> 04:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
non-profit boards as i'm sure a lot of
 
04:28:25.189 --> 04:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
the other members of the committee have
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
of local new hampshire non-profits so i
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
come at it from a number of different
 
04:28:29.040 --> 04:28:30.389 align:start position:0%
come at it from a number of different
perspectives

04:28:30.389 --> 04:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
perspectives
 
04:28:30.399 --> 04:28:31.590 align:start position:0%
perspectives
uh

04:28:31.590 --> 04:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:33.349 --> 04:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
i think talking a little bit
 
04:28:35.189 --> 04:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
about the history
 
04:28:37.750 --> 04:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
of this issue is important to understand
 
04:28:39.110 --> 04:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
sort of the rationale for the
 
04:28:39.120 --> 04:28:40.550 align:start position:0%
sort of the rationale for the
legislation

04:28:40.550 --> 04:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:28:42.389 --> 04:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh and i'll just want to i'll just say
 
04:28:43.830 --> 04:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
that that we were not involved in the
 
04:28:45.349 --> 04:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
development or construction of this law
 
04:28:47.429 --> 04:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
but when you're the name plaintiff in
 
04:28:49.269 --> 04:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
the most recent supreme court case it
 
04:28:50.790 --> 04:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
kind of pulls you into an issue like
 
04:28:50.800 --> 04:28:52.710 align:start position:0%
kind of pulls you into an issue like
this

04:28:52.710 --> 04:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:28:52.720 --> 04:28:53.830 align:start position:0%
this
so

04:28:53.830 --> 04:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:53.840 --> 04:28:54.550 align:start position:0%
so
the

04:28:54.550 --> 04:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:56.790 --> 04:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
donor protections exist from the mid 50s
 
04:28:58.870 --> 04:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
this was in the beginnings of the civil
 
04:29:00.550 --> 04:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
rights movement the
 
04:29:03.269 --> 04:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
attorney general of of alabama
 
04:29:03.279 --> 04:29:04.630 align:start position:0%
attorney general of of alabama
requested

04:29:04.630 --> 04:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
requested
 
04:29:04.640 --> 04:29:05.510 align:start position:0%
requested
the

04:29:05.510 --> 04:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:29:09.110 --> 04:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
donor records from the naacp
 
04:29:11.030 --> 04:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
now i'm sure you can imagine why the
 
04:29:13.349 --> 04:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
naacp would be fairly hesitant to hand
 
04:29:14.710 --> 04:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
those overs and the chilling effect it
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
would have on future
 
04:29:19.590 --> 04:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
future uh contributions importantly for
 
04:29:21.429 --> 04:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
them but also for the for their donors
 
04:29:23.269 --> 04:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
the impact that that would have on them
 
04:29:25.030 --> 04:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
and of course the supreme court ruled
 
04:29:26.550 --> 04:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
that this is protected under the first
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
amendment under the free association
 
04:29:28.319 --> 04:29:29.429 align:start position:0%
amendment under the free association
clause

04:29:29.429 --> 04:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
clause
 
04:29:31.349 --> 04:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
americans for prosperity foundation was
 
04:29:35.830 --> 04:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
surprised in 2015
 
04:29:37.590 --> 04:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
when the california department of
 
04:29:37.600 --> 04:29:39.030 align:start position:0%
when the california department of
justice

04:29:39.030 --> 04:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
justice
 
04:29:41.590 --> 04:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
demanded our donor records
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
we obviously brought litigation and and
 
04:29:46.950 --> 04:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
what went on for
 
04:29:48.950 --> 04:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
six years before there was an ultimate
 
04:29:50.710 --> 04:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
resolution last year in the us supreme
 
04:29:53.189 --> 04:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
court which again reaffirmed the right
 
04:29:55.349 --> 04:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
to to the privacy of donors and i
 
04:29:57.990 --> 04:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
actually have a list of there were 300
 
04:30:00.630 --> 04:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
different groups that uh joined in uh
 
04:30:02.070 --> 04:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
miki briefs
 
04:30:03.990 --> 04:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
on that particular legislation and it's
 
04:30:05.910 --> 04:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
as diverse as from the aclu to the human
 
04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
rights campaign to the gun owners of
 
04:30:10.550 --> 04:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
america to the reason foundation so it's
 
04:30:12.389 --> 04:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
literally all over the map including
 
04:30:15.269 --> 04:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
humane societies uh private universities
 
04:30:17.189 --> 04:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
etc i'm happy to to give that out to the
 
04:30:17.199 --> 04:30:27.349 align:start position:0%
etc i'm happy to to give that out to the
committee

04:30:27.349 --> 04:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
now now i want to point out this is not
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
about us um
 
04:30:33.429 --> 04:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
i can't imagine any attorney general or
 
04:30:34.790 --> 04:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
any department of justice in new
 
04:30:36.389 --> 04:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire in the right mind would
 
04:30:38.070 --> 04:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
go after us away california did
 
04:30:39.429 --> 04:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
considering we had the resources and
 
04:30:41.590 --> 04:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
gumption to take them all the way to the
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
us supreme court
 
04:30:45.030 --> 04:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
of course
 
04:30:46.710 --> 04:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
if you were a smaller non-profit and the
 
04:30:48.469 --> 04:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
idea of a twenty thousand dollar or
 
04:30:51.590 --> 04:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollar legal bill came up
 
04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
that that could have devastating impacts
 
04:30:56.550 --> 04:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
to your small non-profit so
 
04:30:58.229 --> 04:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
this this uh
 
04:30:59.670 --> 04:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
this legislation would simply make sure
 
04:31:01.990 --> 04:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
that that that would never happen and no
 
04:31:03.269 --> 04:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:31:04.870 --> 04:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
charity would would end up going through
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
what we go through or what we went
 
04:31:08.630 --> 04:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
through for six years so that's what we
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
want to forestall here and i know that i
 
04:31:12.309 --> 04:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
know the philanthropy roundtable is
 
04:31:14.950 --> 04:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
doing these efforts uh nationally
 
04:31:17.429 --> 04:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important work
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:24.790 --> 04:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
we mentioned rsa664 i will say i will
 
04:31:28.710 --> 04:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
say that in new hampshire under 664
 
04:31:30.309 --> 04:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
if you are engaged in any election
 
04:31:31.670 --> 04:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
hearing you have to file a political
 
04:31:32.950 --> 04:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
committee whether you're a non-profit or
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
any other entity
 
04:31:37.349 --> 04:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
we americans for prosperity files as a
 
04:31:38.790 --> 04:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
political committee
 
04:31:40.950 --> 04:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
and any other any other nonprofit has to
 
04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
that would not change
 
04:31:45.510 --> 04:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
at all under this under this legislation
 
04:31:47.990 --> 04:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
they would still have to file file with
 
04:31:50.870 --> 04:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
with the secretary of state's office
 
04:31:52.630 --> 04:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
one last one last point i'd like to make
 
04:31:55.030 --> 04:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
to the committee is is just as i said
 
04:31:56.950 --> 04:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
the impact that this this would have on
 
04:31:58.389 --> 04:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
think about the local smaller
 
04:32:00.149 --> 04:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
non-profits they don't have the
 
04:32:03.429 --> 04:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
resources to go and and
 
04:32:05.349 --> 04:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
go to court and protect their
 
04:32:07.510 --> 04:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights so i think it's
 
04:32:09.189 --> 04:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand
 
04:32:11.110 --> 04:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
putting that hat on from my perspective
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
of how if we had got a demand letter
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
from the department of justice
 
04:32:17.750 --> 04:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
how we would handle that obviously we'd
 
04:32:19.269 --> 04:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
have to go find legal counsel and pay
 
04:32:21.269 --> 04:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
them and and
 
04:32:23.269 --> 04:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
again the idea of a substantial legal
 
04:32:25.269 --> 04:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
bill could have a major impact on on a
 
04:32:27.030 --> 04:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
small non-profit here in new hampshire
 
04:32:28.149 --> 04:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
ultimately they probably would just
 
04:32:29.429 --> 04:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
comply in other words just give away
 
04:32:30.550 --> 04:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
their constitutional rights because they
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't have the the resources to defend
 
04:32:34.149 --> 04:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
themselves and that to me is
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
particularly concerning so with that uh
 
04:32:38.950 --> 04:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
i'll in my testimony be happy to take
 
04:32:41.670 --> 04:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
04:32:45.030 --> 04:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:45.040 --> 04:32:46.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:32:46.830 --> 04:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:32:48.870 --> 04:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative you mr chair and thank
 
04:32:51.030 --> 04:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question i'm i'm not
 
04:32:54.389 --> 04:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
familiar with the case uh now the naacp
 
04:32:56.790 --> 04:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
the 1958 case that we've heard
 
04:32:58.950 --> 04:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
referenced or actually with the case in
 
04:33:00.710 --> 04:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
california but
 
04:33:03.590 --> 04:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
in 1958 in the w
 
04:33:03.600 --> 04:33:05.109 align:start position:0%
in 1958 in the w
um

04:33:05.109 --> 04:33:05.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:07.590 --> 04:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
cp i i mean my gut
 
04:33:10.390 --> 04:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
response i mean thought you said is that
 
04:33:11.830 --> 04:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to reveal their donors
 
04:33:12.789 --> 04:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
because they probably thought they would
 
04:33:15.109 --> 04:33:15.119 align:start position:0%
be killed they weren't chilling effect
 
04:33:16.949 --> 04:33:16.959 align:start position:0%
on donors so
 
04:33:18.869 --> 04:33:18.879 align:start position:0%
you had said that they didn't want to
 
04:33:19.990 --> 04:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
give it out for the chili effect on
 
04:33:21.750 --> 04:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
donors i'm just wondering with your
 
04:33:24.150 --> 04:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
familiarity is that the reason
 
04:33:27.349 --> 04:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
i well i i i'm 100 convinced that that's
 
04:33:29.670 --> 04:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
true that you're right that that the the
 
04:33:31.429 --> 04:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
health and safety of their donors would
 
04:33:34.150 --> 04:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
be a top priority as well but beyond
 
04:33:36.070 --> 04:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
that there would be a chilling effect
 
04:33:39.029 --> 04:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
for future donors uh i i'll tell you i
 
04:33:42.070 --> 04:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
in the process of doing fundraising
 
04:33:44.629 --> 04:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
um have to admit when you work for a
 
04:33:46.789 --> 04:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
politically active nonprofit
 
04:33:49.109 --> 04:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of your donors ask if their
 
04:33:50.629 --> 04:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
contribution will be kept private it's
 
04:33:50.639 --> 04:33:51.750 align:start position:0%
contribution will be kept private it's
because

04:33:51.750 --> 04:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:33:53.670 --> 04:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
while they might believe in that they
 
04:33:55.590 --> 04:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
don't want their name associated because
 
04:33:57.029 --> 04:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
they might be in business doing
 
04:33:57.990 --> 04:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
something else that would have a
 
04:34:00.230 --> 04:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
negative impact and frankly the top
 
04:34:02.150 --> 04:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
reason i think is that they're afraid of
 
04:34:03.910 --> 04:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
further unwanted contributions in other
 
04:34:05.670 --> 04:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
words if you show up on a list as a
 
04:34:08.070 --> 04:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
donor to one organization there'll be a
 
04:34:09.750 --> 04:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
conga line of fundraisers from every
 
04:34:11.670 --> 04:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
other organization that will line right
 
04:34:14.070 --> 04:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
up and and uh
 
04:34:16.949 --> 04:34:16.959 align:start position:0%
starts listing you as well and and uh if
 
04:34:18.789 --> 04:34:18.799 align:start position:0%
you've ever hung out with some larger
 
04:34:20.310 --> 04:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
donors who are known to give
 
04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
contributions uh
 
04:34:24.310 --> 04:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
donor fatigue isn't just isn't just
 
04:34:25.750 --> 04:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
being tired of giving money sometimes
 
04:34:28.789 --> 04:34:28.799 align:start position:0%
it's just tired of being asked for money
 
04:34:31.590 --> 04:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
i hope that's helpful
 
04:34:35.510 --> 04:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:37.269 --> 04:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr kieran thank you mr moore
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions i noticed that
 
04:34:42.470 --> 04:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
you um sent around a handout but there
 
04:34:44.709 --> 04:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
are no citations no references i mean
 
04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
what is this
 
04:34:46.160 --> 04:34:47.269 align:start position:0%
what is this
so

04:34:47.269 --> 04:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:50.150 --> 04:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh that is a list of the organizations
 
04:34:52.390 --> 04:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
that filed the miki briefs before the
 
04:34:55.269 --> 04:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
supreme court uh the decision uh the
 
04:34:57.510 --> 04:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
case was uh americans for prosperity
 
04:34:59.830 --> 04:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
foundation versus bonta
 
04:35:01.830 --> 04:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
and bonta is the attorney general for
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:07.990 --> 04:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
a follow-up place and what was the date
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:35:11.590 --> 04:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
so the the case itself was argued uh
 
04:35:13.590 --> 04:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
early in the 21 uh
 
04:35:16.070 --> 04:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh states uh use sorry
 
04:35:18.150 --> 04:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
supreme court season and it came out in
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
june of 2021.
 
04:35:22.949 --> 04:35:22.959 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:35:25.109 --> 04:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:35:27.510 --> 04:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative simpson
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:35:31.429 --> 04:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
my question mr moore
 
04:35:31.439 --> 04:35:33.189 align:start position:0%
my question mr moore
um

04:35:33.189 --> 04:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:35.910 --> 04:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
this that you just handed to us so i'm i
 
04:35:38.070 --> 04:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
guess i'm thinking through
 
04:35:39.910 --> 04:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
the difference between keeping board
 
04:35:42.390 --> 04:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
members names private and keeping donors
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
names private
 
04:35:47.109 --> 04:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering um this list
 
04:35:47.119 --> 04:35:47.990 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering um this list
about

04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:35:50.230 --> 04:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
your case in california was that
 
04:35:52.230 --> 04:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
specifically about donors or was that
 
04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
also about
 
04:35:56.390 --> 04:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
board members so that so the initial
 
04:35:59.109 --> 04:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
demand on the part of the california
 
04:36:01.750 --> 04:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
department of justice was for donors it
 
04:36:03.510 --> 04:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
did not involved
 
04:36:03.520 --> 04:36:04.390 align:start position:0%
did not involved
as

04:36:04.390 --> 04:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:36:04.400 --> 04:36:05.269 align:start position:0%
as
um

04:36:05.269 --> 04:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
so the
 
04:36:09.830 --> 04:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
americans prosperity foundation is a
 
04:36:11.910 --> 04:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
corporation that's uh based in in
 
04:36:13.429 --> 04:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
delaware so it's a delaware-based
 
04:36:15.670 --> 04:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
corporation so it would follow delaware
 
04:36:16.949 --> 04:36:16.959 align:start position:0%
law as far as reporting and then
 
04:36:18.629 --> 04:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
obviously it would be considered a
 
04:36:21.029 --> 04:36:21.039 align:start position:0%
foreign corporation in the other states
 
04:36:23.510 --> 04:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
in which it it operates but to your to
 
04:36:25.269 --> 04:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
your question it was just the demand was
 
04:36:28.390 --> 04:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
just for donors okay great thank you
 
04:36:31.429 --> 04:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
and then um oh sorry can i follow up
 
04:36:32.390 --> 04:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:36:35.109 --> 04:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking about donors to nonprofits
 
04:36:36.390 --> 04:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
and how
 
04:36:38.949 --> 04:36:38.959 align:start position:0%
like the ag's responsibility to protect
 
04:36:40.789 --> 04:36:40.799 align:start position:0%
the public and my
 
04:36:43.109 --> 04:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
my thinking is that a lot of donors want
 
04:36:45.029 --> 04:36:45.039 align:start position:0%
transparency about who's making
 
04:36:47.189 --> 04:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
decisions about the budget and about
 
04:36:49.269 --> 04:36:49.279 align:start position:0%
where the money that they're giving is
 
04:36:49.279 --> 04:36:50.230 align:start position:0%
where the money that they're giving is
going

04:36:50.230 --> 04:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
going
 
04:36:52.150 --> 04:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering in the course of this
 
04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
like how you how you would talk about
 
04:36:58.070 --> 04:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
balancing those those interests
 
04:36:59.590 --> 04:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
again that's a great question because i
 
04:37:00.869 --> 04:37:00.879 align:start position:0%
come at it from a number of different
 
04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
angles um i will say i will say that
 
04:37:07.349 --> 04:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
that in in my donor meetings for raising
 
04:37:08.629 --> 04:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
money for americans for prosperity
 
04:37:11.029 --> 04:37:11.039 align:start position:0%
america's prosperity foundation i get
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
asked a lot of questions and we go
 
04:37:14.230 --> 04:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
through the entire process with our
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
prospective donors
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's obviously for for larger donors
 
04:37:19.590 --> 04:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
and not so much for the person you're
 
04:37:22.230 --> 04:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
doing a male solicitation for 25 is
 
04:37:23.670 --> 04:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
obviously a little bit different
 
04:37:25.349 --> 04:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
standard but if you're asking someone
 
04:37:27.029 --> 04:37:27.039 align:start position:0%
for a six-figure gift you're going to
 
04:37:29.429 --> 04:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
get asked a lot of questions um some of
 
04:37:30.629 --> 04:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
those presentations literally will be
 
04:37:32.390 --> 04:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
like four or five hours
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
and and i will say i will say that that
 
04:37:35.520 --> 04:37:36.470 align:start position:0%
and and i will say i will say that that
um

04:37:36.470 --> 04:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:39.349 --> 04:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
donors ask those questions and and
 
04:37:42.070 --> 04:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
at the first instance
 
04:37:43.910 --> 04:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's might be something that the
 
04:37:45.910 --> 04:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
donor's a little short
 
04:37:47.590 --> 04:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
as far as asking those questions saying
 
04:37:49.590 --> 04:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
that saying that you need to have the
 
04:37:51.189 --> 04:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
department of justice
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
oversee that i understand the department
 
04:37:54.709 --> 04:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
of justice
 
04:37:56.629 --> 04:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
perception i've certainly
 
04:37:56.639 --> 04:37:57.670 align:start position:0%
perception i've certainly
i've

04:37:57.670 --> 04:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
i've
 
04:37:59.510 --> 04:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
i certainly get the fact why they would
 
04:38:02.629 --> 04:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
like to have access to more information
 
04:38:04.390 --> 04:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
but again having that access to
 
04:38:06.390 --> 04:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
information how that information can be
 
04:38:06.400 --> 04:38:07.830 align:start position:0%
information how that information can be
used

04:38:07.830 --> 04:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
used
 
04:38:09.349 --> 04:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
it could potentially show up somewhere
 
04:38:11.910 --> 04:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
else if it were if that information came
 
04:38:13.830 --> 04:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
to the department of justice it could be
 
04:38:16.390 --> 04:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
subject perhaps to a 91 a request
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
and then suddenly all that becomes
 
04:38:20.709 --> 04:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
public via that that route so i mean
 
04:38:22.709 --> 04:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
there are ways of once that information
 
04:38:24.470 --> 04:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
is transferred
 
04:38:26.230 --> 04:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
for it to become public in a way that
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
could be damaging to the individuals
 
04:38:27.600 --> 04:38:31.830 align:start position:0%
could be damaging to the individuals
involved

04:38:31.830 --> 04:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
can i thank you
 
04:38:35.189 --> 04:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to
 
04:38:37.109 --> 04:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
think through now like one more step
 
04:38:39.029 --> 04:38:39.039 align:start position:0%
which is like
 
04:38:41.510 --> 04:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
so all the 501cs
 
04:38:41.520 --> 04:38:43.029 align:start position:0%
so all the 501cs
are

04:38:43.029 --> 04:38:43.039 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:38:45.269 --> 04:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
exempt from taxation
 
04:38:47.429 --> 04:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
on this money
 
04:38:50.310 --> 04:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me that the 501cs then
 
04:38:52.230 --> 04:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility
 
04:38:53.990 --> 04:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
like a greater responsibility to the
 
04:38:54.000 --> 04:38:55.269 align:start position:0%
like a greater responsibility to the
public

04:38:55.269 --> 04:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:38:58.390 --> 04:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
to show what public good they're doing
 
04:38:59.750 --> 04:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
and how
 
04:38:59.760 --> 04:39:01.670 align:start position:0%
and how
then

04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:39:03.670 --> 04:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'm just
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm trying to say is like
 
04:39:07.269 --> 04:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
what is what's again like what's the
 
04:39:07.279 --> 04:39:08.551 align:start position:0%
what is what's again like what's the
balance

04:39:08.551 --> 04:39:08.561 align:start position:0%
balance
 
04:39:11.429 --> 04:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
i do and and of course there are a ton
 
04:39:11.439 --> 04:39:12.869 align:start position:0%
i do and and of course there are a ton
of

04:39:12.869 --> 04:39:12.879 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:39:14.869 --> 04:39:14.879 align:start position:0%
non-charitable non-profits that do
 
04:39:16.949 --> 04:39:16.959 align:start position:0%
incredible work uh
 
04:39:16.959 --> 04:39:18.310 align:start position:0%
incredible work uh
and

04:39:18.310 --> 04:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's also important to understand it and
 
04:39:21.269 --> 04:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
i understand this from department of
 
04:39:22.789 --> 04:39:22.799 align:start position:0%
justice standpoint
 
04:39:25.269 --> 04:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
of there are scam non-profits right
 
04:39:27.189 --> 04:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
there are groups out there that just
 
04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
basically set up a shell and put
 
04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
together a couple nice glossies flyers
 
04:39:33.510 --> 04:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe they have a really charismatic
 
04:39:33.520 --> 04:39:34.949 align:start position:0%
and maybe they have a really charismatic
person

04:39:34.949 --> 04:39:34.959 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:39:34.959 --> 04:39:36.070 align:start position:0%
person
and

04:39:36.070 --> 04:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:39:39.030 --> 04:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh at the at the first instance uh at
 
04:39:40.390 --> 04:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
the first instance though i would say
 
04:39:41.910 --> 04:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
that that it's
 
04:39:43.590 --> 04:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
the responsibility
 
04:39:45.830 --> 04:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
of the donor to be able to to work
 
04:39:48.948 --> 04:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
through that i mean i i i
 
04:39:51.270 --> 04:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
large donors ask so many questions they
 
04:39:53.670 --> 04:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
do and um i think it's probably because
 
04:39:55.110 --> 04:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
they have been solicited by some of
 
04:39:58.628 --> 04:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
these potential scam non-profits
 
04:39:59.910 --> 04:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
the risk of subjecting all the good
 
04:40:02.400 --> 04:40:03.910 align:start position:0%
the risk of subjecting all the good
non-profits

04:40:03.910 --> 04:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
non-profits
 
04:40:03.920 --> 04:40:05.190 align:start position:0%
non-profits
uh

04:40:05.190 --> 04:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:40:05.200 --> 04:40:06.070 align:start position:0%
uh
to

04:40:06.070 --> 04:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:40:08.708 --> 04:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
potential potential harm
 
04:40:10.230 --> 04:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
you know that obviously you're the
 
04:40:11.910 --> 04:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
legislature you make that public policy
 
04:40:14.708 --> 04:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
decision uh but i would say i would say
 
04:40:17.110 --> 04:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
that the the protection offered to the
 
04:40:18.868 --> 04:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
non-profits doing great work every day
 
04:40:24.070 --> 04:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:26.788 --> 04:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
04:40:28.868 --> 04:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair good afternoon miss
 
04:40:28.878 --> 04:40:30.868 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair good afternoon miss
moore

04:40:30.868 --> 04:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
moore
 
04:40:33.350 --> 04:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
you just did something that
 
04:40:37.110 --> 04:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
made my mind take a leap
 
04:40:39.670 --> 04:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
to frm
 
04:40:41.590 --> 04:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
in which
 
04:40:41.600 --> 04:40:42.948 align:start position:0%
in which
ultimately

04:40:42.948 --> 04:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
04:40:46.310 --> 04:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
the state was held
 
04:40:46.320 --> 04:40:50.788 align:start position:0%
the state was held
responsible

04:40:50.788 --> 04:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:54.310 --> 04:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
because it did not catch the fact
 
04:40:56.830 --> 04:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
that there was some
 
04:41:01.830 --> 04:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:01.840 --> 04:41:03.430 align:start position:0%
 
my

04:41:03.430 --> 04:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:41:06.708 --> 04:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
mind connected the two because if the
 
04:41:10.470 --> 04:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
state is responsible for
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
verifying eligibility
 
04:41:14.628 --> 04:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
under um
 
04:41:14.638 --> 04:41:16.390 align:start position:0%
under um
501

04:41:16.390 --> 04:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
501
 
04:41:16.400 --> 04:41:17.510 align:start position:0%
501
c

04:41:17.510 --> 04:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
c
 
04:41:17.520 --> 04:41:18.390 align:start position:0%
c
for

04:41:18.390 --> 04:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:41:20.470 --> 04:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
getting reports
 
04:41:24.070 --> 04:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
if in fact there is an organization that
 
04:41:31.030 --> 04:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
is not using
 
04:41:32.948 --> 04:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
donated money in a way that is
 
04:41:32.958 --> 04:41:35.510 align:start position:0%
donated money in a way that is
appropriate

04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:41:38.788 --> 04:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
and if the state has no way of
 
04:41:41.350 --> 04:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
knowing that
 
04:41:43.590 --> 04:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
nonetheless wouldn't the state
 
04:41:47.030 --> 04:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
be responsible as it was
 
04:41:50.948 --> 04:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
uh determined in the frm case
 
04:41:52.230 --> 04:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
you raise a great great point
 
04:41:54.550 --> 04:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative i think i think that
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
potentially by injecting the state into
 
04:41:56.560 --> 04:41:57.350 align:start position:0%
potentially by injecting the state into
this

04:41:57.350 --> 04:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:41:59.670 --> 04:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
you're there is a liability risk for the
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
state that they that they're taking on
 
04:42:03.670 --> 04:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
as we now see as the
 
04:42:05.430 --> 04:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
past budget showed
 
04:42:07.110 --> 04:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
um where
 
04:42:08.868 --> 04:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
the the settlement funds are right there
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
some settlement funds are in the budget
 
04:42:13.830 --> 04:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
i i would also say this uh it's
 
04:42:14.948 --> 04:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
important to understand that the
 
04:42:17.350 --> 04:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
nonprofit world
 
04:42:19.830 --> 04:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't operate in a vacuum
 
04:42:23.190 --> 04:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
there are a number of organizations
 
04:42:25.670 --> 04:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
that review non-profits
 
04:42:25.680 --> 04:42:26.628 align:start position:0%
that review non-profits
uh

04:42:26.628 --> 04:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:28.070 --> 04:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
guidestar and
 
04:42:30.390 --> 04:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
other organizations that actually go and
 
04:42:31.590 --> 04:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
they review it
 
04:42:31.600 --> 04:42:32.310 align:start position:0%
they review it
and

04:42:32.310 --> 04:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:35.190 --> 04:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
if they find for example that that a uh
 
04:42:37.750 --> 04:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
that a non-profit is giving away a
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
relatively small amount of the other
 
04:42:40.868 --> 04:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
funds that they raise and i've seen
 
04:42:43.190 --> 04:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
non-profits that
 
04:42:44.948 --> 04:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
they give away like 10 or 15 percent of
 
04:42:46.310 --> 04:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
the funds that they raise and the rest
 
04:42:49.590 --> 04:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
all goes to overhead and organization
 
04:42:51.670 --> 04:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
they get downgraded and when those
 
04:42:54.550 --> 04:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
organizations like guidestar downgrade
 
04:42:56.788 --> 04:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
a non-profit it becomes a lot harder for
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
them to raise money inappropriately so i
 
04:42:59.830 --> 04:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
know that's not quite appropriate it
 
04:43:02.070 --> 04:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
just came to my head
 
04:43:03.670 --> 04:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
so i thought but i wanted to add that
 
04:43:05.190 --> 04:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
but i think you you raise a great point
 
04:43:05.200 --> 04:43:07.910 align:start position:0%
but i think you you raise a great point
representative

04:43:07.910 --> 04:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:11.110 --> 04:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:12.550 --> 04:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
sing none thank you for your testimony
 
04:43:14.550 --> 04:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you

mr chairman members of the committee
 
04:43:31.750 --> 04:43:31.760 align:start position:0%

committee several times about housing
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
issues i'm here today with a different
 
04:43:39.910 --> 04:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
hat on i'm here as a public policy
 
04:43:41.910 --> 04:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
consultant with the new hampshire center
 
04:43:45.190 --> 04:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
for non-profits our ceo kathleen verdin
 
04:43:46.788 --> 04:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here today so i'll be
 
04:43:49.350 --> 04:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
providing her testimony
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire center for nonprofits
 
04:43:54.628 --> 04:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
is opposed to senate bill 302
 
04:43:56.788 --> 04:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
um the center is our umbrella
 
04:43:58.788 --> 04:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
organization in the state we have 700
 
04:43:58.798 --> 04:44:00.310 align:start position:0%
organization in the state we have 700
members

04:44:00.310 --> 04:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:44:02.708 --> 04:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
the entity is dedicated to strengthening
 
04:44:05.190 --> 04:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
and giving voice to the nonprofit sector
 
04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
through leadership collaboration and
 
04:44:09.910 --> 04:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
learning opportunities
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
overall we oppose this legislation
 
04:44:14.230 --> 04:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
because we believe there are a number of
 
04:44:15.990 --> 04:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences to these
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
proposals as has been mentioned this is
 
04:44:19.200 --> 04:44:20.390 align:start position:0%
proposals as has been mentioned this is
um

04:44:20.390 --> 04:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:22.230 --> 04:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
the the source of this proposal is
 
04:44:25.030 --> 04:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
really a national effort around donor
 
04:44:27.190 --> 04:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
privacy we really think that this
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
proposal is in search of a problem that
 
04:44:31.350 --> 04:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
does not exist in the granite state so
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
i'm going to talk a little bit about
 
04:44:34.868 --> 04:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
that first i want to raise an issue
 
04:44:36.788 --> 04:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
around the role that was mentioned
 
04:44:38.628 --> 04:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
earlier about preserving the public
 
04:44:38.638 --> 04:44:39.750 align:start position:0%
earlier about preserving the public
trust

04:44:39.750 --> 04:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
trust
 
04:44:41.590 --> 04:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years of pandemic
 
04:44:43.350 --> 04:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
related challenges i think it's clear to
 
04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
all of us about the important role that
 
04:44:49.190 --> 04:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:51.990 --> 04:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
our sector in the state often plays the
 
04:44:53.430 --> 04:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
role that government would play in
 
04:44:55.270 --> 04:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
another state
 
04:44:57.110 --> 04:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
it is really important that our
 
04:44:59.750 --> 04:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
nonprofit sector in new hampshire know
 
04:45:02.550 --> 04:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
how to effectively manage finances
 
04:45:05.430 --> 04:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
engage in transparency around governance
 
04:45:07.750 --> 04:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
avoid self-dealing and remain
 
04:45:07.760 --> 04:45:08.830 align:start position:0%
avoid self-dealing and remain
politically

04:45:08.830 --> 04:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
politically
 
04:45:11.430 --> 04:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan the new layer of proposed
 
04:45:13.990 --> 04:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
restraints on public agencies and right
 
04:45:16.230 --> 04:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
to know public bodies regarding
 
04:45:18.070 --> 04:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
regarding the records of non-profits
 
04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
could erode our public trust here in the
 
04:45:22.628 --> 04:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
granite state of course we do value our
 
04:45:22.638 --> 04:45:23.590 align:start position:0%
granite state of course we do value our
rights

04:45:23.590 --> 04:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
rights
 
04:45:25.430 --> 04:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
of privacy and we talk a lot about
 
04:45:27.590 --> 04:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
privacy in the boardroom
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
but we think here we have appropriate
 
04:45:30.240 --> 04:45:31.670 align:start position:0%
but we think here we have appropriate
transparency

04:45:31.670 --> 04:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
04:45:34.150 --> 04:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
that ultimately make
 
04:45:37.270 --> 04:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
create a a
 
04:45:39.350 --> 04:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
an agreement between our donors our
 
04:45:42.628 --> 04:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
volunteers and our leaders uh and uh and
 
04:45:44.708 --> 04:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit sector and help us being
 
04:45:46.708 --> 04:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
more successful at executing on our
 
04:45:46.718 --> 04:45:47.910 align:start position:0%
more successful at executing on our
missions

04:45:47.910 --> 04:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
missions
 
04:45:47.920 --> 04:45:48.868 align:start position:0%
missions
another

04:45:48.868 --> 04:45:48.878 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:45:50.868 --> 04:45:50.878 align:start position:0%

04:45:50.878 --> 04:45:52.708 align:start position:0%
likely adverse consequence to additional
confidentiality

04:45:52.708 --> 04:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
04:45:54.310 --> 04:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
is what anything would happen when you
 
04:45:56.390 --> 04:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
have like just a lack of transparency a
 
04:45:58.628 --> 04:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
lack of sunshine in these highly
 
04:46:01.510 --> 04:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
divisive times there are few societal
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
spaces now that are nonpartisan
 
04:46:07.350 --> 04:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
we at the center encourage advocacy um
 
04:46:08.708 --> 04:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
and we honor
 
04:46:10.788 --> 04:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
but we do think it's important that c3s
 
04:46:12.150 --> 04:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
remember that they can't endorse
 
04:46:14.628 --> 04:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
candidates nor give money for public
 
04:46:16.948 --> 04:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
office but there is a growing amount of
 
04:46:19.270 --> 04:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
pressure to move money through the c3
 
04:46:21.350 --> 04:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
sector and something that we're we're
 
04:46:23.510 --> 04:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
watching and concerned with um and in
 
04:46:25.990 --> 04:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
the last um administration there was an
 
04:46:29.030 --> 04:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
effort to repeal the johnson amendment
 
04:46:31.110 --> 04:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
that would have allowed more political
 
04:46:33.030 --> 04:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
money to move through the doc the the
 
04:46:34.470 --> 04:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
non-profit sector
 
04:46:35.430 --> 04:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
that we
 
04:46:37.510 --> 04:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
we work to oppose
 
04:46:37.520 --> 04:46:39.270 align:start position:0%
we work to oppose
um

04:46:39.270 --> 04:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:41.510 --> 04:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
we also as as noted earlier by the
 
04:46:44.788 --> 04:46:44.798 align:start position:0%
charitable trust unit our trust our
 
04:46:47.750 --> 04:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
doj here in the state does not ask for a
 
04:46:50.070 --> 04:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
donor list they never have
 
04:46:52.708 --> 04:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
and this is already settled law in the
 
04:46:55.270 --> 04:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
um in the banta decision that's been
 
04:46:57.590 --> 04:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned overall we do find this
 
04:47:00.310 --> 04:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and potentially harmful we
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
do appreciate there was some efforts to
 
04:47:03.910 --> 04:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
amend the legislation in the senate but
 
04:47:06.230 --> 04:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
we don't think it went far enough it's
 
04:47:08.230 --> 04:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
still a head scratcher for many of our
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
members things that have come up can we
 
04:47:12.550 --> 04:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
publicly thank volunteers
 
04:47:15.670 --> 04:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
can we publicly thank donors i mean we
 
04:47:17.110 --> 04:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
know that that's kind of the bread and
 
04:47:18.948 --> 04:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
butter of a lot of nonprofits right is
 
04:47:21.270 --> 04:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
that is the list and that you're in this
 
04:47:23.350 --> 04:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
club and that club and we also know that
 
04:47:25.190 --> 04:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
so many of our nonprofits honor
 
04:47:28.230 --> 04:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
anonymity regularly for donors who who
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
request it um
 
04:47:32.868 --> 04:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
what about the administrative burdens of
 
04:47:34.948 --> 04:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
compulsory confidentiality what does
 
04:47:37.670 --> 04:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
that look like and what happens if they
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
make an error um and uh and and uh have
 
04:47:43.750 --> 04:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
inadvertent disclosures um this was not
 
04:47:45.430 --> 04:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
a concern raised
 
04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
inside the state by the nonprofit sector
 
04:47:49.910 --> 04:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
and seems to go further than needed
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
um this is new hampshire we need to be
 
04:47:53.670 --> 04:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
accountable to one another and so we
 
04:47:55.830 --> 04:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
urge your committee to find uh the the
 
04:48:00.230 --> 04:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:02.150 --> 04:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative simpsons
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:48:05.590 --> 04:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for this and thank you for
 
04:48:07.510 --> 04:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
04:48:09.350 --> 04:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
i actually had a question about the
 
04:48:11.190 --> 04:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
penalties section and so i'm glad that
 
04:48:14.230 --> 04:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
you raised it um
 
04:48:15.910 --> 04:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
we haven't talked really about it yet
 
04:48:17.750 --> 04:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
but i wonder if your
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
organization had a response specifically
 
04:48:21.590 --> 04:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:48:22.868 --> 04:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
like the dollar amounts and the
 
04:48:25.030 --> 04:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
penalties or how that would work or did
 
04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
you talk about that yeah i don't think
 
04:48:28.948 --> 04:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
i'm prepared to talk specifically about
 
04:48:30.948 --> 04:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
the the penalties in the in the proposal
 
04:48:33.190 --> 04:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
but just to say it it's as we talked
 
04:48:34.310 --> 04:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
about the
 
04:48:35.590 --> 04:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
this kind of
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
scrappy nature of a lot of our community
 
04:48:40.070 --> 04:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
organizations that they're so impactful
 
04:48:41.590 --> 04:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
you know any kind of additional
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
administrative burdens um you know could
 
04:48:45.910 --> 04:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
be a concern and obviously if there are
 
04:48:47.830 --> 04:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
penalties associated with that that
 
04:48:49.910 --> 04:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
could have a real adverse consequence on
 
04:48:51.670 --> 04:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
a smaller nonprofit there are also
 
04:48:53.670 --> 04:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
issues around like there's some safety
 
04:48:55.430 --> 04:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
issues that have come up like what if
 
04:48:57.430 --> 04:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
there's a question about a coach and
 
04:48:59.030 --> 04:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
some background that a coach and what if
 
04:49:00.948 --> 04:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
a parent makes an inquiry
 
04:49:04.230 --> 04:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
like and and just we we would be putting
 
04:49:06.948 --> 04:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
we'd be tying the hands
 
04:49:09.270 --> 04:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
of a system that seems to be working for
 
04:49:12.310 --> 04:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:14.070 --> 04:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
represent macbeth
 
04:49:15.750 --> 04:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chair gordon and thank you for
 
04:49:17.030 --> 04:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:49:19.910 --> 04:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
so out of your 700 members or whatever
 
04:49:21.510 --> 04:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
have you and i know times are different
 
04:49:23.110 --> 04:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
but have you noticed any of this donor
 
04:49:25.350 --> 04:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
fatigue or is there
 
04:49:28.868 --> 04:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
a drop-off in um you know
 
04:49:32.150 --> 04:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
donor participation or contribution
 
04:49:35.430 --> 04:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
um well as so new hampshire gives is
 
04:49:37.510 --> 04:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
right around the corner and last year
 
04:49:39.350 --> 04:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
was the the most successful new
 
04:49:41.510 --> 04:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire gives we've ever had
 
04:49:41.520 --> 04:49:42.628 align:start position:0%
hampshire gives we've ever had
um

04:49:42.628 --> 04:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:45.430 --> 04:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh granite staters have been
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
very generous in response to the
 
04:49:47.280 --> 04:49:48.868 align:start position:0%
very generous in response to the
pandemic

04:49:48.868 --> 04:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
04:49:50.628 --> 04:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
and i think our government leaders as
 
04:49:52.868 --> 04:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
well in terms of making sure resources
 
04:49:54.550 --> 04:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
could uh get to the nonprofits the
 
04:49:57.270 --> 04:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
non-profit emergency relief program that
 
04:49:59.190 --> 04:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
came out of the karzak money we were the
 
04:50:01.030 --> 04:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
first state in the country to make sure
 
04:50:03.510 --> 04:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
that we were bolstering non-profits and
 
04:50:05.990 --> 04:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
philanthropy i think generally is has
 
04:50:08.868 --> 04:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
increased in the state on a national
 
04:50:11.510 --> 04:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
basis our numbers look lower than other
 
04:50:13.110 --> 04:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
states but that could be because of the
 
04:50:15.350 --> 04:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
way it's counted um
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
and connected to religious organizations
 
04:50:18.788 --> 04:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
because we have fewer of them in this
 
04:50:18.798 --> 04:50:20.150 align:start position:0%
because we have fewer of them in this
state

04:50:20.150 --> 04:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:50:21.910 --> 04:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:31.270 --> 04:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
so i've noticed these philanthropic
 
04:50:33.270 --> 04:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
organizations um
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
they often advertise you know you look
 
04:50:36.310 --> 04:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
at their
 
04:50:37.670 --> 04:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
their websites they frequently talk
 
04:50:39.190 --> 04:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
about all the other philanthropic
 
04:50:40.868 --> 04:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
organizations that they're associated
 
04:50:42.868 --> 04:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
with so they're not necessarily
 
04:50:44.868 --> 04:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
i mean some people do make anonymous
 
04:50:46.230 --> 04:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
donations but they're not necessarily
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
secretive about who they're working with
 
04:50:50.390 --> 04:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
when it comes to talking to potential
 
04:50:52.868 --> 04:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
donors but it seems like uh
 
04:50:54.310 --> 04:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
this would shut
 
04:50:57.030 --> 04:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
um government agencies including law
 
04:50:58.948 --> 04:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement and also uh
 
04:51:01.590 --> 04:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
you know government agencies that are
 
04:51:03.670 --> 04:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
sub contracting with these organizations
 
04:51:05.030 --> 04:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
so it seems like this
 
04:51:07.190 --> 04:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
would uh shut off a lot of oversight
 
04:51:09.430 --> 04:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
well without restricting their ability
 
04:51:09.440 --> 04:51:10.390 align:start position:0%
well without restricting their ability
to

04:51:10.390 --> 04:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:51:10.400 --> 04:51:11.350 align:start position:0%
to
um

04:51:11.350 --> 04:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:13.830 --> 04:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
use their affiliations to promote
 
04:51:15.190 --> 04:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
themselves to
 
04:51:15.200 --> 04:51:15.990 align:start position:0%
themselves to
the

04:51:15.990 --> 04:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:51:17.670 --> 04:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
potential donors or other groups they
 
04:51:19.590 --> 04:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
want to partner with thank you for the
 
04:51:22.390 --> 04:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
question representative and as the
 
04:51:23.990 --> 04:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
charitable trust unit
 
04:51:25.990 --> 04:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
noted earlier
 
04:51:27.990 --> 04:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
identifying scamming you know is really
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
important in uh in the nonprofit sector
 
04:51:32.550 --> 04:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
so if you are
 
04:51:34.868 --> 04:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
a veritable non-profit doing good say
 
04:51:36.310 --> 04:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
around breast cancer i know in my
 
04:51:38.390 --> 04:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
community we have a great organization
 
04:51:41.510 --> 04:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
called breast cancer stories
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
and uh and another entity that you know
 
04:51:47.350 --> 04:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
comes in and is fraudulently um securing
 
04:51:49.110 --> 04:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
funds from your community that's less

and
 
04:52:14.070 --> 04:52:14.080 align:start position:0%

04:52:21.270 --> 04:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
04:52:22.470 --> 04:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
the committee i apologize for not
 
04:52:23.830 --> 04:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
putting in a testimony request my name
 
04:52:25.510 --> 04:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
is john conforti i represent the new
 
04:52:28.390 --> 04:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire lottery um and i will be brief
 
04:52:30.150 --> 04:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh the new hampshire lottery commission
 
04:52:32.550 --> 04:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
oversees charitable gaming in the state
 
04:52:36.070 --> 04:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
um games of chance bingo lucky seven um
 
04:52:37.910 --> 04:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
and we're not taking a position on this
 
04:52:40.150 --> 04:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
bill but we did want to um
 
04:52:42.550 --> 04:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
identify that there are elements of
 
04:52:45.030 --> 04:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
senate bill 302 which are in conflict
 
04:52:49.350 --> 04:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
with um some of the current uh statutes
 
04:52:51.030 --> 04:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
relating to
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
bingo lucky seven
 
04:52:54.868 --> 04:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
and games of chance i doubt that bingo
 
04:52:57.110 --> 04:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
was top of mind when this uh
 
04:52:59.830 --> 04:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
legislation was drafted um so we wanted
 
04:53:02.948 --> 04:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
to just make a note of the fact that
 
04:53:05.350 --> 04:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
as regulators of that entity we do
 
04:53:05.360 --> 04:53:06.390 align:start position:0%
as regulators of that entity we do
request

04:53:06.390 --> 04:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
request
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
during the application process and
 
04:53:10.390 --> 04:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
during our financial reviews
 
04:53:12.550 --> 04:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
who is involved in the charity with
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
these games
 
04:53:15.670 --> 04:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
in the case of bingo and lucky seven the
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
charities themselves actually operate
 
04:53:18.628 --> 04:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
the games
 
04:53:21.190 --> 04:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
and therefore we do require oversight to
 
04:53:23.110 --> 04:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
know who those members are that are
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
participating um and so there are a
 
04:53:28.948 --> 04:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
number of statutes to a7d6
 
04:53:31.510 --> 04:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
287 d22
 
04:53:37.270 --> 04:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
287 e5 e7 e9 e21 and e24 all of which
 
04:53:39.910 --> 04:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
would be impacted by senate bill 302 um
 
04:53:42.230 --> 04:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
would restrict our ability to identify
 
04:53:44.708 --> 04:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
and be able to license uh charities for
 
04:53:46.868 --> 04:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
that gaming activity um this is
 
04:53:49.510 --> 04:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
obviously all voluntary activity on
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of the charity um that they come
 
04:53:54.628 --> 04:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
to us seeking a license we do not go out
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
to them
 
04:53:59.350 --> 04:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
but we do would would encourage you to
 
04:54:01.590 --> 04:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
consider if this legislation is moving
 
04:54:01.600 --> 04:54:02.708 align:start position:0%
consider if this legislation is moving
forward

04:54:02.708 --> 04:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:54:04.788 --> 04:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
consider an exemption
 
04:54:06.948 --> 04:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
for those statutes that are currently in
 
04:54:09.190 --> 04:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
place which allow us
 
04:54:12.390 --> 04:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
to license those charities for
 
04:54:14.470 --> 04:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming be happy to take any
 
04:54:14.480 --> 04:54:17.510 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming be happy to take any
questions

04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:19.270 --> 04:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative wolper

thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:54:22.708 --> 04:54:22.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you give us that
 
04:54:24.390 --> 04:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
list i mean
 
04:54:26.070 --> 04:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
i can and i can also submit it
 
04:54:28.070 --> 04:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
afterwards if that would be easier
 
04:54:30.070 --> 04:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
whichever way it works okay i just want
 
04:54:31.430 --> 04:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
to get it
 
04:54:33.350 --> 04:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
i think just to to to be on the safe
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
side i i can submit that to to you and
 
04:54:39.510 --> 04:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
the chair um after this hearing
 
04:54:41.430 --> 04:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
that'd be super if you send it to us in
 
04:54:42.868 --> 04:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
an email we'll distribute it to the
 
04:54:45.990 --> 04:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
committee excellent thank you
 
04:54:48.150 --> 04:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
04:54:50.628 --> 04:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you very much
 
04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me why given the
 
04:54:56.550 --> 04:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
strength of your testimony which seems
 
04:54:58.708 --> 04:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
to me to be rather important
 
04:55:00.628 --> 04:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
nonetheless you're not taking a position
 
04:55:03.510 --> 04:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
on the bill uh it's our position as an
 
04:55:05.990 --> 04:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
agency uh not to take a position on the
 
04:55:07.830 --> 04:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
overall bill and again
 
04:55:11.030 --> 04:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
with we just wanted to
 
04:55:13.510 --> 04:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
let make note that there's a technical
 
04:55:14.948 --> 04:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
issue between
 
04:55:14.958 --> 04:55:15.830 align:start position:0%
issue between
uh

04:55:15.830 --> 04:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:55:18.470 --> 04:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
standing law right now and and the bill
 
04:55:22.150 --> 04:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
um as an agency we we try not to um to
 
04:55:24.310 --> 04:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
take positions on bills we just try to
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
educate um to to
 
04:55:28.550 --> 04:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
tell you what the impact would be for
 
04:55:29.990 --> 04:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
our agency
 
04:55:30.000 --> 04:55:31.670 align:start position:0%
our agency
um

04:55:31.670 --> 04:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:33.830 --> 04:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:55:35.670 --> 04:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative oregon
 
04:55:37.590 --> 04:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
yes when i heard the words trust in
 
04:55:39.030 --> 04:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
lottery in the same paragraph i
 
04:55:42.150 --> 04:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
immediately thought of uh
 
04:55:43.830 --> 04:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
immediately thought of device to set up
 
04:55:43.840 --> 04:55:44.470 align:start position:0%
immediately thought of device to set up
a

04:55:44.470 --> 04:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:55:47.030 --> 04:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
trust to receive the winnings of your
 
04:55:48.390 --> 04:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
lottery ticket but i guess that would
 
04:55:50.230 --> 04:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
normally not be a charitable trust
 
04:55:51.910 --> 04:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
although i suppose it could be if that's
 
04:55:54.150 --> 04:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
what the winner wanted to do so is
 
04:55:55.510 --> 04:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
anything in that bill which would
 
04:55:57.590 --> 04:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
interfere with uh
 
04:55:59.670 --> 04:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
that practice which many jackpot winners
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh choose to take advantage of
 
04:56:04.390 --> 04:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
it it should not because as as you're as
 
04:56:08.628 --> 04:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
you identify that is those are not 501c
 
04:56:12.628 --> 04:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
um trusts or or charitable organizations
 
04:56:13.750 --> 04:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:56:15.110 --> 04:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:56:17.030 --> 04:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
that claim those tickets we have had
 
04:56:18.628 --> 04:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
charities where we've had people who've
 
04:56:20.230 --> 04:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
donated the tickets to charities and
 
04:56:21.990 --> 04:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
they come forward but they're also more
 
04:56:23.830 --> 04:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
than happy to um
 
04:56:25.830 --> 04:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
publicize that they've uh they've won
 
04:56:28.070 --> 04:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
powerball or mega millions and we're
 
04:56:30.070 --> 04:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
very happy to provide them with that
 
04:56:30.080 --> 04:56:31.590 align:start position:0%
very happy to provide them with that
check

04:56:31.590 --> 04:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
check
 
04:56:33.670 --> 04:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
all right thanks
 
04:56:34.868 --> 04:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
representative chase did you have a
 
04:56:37.190 --> 04:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you thanks for taking my
 
04:56:39.030 --> 04:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
question i'm just looking at the report
 
04:56:41.110 --> 04:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
from the senate did you bring these up
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
in front of the senate and um
 
04:56:46.070 --> 04:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
what what did they say we did not
 
04:56:48.310 --> 04:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
represent chase we were not advised of
 
04:56:50.310 --> 04:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
the bill and and we were not aware of
 
04:56:52.150 --> 04:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
the bill as it went through the senate
 
04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
um the department of justice made us
 
04:56:57.190 --> 04:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
aware uh of the bill's presence um
 
04:56:59.190 --> 04:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
during the at the end of the senate
 
04:57:01.430 --> 04:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
process after it had already uh passed
 
04:57:03.750 --> 04:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
through so we did not have an
 
04:57:05.350 --> 04:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity or we missed on the
 
04:57:07.350 --> 04:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to identify these issues for
 
04:57:09.430 --> 04:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
the senate so that is ultimately our
 
04:57:11.270 --> 04:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility we just we were not aware
 
04:57:13.910 --> 04:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:16.470 --> 04:57:16.480 align:start position:0%

04:57:33.430 --> 04:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative macbeth you asked if you
 
04:57:35.830 --> 04:57:35.840 align:start position:0%

the tax relief that donors get
 
04:57:49.830 --> 04:57:49.840 align:start position:0%

the public
 
04:58:02.320 --> 04:58:03.190 align:start position:0%
the public
uh

04:58:03.190 --> 04:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:58:05.350 --> 04:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
first of all charities serve public
 
04:58:05.360 --> 04:58:06.470 align:start position:0%
first of all charities serve public
purposes

04:58:06.470 --> 04:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
04:58:09.030 --> 04:58:09.040 align:start position:0%

04:58:12.310 --> 04:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
tax exemption inc federal income tax and
 
04:58:14.788 --> 04:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
oftentimes property taxes

so it's because they serve that public
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
purpose that they get those exemptions
 
04:58:21.910 --> 04:58:21.920 align:start position:0%

04:58:25.030 --> 04:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
oversight and some transparency
 
04:58:25.040 --> 04:58:26.070 align:start position:0%
oversight and some transparency
