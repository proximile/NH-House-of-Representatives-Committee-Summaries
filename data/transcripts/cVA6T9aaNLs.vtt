everyone uh I apologize for being late
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%

with that we open our hearing on the
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
retained bail bills I understand we have
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
someone um today Allison from Chester
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
please red light is on red light means
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
go that's counterintuitive to me because
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
I'm on a lot of boards and okay all
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
right good morning uh my name is Allison
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
Welsh I'm from chesher County I have
 
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
been the treatment Court coordinator
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
which is the drug court we just changed
 
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
our name a couple years ago since
 
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.590 align:start position:0%
our name a couple years ago since
September

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
September
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
2013 um since its Inception and I also
 
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
provide oversight to the behavioral
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
health court programs which are
 
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
alternative sentencing and mental health
 
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
court and I know you're specifically
 
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
interested in pre-trial programs we sort
 
00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:54.519 align:start position:0%
of have a hybrid right now I have spoken
 
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
several times with our County attorney
 
00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
Chris mcgoffin who's also interested in
 
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
having pre- trial programming expanding
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
it um and he has a vision for it I can
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
talk about that later on I will say that
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
straford is clearly the model for the
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
state they're also much bigger than we
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
are um but Carrie Conway does a
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
phenomenal job they have few more
 
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
programs and we do we're doing our best
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
you know I don't have to remind everyone
 
00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
here we're very rural community we do
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
our best with the resources we have so
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
we we'll never have the census of those
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
large counties I remember hearing Carrie
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
say they have 500 people in their
 
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
programming if I total like the jail
 
00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:34.519 align:start position:0%
population people in drug court
 
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
behavioral health court programs and
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
even on pre-trial I wouldn't get to 500
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
so let me just start with the fact that
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
of the 10 drug courts in the state we
 
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
all follow best practice we're all
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
evidence-based but we're all completely
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
different we have different models even
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
though we try to be the same we
 
00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate the funding and we do really
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
well like for my drug court alone we
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
have the state funding which is
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
phenomenal but we also have opioid
 
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
funding from the settlement we have the
 
00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:07.959 align:start position:0%
M funding and we also wrote a bja grant
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
for our recovery coach because we felt
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
like that role is a really important
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
role to have in every team and that's
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
becoming a best practice and
 
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
samama and the nadcp allrise who set the
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
guidelines for drug courts are now
 
00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
recommending peer support recovery
 
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
coaches on every team and are releasing
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
guidelines this month hopefully soon so
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sure like some of the more important
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
things for you and I know you're going
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
to barrage me with questions I'm ready
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
um are the financials so and this went
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
up significantly since I last got these
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
numbers so to incarcerate someone for a
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
year in chesher County the current cost
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
and this was done by Cheryl Trombley
 
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
who's phenomenal head of Finance at the
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
county so the current cost is
 
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
$68,900 and I know you were hearing per
 
00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
DM so that's 189 per DM roughly to put
 
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
someone out Out On Em which all of our
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
programs use the EM at the jail and
 
00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
Captain blasic does a great job there
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
the rough cost was
 
00:14:11.749 --> 00:14:11.759 align:start position:0%
2592 which is about $710 a
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
day and I'll say that she does a sliding
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
scale so that's different for
 
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.910 align:start position:0%
scale so that's different for
everyone

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
the drug court estimate and I have
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
estimates for different years per
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
participant is
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
14,27 so a significant saving for
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
putting someone in jail clearly and that
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
perum is about
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
3910 Behavioral Health Port
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
programs and I'm sure you've heard about
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
the workforce shortage so I typically
 
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
have two full-time case managers Who
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
oversee both programs during coid we
 
00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:50.839 align:start position:0%
lost one staff member who wanted to work
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
from home we were all back full-time so
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
my budgets are a little different so I
 
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
have twoyear budgets just so you have
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
that so uh
 
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
2022 the budget was lower because we
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
weren't at full capacity staff-wise so
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
that's average per client so drug court
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
we talk participants behavioral health
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
court We Talk clients so that average
 
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
cost was
 
00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:16.839 align:start position:0%
$2,820 per client at a pum of
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
$773 in 2021 when we were fully staffed
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
$3,725 per
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
client and
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
$102 per DM that said the numbers vary a
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
little bit in the program level too so
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
those costs probably are more in the
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
line the alternative sentencing program
 
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
was started in 2001 and was the first
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
problem solving Court in the state um
 
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
and so trees tends to be Progressive and
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
it's very collaborative community so the
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
alternative sentencing program works
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
with people with a substance use
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
disorder and they've been charged with a
 
00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:53.629 align:start position:0%
disorder and they've been charged with a
criminal

00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
offense the mental health court program
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't get the exact date CU I
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
wasn't there with when they started it
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
started in either 2004 or 5 I reached
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
out to the former coordinator and he
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't remember and that's why he's
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
not working with us anymore just kidding
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
um anyway it's an alternative to the
 
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
traditional court system it's a problem
 
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
solving model and we connect uh
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
individuals diagnosed with the mental
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
health disorder and or substance use
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
disorder to a variety of rehabilitative
 
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
services and support networks and I'll
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
tell you that population is typically
 
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
severe and persistent mental illness in
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
a very complex
 
00:16:28.829 --> 00:16:28.839 align:start position:0%
population um and then for that program
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
we do monthly Court reviews for the
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
people that are in Superior Court and I
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
know you've heard a lot of testimony
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
overwhelming number of cases in circuit
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
court so our Circuit Court judges are
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
very supportive of the programming but
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
we've not been able to set up monthly
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
reviews we're trying and they've reached
 
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
out to me a few times so we do have a
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
meeting to try to see if we can set that
 
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
up now that we're fully staffed we do
 
00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:54.759 align:start position:0%
have both case managers in arraignments
 
00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
for the Circuit Court um arraignment
 
00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
days on Tuesdays and Thursdays so
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
they're um taking in more assessments
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
typically the judge will say can you
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
assess them and so I just was reaching
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
out to my case manager she said she gets
 
00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:11.799 align:start position:0%
six to eight month six to eight
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
assessments per month so once again a
 
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
much smaller volume than what you guys
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
hearing um referral to the behavioral
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
health court programs can be made by
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
prosecution defense attorney probation
 
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
District or Superior Court
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
Judge they're usually part of the
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
Criminal Court and they can be pre-trial
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
as a condition of bail or post
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
adjudication as part of an individual
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
sentence uh so I just want to give you
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
some background of what that program
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
does and hopefully that's helpful so
 
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
when someone comes in the counselors do
 
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
a full bioc psychos social analysis and
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
they're both trained um Judy's and mlak
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
and our new hired Lisa worth is an mssw
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
so they fill out a full bioc
 
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
psychosocial and then from that they
 
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
create an individual service plan that
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
the client signs off on um and then they
 
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
do a myriad of referrals in the
 
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
community so they're typically referred
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
to Community Mental Health Center and so
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
that again is a little bit of an issue
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
for us right now we've had a contract
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
with them for years and when I met with
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
the executive director and I he's a man
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
who's brilliant and I respect him Phil
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
weak he said I can't in good conscience
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
sign this
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
contract and what that contract did was
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
expedited services for people in our
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
programs so he said he could not sign it
 
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
because he was down 38 in stad
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure this is like you've heard
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
this repeatedly we have a staff shortage
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
issue for licensed counselors in the
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
state um so we in those programs
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
everyone if you're not insured while
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
you're before you enter the program
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
you're certainly insured while you're in
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
the program before I came on Medicaid
 
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
expansion wasn't part of it um so the
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
cost of the program was much higher for
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
the county since Medicaid expansion has
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
taken place are costs for the program
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
which is why the cost that I gave you
 
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
earlier per client is down significantly
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
so we used to have to pay for treatment
 
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
for clients so now all of our clients
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
are covered by either Medicaid or some
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
form of Medicare as
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
well um each client gets full Case
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
Management Services each week they come
 
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
in uh they're referred for employment
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
services educational such as high set
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
tutoring vocational training parenting
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
classes giving housing assistance and
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
there's a pilot program that I created
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
with Keen housing for initially
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
treatment court and now we've expanded
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
to Alternative sentencing not yet mental
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
health court and it's a voucher program
 
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
where participants or clients pay 20% of
 
00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
their rent up into a certain amount so
 
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
that's a new program Keen housing's been
 
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
phenomenal with that the case managers
 
00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
work on helping get clients Med
 
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
stabilized they do a full money
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
management plan budgeting and we have
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
Housing Programs we work closely with
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
the shelter city of keen 100 nights
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
Southwestern and we also if they don't
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
have phones or can't get phones through
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
SafeLink part of our budget has been
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
providing phones and phone cards
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
especially during coid when all of our
 
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
treatment was tellah health and case
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
management was tella health and
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
transportation I'm sure you've heard
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
transportation and housing are the
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
biggest barriers for everyone especially
 
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
in rural communities like us there's a
 
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
wonderful man in Dublin New Hampshire
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
who has a program peace for B bikes
 
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
bikes for peace sorry Jeff um Powell and
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
he has donated so far about 20 bikes in
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
the last couple of months that's not
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
going to be great for the winter but
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
it's been incredibly helpful we also
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
provide bus passes but the bus has a
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
very limited route I am on a local um
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
mrcc which is trying to expand
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
transportation in our community working
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
closely with Mobility managers through
 
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.630 align:start position:0%
closely with Mobility managers through
through

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
Southwestern the program also has
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
randomized UA testing we do with a
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.590 align:start position:0%
 
center

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
um I think I've already gone through a
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
lot of budget numbers with you just so
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
that program typically like if you are
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
flawless and perfect which we don't
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
expect it's 90 days but we have people
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
in that program for two to three
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
years um we've had a lot of success and
 
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
I know you're more interested in
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
pre-trial so I'll tell you like in 2022
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
31 people were pre-trial 15 were post
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
adjudication for the mental health court
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
eight were pre- trial and five or post
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
adjudication for um the alternative
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
sentencing and
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
2021 27 were pre-trial and 36 were post
 
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
adjudication so for this current year
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
which still is not resolved um we have
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
to like right now 13 clients active in
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
those two programs 35 since the
 
00:21:45.269 --> 00:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
beginning of the
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
year 14 clients have successfully
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
completed the program so it's a 64%
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
completion rate eight have been
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
discharged and I'll tell you that they
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
get lots and lots of chances for
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
someone's discharged similar with drug
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
court it takes us a long time DET
 
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
terminate someone in 2022 there were 49
 
00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.350 align:start position:0%
terminate someone in 2022 there were 49
clients

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
clients
 
00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:06.279 align:start position:0%
15 24 successfully completed the program
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
so it's 73% rate which is great I'm
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
hoping that we get back up there nine
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
clients were discharged and one client
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
sadly passed away and I can continue on
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
those numbers I don't know I know you've
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about drug court I'm not
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
sure how much you want me to go into
 
00:22:19.559 --> 00:22:20.390 align:start position:0%
sure how much you want me to go into
drug

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
drug
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
court only as much as it uh deals with
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
pre-trial or so the drug court model is
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
post adjudication Okay so no not at all
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so um I'll tell you that uh it's
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
post adjudication and I know some people
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
spoke of other tracks so we are
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
high-risk high like everyone else around
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
the state the only one thing we do
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
differently and we've only had one
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
person take advantage of this is if it's
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
your first felony offense and you
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
successfully complete the program you
 
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
will not get a felony
 
00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:54.039 align:start position:0%
record but it's kind of hard to hit high
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
risk High need and not have several
 
00:22:59.470 --> 00:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
felonies most of our population has you
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
know about 5 10 page WRA sheet uh a
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
little background on me I was a
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
prosecutor in Manhattan and a public
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
vender in Oregon so I was a lawyer many
 
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
many years ago so I have a criminal
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
justice background not clinician not
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
clinical at all so uh we are fortunate
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the sense that we have a lot of
 
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
funding um from the county we also have
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
a friends group they initially were the
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
friends of cheser County Drug Court we
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
changed our name to treatment court and
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
then when I started to oversee the
 
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
behavioral health court programs they're
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
now the friends of chesher County
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
Recovery Court programs so they provide
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
us with a lot of incentive funding we
 
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
have a contingency Management program in
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
the um behavioral healthc programs that
 
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
they fully fund they provide incentives
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
they provide phones they've delivered
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
food for people for us for when they had
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
coid and they're super supportive they
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
also we've had um Chamber of Commerce
 
00:23:57.149 --> 00:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
presentations reduced stigma around
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
mental health we another one coming up
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
November 13th in cheser County so it's
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
community members Allison if I may it
 
00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:06.039 align:start position:0%
not not to interrupt you but it's what
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
you're speaking of specifically the the
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
behavioral health that you're you know
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
you're kind of mentioning like
 
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
scattering a little bit and I know I
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
speak for pretty much every member of
 
00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:18.039 align:start position:0%
this committee when I say we are hearing
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
so much about that every single day and
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things of course being from
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
cheser County I've been saying we we
 
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
have this we have this we have this and
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
I was talking with Chris last week and
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
he had mentioned that and correct me
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
where you can if I'm wrong here that the
 
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
state did adopt it it was almost like a
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
grant program and that chesher County
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
grabbed hold of that several years ago
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
and then made that be what it is today
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
so one of the questions we're hearing so
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
much about is you know State unfunded
 
00:24:53.789 --> 00:24:53.799 align:start position:0%
mandates could you talk a little bit
 
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
about how it was that chesher County
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
came to adopt this behavior health
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
program and how and where it is today
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
because of that so yeah that happened
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
before my time so I've been there since
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
2013 I know that uh we're a very
 
00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:12.039 align:start position:0%
Progressive County and a lot of people
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
were not thrilled with the incarceration
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
rates and our incarceration have gone
 
00:25:18.669 --> 00:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
significantly down so they did create
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
programming a lot of the sentiment in
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
the county is to get treatment provide
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
help beforehand so you don't continue
 
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
incarceration tell you the most
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
frustrating thing in my role uh I
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
received a lot of calls when I first
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
started about people wanting to get
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
their children in drug court and I said
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
unless you want them to go out and
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
commit about 20 crimes I'm never going
 
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
to see them but a lot of these programs
 
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
developed because you couldn't get
 
00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:46.039 align:start position:0%
access to treatment so we had to develop
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
relationships with the community mental
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
health centers with local treatment
 
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
providers to create access I mean a lot
 
00:25:54.269 --> 00:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
of the crimes kept happening because
 
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
they were drug rated so the program has
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
expanded over the years years to get
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
access to treatment get access to
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
medications and to stabilize individuals
 
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
community so basically there was a lot
 
00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.070 align:start position:0%
community so basically there was a lot
of

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
advocacy there was a lot of advocacy
 
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
between the leadership of the county and
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
then the various cap programs that the
 
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
county has and like the drug court
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
funding a lot of the programs started by
 
00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
federal funding sure and then became
 
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the county and the the
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
youth the youth
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
diversion program I I know we we've you
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
know we speak of that a lot whenever
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
we're in our executive County for those
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
of you that don't know I'm obviously in
 
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.549 align:start position:0%
of you that don't know I'm obviously in
chesher

00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
chesher
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
County um we speak a lot about the youth
 
00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:42.039 align:start position:0%
diversion program and I've talked to
 
00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
several people that have had children
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
that found themselves in some kind of
 
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
trouble and it it could have been
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
detrimental and that that path put them
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
right again if you will would you do you
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
have any information that you could
 
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit about that that's
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
funny CU I asked her to come speak last
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
week and she said there was some
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
representative from the program so I've
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
met with Alissa Bender I don't deal with
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
juveniles at all but I will say she's
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
phenomenal I mean while she's in that
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
job she's getting a master she's
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
expanding programming access she is very
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
involved in the community unfortunately
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
she's not affiliated with the county she
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
works at um so I don't deal with her but
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
I have met with her because she does
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
phenomenal work and I was on a youth
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
Coalition for a while and she was a
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
member of that and she does great things
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
with the youth maybe that's why our
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
numbers are down I but uh yeah I would
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
reach out to her if you have more
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
questions about the Juvenile Diversion
 
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
program but she does a phenomenal job
 
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
that um thank you can you um would you
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
tell the committee a little bit about um
 
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
how you you used the electronic
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
monitoring you said to good success how
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
do you who oversees it and who has the
 
00:27:57.149 --> 00:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
authority to pull somebody in if they're
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
violating their their bail conditions so
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
Captain blasic unfortunately she's in
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
Jamaica right now because I was calling
 
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
her before her flight uh she oversees
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
the program and um we don't typically
 
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
let me take a step back by saying that
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
in treatment Court we don't have a lot
 
00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
of people upconing I know you've
 
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
discussed a lot of failures to appear I
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
think because we're such a small
 
00:28:25.389 --> 00:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
community and like Keen is our city um I
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
guess I shouldn't do air quotes uh Keen
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
is our city and so the KPD know all of
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
our population like I can run into
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
anyone on the street andless say have
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
you seen so and so so like I can tell
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
you that for me as far as absconding
 
00:28:40.269 --> 00:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
I've had two names on my list for like
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
six years but I know by going on
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
Facebook one's in um Vegas and the other
 
00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:47.519 align:start position:0%
one's in Alabama and he actually just
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
reached out to try to clear it up so
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
people don't really leave where we are
 
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
it's a small sort of very tight-knit
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
Community Captain blasic does em for the
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
jail so the probation does not provide
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring so Captain blasic
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
has been doing it for several years and
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
she does have a standardized checklist
 
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
of who's appropriate I know they've
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
expanded it because the number of people
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
higher like there's several people that
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
are out on em I thought I had that
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
number with me I can get you that
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
number do you use it um strictly post
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
sentencing or do you use it to monitor
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
um people who are pre-trial so they have
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
several that are pre-trial okay and but
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
that's not a decision that I'm a part of
 
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:32.519 align:start position:0%
because I don't deal with the bail
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
Commissioners or bail at all okay do you
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
know who sets those who who who um who
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
imposes that condition is usually the
 
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919 align:start position:0%
court yes
 
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
okay and you spoke about the Medicaid um
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
we've heard that Counties have had a
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
difficult time getting reimbursement
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
unless someone is admitted to a hospital
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
have you found a way around that to get
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
Services um reimbursed so that's a jail
 
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
issue yeah and um it's a phenomenally
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
bad one for the jail because they spend
 
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of money yeah I know that the jail
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
did just receive an mud Grant to cover
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
some expenses and some mat expenses so
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
medication assisted treatment and so I
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
know they receiv received that but as
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
far as their medical bills no and um I
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
know someone else testified that once
 
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
someone's in a hospital and in then
 
00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:21.559 align:start position:0%
that'll be covered but yeah I was
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
working with Doug ywe for years trying
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
to figure a work around I mean that' be
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
wonderful if Med medical expens and
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
while incarcerated were not cut off yeah
 
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
it seems that there's a two systems
 
00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:35.799 align:start position:0%
working against each other the insurance
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
companies are incentivizing the
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals not to admit and if they don't
 
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
get admitted then Medicaid won't pay the
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
state or the county back for the
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
expenses so it's it it's going to need a
 
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
federal fix unfortunately I think
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
definely we'll certainly be advocating
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
for that any other questions from the
 
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
committee members represent Stone thank
 
00:30:58.269 --> 00:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
you under your program do you also have
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
individuals that are being supervised by
 
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
either probation or parole department of
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire so yes so for
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
treatment Court once and this happens a
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
little bit differently around the state
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
so when you plead into the treatment
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
Court program also known as drug court
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
you are um agreeing to five years
 
00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
probation so we have uh probation
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
officer on our team and he supervises
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
them for five years uh that's reduced to
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
3 years if you successfully complete the
 
00:31:27.629 --> 00:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
program and in Behavioral Health it's a
 
00:31:30.269 --> 00:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
mix if they're post adjudication and
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
they're sentenced to probation then yes
 
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:34.039 align:start position:0%
but not everyone who's in behavioral
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
health court programs is on
 
00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:37.470 align:start position:0%
health court programs is on
probation

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
probation
 
00:31:39.389 --> 00:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
followup and I take it there's no
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from the state to the
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
county to offset those costs is
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
there uh so um for the treatment Court
 
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
we don't pay for that supervision it's
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
just part of the
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
so representative wheeler thank you um
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
so people who don't have insurance when
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
they come to you you can get them into
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid or Medicare program
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
whatever would be most appropriate for
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
them for all of our programs that's
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
required okay um especially for a drug
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
court because we have treatment
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
providers now our treatment providers
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
are online and they bill
 
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so yes it's required for all of
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
our programs follow y when did that
 
00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
begin uh they had Insurance I've been
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else have any followup
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
questions we all set well thank you very
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
much for driving here today I sure do I
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
do know how far it is and um I will
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
certainly reach out to um to to Chris if
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
I have any further questions and while
 
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
we're here I would just like to take
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to tell everybody to
 
00:32:56.629 --> 00:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
tell everybody that is is thinking about
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
these program if your county doesn't
 
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
have them or if they have some of them
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
but not all of them reach out to your
 
00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
delegation we're all members of our
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
County delegation reach out to your
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
executive delegation reach out to your
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
Commissioners start the conversation and
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
make it happen because it can happen and
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
it and it really does great things if I
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
could add one more thing sorry um we
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
also have a restorative justice program
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
yes uh that's um overseen by Patrick
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
henahan and he was originally in the
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
victim Advocate because I was on his
 
00:33:26.669 --> 00:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
hiring committee and now they've created
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
a separate program so he goes into the
 
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
schools goes into the jails and is
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
creating programs aora of justice and
 
00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
he's working with some of the people in
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
behavioral health court as well so we're
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
constantly trying to expand our
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
programming but would love a robust
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
pre-trial Pro program for sure I have
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
these pamplets about some of the
 
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
programs if you guys would like those
 
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
and I have other P pamplets I can send
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
you so the the documentation that you
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
were looking off of earlier I don't know
 
00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
if you have that in a you know if you
 
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
could email us that and then we could
 
00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
print it off for people to be able to
 
00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
look at the numbers if you have it if
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
you don't um the other thing I was going
 
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
to ask if we could make a copy of it but
 
00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:03.559 align:start position:0%
I don't want to you know put you out or
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
make you uncomfortable if you're not
 
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
doing that comfortable with that I can
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
I'll send you my notes I mean all is is
 
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
just sort of notes kind of random that
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
would actually be very very helpful us
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm sorry I miss
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
muffin day I I know oh if if you don't
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
mind representative Harry gther yes um
 
00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
what was the person's name Patrick
 
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
Patrick henahan how do you spell that h
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
I tried to get him up here is is that
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
the restorative justice know so the
 
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
restorative justice
 
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
program speaking a little just a little
 
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
bit about my understanding is first of
 
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
all the the victim in the crime does not
 
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919 align:start position:0%
have to agree you know to the program it
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
is it is between it is between the
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
victim it is between the the perpetrator
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
and you know we do we have seen my
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
understanding is we have seen success
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
with it but I don't want anybody to
 
00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:02.839 align:start position:0%
think that that is something that that
 
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
the person that has been wronged has to
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
do right one of the things we always
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
talk about is you know the the victim
 
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
never being blamed for the crimes that
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
were committed against them but it is a
 
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
nice option that they have and you know
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
we have we have seen positive results
 
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
with it so we're kicking butt down there
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else we're all set
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
1993 when I came to Manchester New
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 1993 from New York
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
City I thought I thought I went to
 
00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
another world because in '93 there was
 
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
no drugs there was hardly no homeless
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
problem Manchester was a beautiful place
 
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
okay and I did come to Manchester New
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the wrong reasons and I'm
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
going to get to that but the reason why
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
I'm here today is because um a lot of
 
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
the things that we're doing in my
 
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
opinion is not
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
working um and I know some people will
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
agree and some people won't agree so to
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
those who don't agree with me what I'm
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
about to say is what I'm going to say
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
first have you ever smuggled drugs
 
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
across state lines have you ever
 
00:38:58.349 --> 00:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
packaged drugs for sale have you ever
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
lived in a poor Community like that have
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
you ever been to prison have you ever
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
had to deal with any of that chaotic
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
stuff and if the answer is no then we're
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
all due respect from the bottom of my
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
heart then I'm sorry you don't know how
 
00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
to fix this problem okay it would be the
 
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
equivalent of asking me to go into
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
Suburbia world and try to fix a problem
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
up there I don't know I don't know
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
anything from there I'm not from there
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
I'm from I'm from what they call the
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
ghetto or the hoods or bad
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.589 align:start position:0%
ghetto or the hoods or bad
areas

00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
prison reform Bale reform is a joke I'm
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
tell you that right now and this is
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
coming from my ex drug dealer I did 10
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
years in prison in federal state prison
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
not proud of it but B reform doesn't
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
work it's a joke
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
um you know you have people I know a lot
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
of officers in
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester that say say to me you know I
 
00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
can't even finish my paperwork and this
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
guy or girl is already walking out the
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
door you know and and and committing the
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
same crime two hours later I'm chasing
 
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
him around the city again so that's not
 
00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:04.359 align:start position:0%
working um B reform is not working at
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
all we need to we need to go back to
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
what it was here's the big one minimum
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
mandatories if you're against that you
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to fix the
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
problem bottom line straight up and this
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
is coming from a person that at one
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
point I would never speak this
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
way minimum mandatories whoever thinks
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
blowing people's heads off and putting
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
him in jails and and burying him into
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
the jail is not the answer oh you can't
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
do that then again sorry with all
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
respect you don't know how to fix this
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
problem I'll tell you what brought me to
 
00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:39.079 align:start position:0%
new ham and what brings and what brought
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
me to New Ham 30 years ago and it's
 
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
still bringing people here
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
today I came here to I came here in
 
00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
1993 because again remember the life
 
00:40:51.069 --> 00:40:51.079 align:start position:0%
side I told you I came
 
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
from some guy came to me and told me hey
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
that piece of crack that you're selling
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
for $3 you get $30 for that in New
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
Hamshire I was up here that same week
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
never went
 
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
back so what's happening is that you're
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
getting a lot of drug dealers 95 96 97%
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
of your drug dealers are not from the
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
state they're from out of state they
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
come here because their kilo that cost
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
$20,000 in their state is a 100,000 here
 
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
and we're not doing nothing to
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
them they're getting caught and they're
 
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:24.710 align:start position:0%
them they're getting caught and they're
being

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
released there's no punishment for them
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
there's nothing
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
so again you know we need we need
 
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
minimum mandatories you want to scare
 
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
away a drug dealer um this is the next
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
drug dealer you're looking at you're
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
going to scare them with minimum
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
mandatories if they know they're going
 
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:43.720 align:start position:0%
to come to New Hampshire and get put
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
under the jail for selling drugs they're
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
not going to come here they're going to
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
choose another state why you think a lot
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
of guys don't go to
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
main a lot of Street guys don't go to
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
Maine Maine will bury you in the jail
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
so if you think that minimum mandatories
 
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
don't work you do not want to fix the
 
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
problem period and I'm tired of burying
 
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
close friends of minees family members
 
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
because nobody wants to fix the problem
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
this is this is not this is this is not
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
going to fix the whole problem but it's
 
00:42:16.829 --> 00:42:16.839 align:start position:0%
going to fix a lot of it your secret
 
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
secret indictment program is a joke is a
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%

00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
where the public and the community
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%

I'm sorry I'm so so sorry to tell you
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
that um another thing that I want to say
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
was uh you know I feel bad for the
 
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
addicts I come I come from a family of
 
00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.230 align:start position:0%
addicts I come I come from a family of
drug

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
drug
 
00:43:36.549 --> 00:43:36.559 align:start position:0%
addicts but we could write legislation
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
in this in this state and I guarantee
 
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
you other states will follow we could
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
write legislation in this state just
 
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
like Robert Blakeley wrote the RICO
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
statue we could write a statue in this
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
state that applies to uh uh opiate
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
dealers and we give them and and and
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
those opiate dealers we bury them in the
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
jail oh how do we how do we sort out
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
who's an opiate dealer and who was a
 
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:01.559 align:start position:0%
poor addict that was getting somebody
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
from somebody for somebody else so that
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
they very easy very simple to
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
do in the booking process when they are
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
arrested for sales of we we we we write
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
legislation we we we make this law okay
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
that applies to drug dealers not drug
 
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
addicts drug dealers how we decide for
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
the two well one we can tell by just
 
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
looking at them number one but that's
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
not a good way to do anything this we
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
have we need
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
confirmation so how we get confirmation

education I I think my highest grade
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
completed was sixth
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%

addicts and um the addicts we need to
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
start treating them like addicts give
 
00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
them an alternative to incarcerations
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
give them empowerment so they could
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
build themselves up from the inside
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%

people um I hate to say this but a lot
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%

minimum mandatories and that's that's
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%

next to die from from an overdose from
 
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
that very same drug dealer that came
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts or New York or New
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%

00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
lot of drug dealers coming from other
 
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
areas there's a lot of drug dealers that
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
come from other states you know and they
 
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
come here to do exactly that because
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
that's just it you know if if if they
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
can spend $5,000 in their state in the
 
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
state they live in and they're only
 
00:49:14.789 --> 00:49:14.799 align:start position:0%
going to make
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
$10,000 they'll do it but if they're
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
going to spend $5,000 on drugs in their
 
00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
state and bring it to New Hampshire and
 
00:49:20.599 --> 00:49:22.390 align:start position:0%
state and bring it to New Hampshire and
make

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
$50,000 they're running to this border
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
they're running here the they're going
 
00:49:28.789 --> 00:49:28.799 align:start position:0%
right to Manchester Manchester's the
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
Manchester's The Hub okay and then from
 
00:49:32.789 --> 00:49:32.799 align:start position:0%

there or in Dover over there over here
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
and then they start to spread
 
00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
out but your drugs ultimately come and
 
00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:46.799 align:start position:0%
they hit that when they come up here
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
they hit Manchester Prim number one and
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
or the Portsmouth area because 95 comes
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
up that
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
watched the news a lot which I shouldn't
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
and and and and I'm involved in the
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
community a lot which which I'm trying
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
to change it but I'm one person it's
 
00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
like I'm fighting a monster with
 
00:50:59.549 --> 00:50:59.559 align:start position:0%
multiple heads the minute I I'm gain I
 
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
think I'm gaining speed or something
 
00:51:03.069 --> 00:51:03.079 align:start position:0%
it's like five heads come on and bite me
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
everywhere so what I mean by that is
 
00:51:07.789 --> 00:51:07.799 align:start position:0%
like I see crimes going
 
00:51:07.799 --> 00:51:09.870 align:start position:0%
like I see crimes going
on

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
and uh the person that commits the crime
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
is out within two hours three
 
00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
hours and later on that night or the
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
very next day getting arrested for the
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
very same
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
thing you know and it takes three or
 
00:51:26.789 --> 00:51:26.799 align:start position:0%
four times before they before somebody
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
before the prosecutor tells the judge
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
hey uh you know uh why don't we do a
 
00:51:30.599 --> 00:51:32.470 align:start position:0%
hey uh you know uh why don't we do a
preventative

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
preventative
 
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
detention preventative detention I've
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
never even heard of that that's a joke
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's give him bail or no bail
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
period you know
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh just I just feel
 
00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
that you could do a lot better
 
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
especially with the with the you want to
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
drive the drug dealers out get rid of
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
get rid of your secret and diment
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
program get rid of that and do TNT
 
00:51:58.990 --> 00:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
technical narcotics task force buy and
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
bust operations in broad daylight where
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
everyone can see it you're going to send
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
a public I mean going to send a message
 
00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:08.839 align:start position:0%
to the public you're gonna you you I I
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
believe I believe it's only my
 
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
perception of this if the community
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
starts to see this it will build it'll
 
00:52:16.109 --> 00:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
build a closer relationship with the
 
00:52:16.119 --> 00:52:17.430 align:start position:0%
build a closer relationship with the
police

00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
department because out of sight out of
 
00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:20.839 align:start position:0%
mind the cops don't care they're not
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
doing anything the people that sell
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
drugs they're all they but if you're
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
doing it in Broad daylight in the
 
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
community seeing this I I think it
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
restores a little bit of Hope in them
 
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
that you guys are cleaning up the
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
community and stuff like that I live in
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
these communities that's what it would
 
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
do to me if I saw that so living in that
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
community and I ask a lot of people if
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
you if you saw them coming out with the
 
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
jumping out grabbing everybody who sold
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
the drugs bro they like would that
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
restore your faith a little bit and I
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I get a smile a lot I think it would
 
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
yeah it would I would love to see them
 
00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
do that it always brings a smile from
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
somebody I've never once seen somebody
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
unless they're a drug dealer which I
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
don't ask them they'll be like no way I
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
don't want to see that but everybody who
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
is a citizen that lives around the unry
 
00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:09.799 align:start position:0%
area who doesn't involve themselves in
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%

um yeah I really thank everybody for
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
bringing me here letting me say what I
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
needed to say like I said um there was
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
there was a time in my life I would
 
00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
never speak this way I would never speak
 
00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
speak this way there was a time in my
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
life but you know again I was taught the
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
wrong things growing up as a kid so I
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
had to undo all of
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
that and I did a little bit late but I
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
guess late is better than ever and today
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
um thank God you know I don't I don't I
 
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
don't even dream about that life style I
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
have a small business I do a lot of work
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
we take out we K keep kids safe from
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
from let paint
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
poisoning and that's what I focus on you
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
know and I try to keep I don't even help
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
people detox anymore because I lost hope
 
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
so now my all my all my energy goes on
 
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
trying to save the kids there's a
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
there's a nice program in Manchester
 
00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
called my turn and I try to reach out to
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
those kids there crime deterrence and
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
prevention I got a guy who's a
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
professional boxer he's going to start
 
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
training the kids in there burn up some
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
steam or whatever and just you know but
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
back to minimum
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
mandatories uh uh TNT buy and bust
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
operations and uh and uh bail reform I
 
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
think we need to need to look at that as
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
a government body you guys need to look
 
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
at that Democrat Republican independent
 
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter get together all of you
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
guys get together as a team and and and
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
and turn this whole thing around not
 
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
just for you guys but for all of us for
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
everybody you know we're all one person
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
away from addiction period one person
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
and before it takes somebody that you
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
care about let's try maybe it already
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
did maybe I'm speaking but you know
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
let's try to tighten up tighten up that
 
00:55:32.349 --> 00:55:32.359 align:start position:0%
knot and get the drug dealers and lock
 
00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
them up
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you U any questions from the
 
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
committee for this witness
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative Stone thank you from your
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
experience in seeing people on the
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
streets using narcotics the low-level
 
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
street level dealer in attic are they
 
00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
safer on the inside or are they safer
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
incarcerated the low level addicts again
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
low-level addicts need they they don't
 
00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
need to be in prisoned they need an
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
alternative to incarceration in my
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
opinion because
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
so here's what they say they say that
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
and it's proven through science you know
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
so they say that people who do these do
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
this heroin and all that
 
00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
stuff you know people are broken and I
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
guess when they everybody's broken to a
 
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
certain degree I guess that when they
 
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
take that substance it it fills that
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
void it makes them feel happy and
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
everything's okay and so that's what
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
they get stuck on that
 
00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
feeling but before long they have and
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
I'm preaching to the choir you guys know
 
00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
this before long they have a two
 
00:56:45.309 --> 00:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
problems now now you're chasing The
 
00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
Happy Feeling that you got the first
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
time you did it and now you got a
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
physical dependency three days four days
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
later so I think they need they need
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
they need uh alternative to
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
incarceration not to be with a 10year
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
minimum mandatory that does that's that
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be fair to them because they
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
are suffering they're trapped in
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
addiction and they need uh Alterna to
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
incarceration need mental health
 
00:57:10.589 --> 00:57:10.599 align:start position:0%
services and stuff like that because
 
00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of that comes from mental
 
00:57:14.109 --> 00:57:14.119 align:start position:0%
health too being broken inside I'm
 
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
broken inside I know and
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
um mental health they need alternative
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
to incarceration the ones that need the
 
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
minimum mandatories are the ones who pee
 
00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:26.119 align:start position:0%
in that cup in their booking process and
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
they don't give you a positive for any
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
um uh uh opiates because those are the
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
true ones the ones that don't give you
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
a positive piss test for opiates those
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
are the true dealers those are the ones
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
that are taking the money buying houses
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
Mercedes-Benz this that those are the
 
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
real that's the that's the real enemy
 
00:57:47.069 --> 00:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
right there that's the real enemy and
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
those are the real I don't want to use
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
that word Killers I don't know but those
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are really people are
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
dying left and right it's de it's their
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
problem it's their fault you know uh I
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
could get bigger than that bigger than
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
therefore I could go to a government
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
level you know attack the cartels right
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
but we're not we're not we're not
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
government right over there in DC we're
 
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
here in
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
mamire but um the ones who are not
 
00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
giving you a positive urine test at the
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
time of arrest for opiates then you
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
don't then then then you will trigger
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
the new law or the new statute that we
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
write that we will give minimum
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
mandatories to anybody selling vetor
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
anything that has to do with OPI I don't
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
care bury him in the jail and you'll see
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
within a few years you'll see a
 
00:58:38.599 --> 00:58:40.789 align:start position:0%
within a few years you'll see a
decline

00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
decline
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
guaranteed what is the um what is the
 
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
most common drug if you're aware of
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's currently going around Manchester
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
f um we've heard that there's other some
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
kind of other drug that's causing people
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
to break out in sores it's a Well is
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's it's fanol and then
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
then then they have it's Fentanyl and
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
then the the
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine so I think what's
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
breaking making them break out and
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
everything is that methan fenine because
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
when they cook it over there in Mexico I
 
00:59:09.549 --> 00:59:09.559 align:start position:0%
watch documentaries on this stuff all
 
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
the time and I'm not a pro I'm not a pro
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
but I just what I know they cook it over
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
there in these 55 gallon drums in Mexico
 
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
and they wear you should see them they
 
00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
wear these T they got documentaries on
 
00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
this stuff they wear these tyvex suits
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
and full face mask with and and some of
 
00:59:28.829 --> 00:59:28.839 align:start position:0%
them even wear um provided oxygen and
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
they mixing it in these big and they're
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
mixing all these chemicals so these
 
00:59:38.829 --> 00:59:38.839 align:start position:0%
chemicals putting it into the body so I
 
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
think that's what's causing that but
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not like crocodile or any
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
of that stuff that's was no it's not
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
that that's not on the streets what's
 
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
out there is mostly fentanyl because
 
00:59:52.829 --> 00:59:52.839 align:start position:0%
they did away what happened
 
00:59:58.589 --> 00:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
was so heroin back way back in the 80s
 
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
you can take one kilo of heroin and cut
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
it with 10 kilos of
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
heroin it started to decline over the
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
years decline decline decline decline
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
decline until until it got to a point
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
where you couldn't even cut it no more
 
01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
the heroin they can't cut it no more um
 
01:00:18.029 --> 01:00:18.039 align:start position:0%
because they'll make it weak so some
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
brilliant some I don't know who got the
 
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
brilliant idea to Purdue farmer I blame
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
too to come up with a
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
fentor fentor was designed originally
 
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
for a patch for cancer patients some
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
smart guy took it and put it in a white
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
powder and
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
so 50 times stronger 100 times stronger
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
than heroin yeah nobody don't want the
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
heroin no more now they want the fat no
 
01:00:44.109 --> 01:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
and it's cheaper than
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
heroin and but but but I'm hearing that
 
01:00:49.029 --> 01:00:49.039 align:start position:0%
they also starting
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
to lace
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
marijuana with um
 
01:00:59.950 --> 01:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
VOR out there that's a problem that's a
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
big problem because you're going to
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
they're GNA these these they're going to
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
take guys who never even did opiates are
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
you going to give okay they shouldn't be
 
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
smoking marijana but they do and they're
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
going to have a opiate problem before
 
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
they know it and not even realize that
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
they have a problem but that is the main
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
drug is is is is is the meth the meth
 
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
and the fany that's the main things did
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
you have a question yes thank you I if I
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
can Mr chairman I have like a
 
01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
three-point question we're working on
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
bail reform and um it's it's very
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
complex but my question is one of the
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
bills that we're working on um is uh
 
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
regarding you know testing drugs do in
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
your experience um do addicts take the
 
01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:51.039 align:start position:0%
time to test their drugs for f thank you
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
how much they also we also considering
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
um legalizing um um minuscule amounts of
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
narcotic to to transport to a center to
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
test and they're talking about a 20
 
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
milligram so if an addict purchases
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
their drugs um brings it to a center to
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
test it for fentanyl you're not seeing
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
that in real life it's not going to
 
01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
happen and thank you and my last
 
01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
question is um do you feel that if we
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
close the borders we'll decrease the
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
amount of drug absolutely thank you the
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
second question uh the last question is
 
01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:30.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely 1,00% the other two questions
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
the first two questions goes to this I'm
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
deeply sorry to inform you this but I'm
 
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
sorry you're wasting your time doing
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
that you really are you're going to be
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
wasting everybody's time and breath and
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
energies talking about trying to get
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
them to go They're not going to do that
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
and and not only that here's the other
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
problem I believe you're if you do that
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
you're going to enable them you're going
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
to make the problem worse by doing that
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
because at that point you're telling
 
01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
them okay goad go get high just don't
 
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
o go steal just don't o you're going to
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
make the problem worse if you start
 
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
doing if you start to cater to the drug
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
dealer to as far as if we're going to
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
cater them we're going to cater to them
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
to get them off the drugs and give them
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
an alternative to incarceration or you
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
go to jail end the story do it on your
 
01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
own or we'll help you do it
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
but if you start to cater to them trust
 
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
me listen to what I'm telling you please
 
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
you have to believe me when I'm telling
 
01:03:33.269 --> 01:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
you this I beg you I'll get on my knes
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
if you want me to I beg you I come from
 
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
a lowincome area my whole life I've been
 
01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
involved I Chang I got I went away in
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
2001 I came out 2011 and I've changed my
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
life but before that I was deeply
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
embedded in the street life I was a pro
 
01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.990 align:start position:0%
embedded in the street life I was a pro
drug

01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
drug
 
01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
dealer I had an federal investigation
 
01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
here one time and I shake the feds I am
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
smart I know how to do this if I was if
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
I was I would never do that but let's
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
just say if I went back to drug dealing
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
I would never get
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
arrested that's and I'm saying this
 
01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
because I want you to understand the
 
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
magnitude of how that I know what I'm
 
01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
saying if you start to entertain the
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
thought of in of of letting them indulge
 
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
in drugs you're going to make the
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
problem worse facts that is a fact you
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
will thank you representative um Harry
 
01:04:27.309 --> 01:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
gther oh oh represent wheeler I'm sorry
 
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr Lopez
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
for your enthusiastic testimony um I
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
know the life that you're talking about
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
more than I think you understand and I I
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
guess my question would be when you're
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
talking about um trying to instill
 
01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
instill this fear in people who are
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
selling drugs
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
um is that worth the mandatory minimum
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh sweeping up the people who are not
 
01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily the cartel drug dealers I
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
mean when we're talking about and let me
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
just finish my question here when we're
 
01:05:08.109 --> 01:05:08.119 align:start position:0%
talking about the cartels Purdue
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
Pharma The Entity that Fels coming from
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
I mean these are large entities with a
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
lot of money and are picking up their
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
street level dealers and putting them in
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
jail for 10 years is that necessarily
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
going to stop that industry and then is
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
that worth
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
picking up the people who aren't a part
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
of that industry who have just gotten in
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
such a bad way that they're now on the
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
street dealing drugs and now are in
 
01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
prison for 10 years is that Culture of
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
Fear uh necess well a number one is that
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
going to actually stop this problem of
 
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
this uh I mean what is Evil coming from
 
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
this very well-funded Force being put
 
01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:53.559 align:start position:0%
out on our streets I don't think so but
 
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear hear what you think
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
about that and then B is it worth the
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
culture of fear and potentially picking
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
up people who aren't a part of that and
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
have just found themselves in a bad way
 
01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
like yourself who uh given the right
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
opportunities in prison or out of it may
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
find themselves in a different and more
 
01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.910 align:start position:0%
find themselves in a different and more
better

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
place absolutely it
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
work the first answer to your question
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
is yes we can't go after the cartels we
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
can't do nothing on a federal level DC
 
01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
level but I'm not worried about that I'm
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
not worried about them worried about
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
this state and as a state yes it does
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
work because
 
01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
there's 50 more 49 more if you take and
 
01:06:40.109 --> 01:06:40.119 align:start position:0%
you lock lock it up in this state you
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
sew up this state you will deter drug
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
dealers from coming to this state to
 
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
sell drugs the way they don't like going
 
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
to main so if you have if you're
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
familiar with that which I think you I
 
01:06:54.029 --> 01:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
think you are probably I think you are
 
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
are if you're familiar with that and you
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
have family that you know from that
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
life then you would know a lot of people
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
don't go to main for that reason they
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
don't go to main you go you got to be
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
crazy to go to Main and minimum
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
mandatories do
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
work um it was it was some it was a
 
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
certain group in local government and or
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%

goddamn right put them in jail minimum
 
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
mandatories 10 years that will work and
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
as far as the addicts like I said the
 
01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
addicts don't deserve the 10 years the
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
addicts deserve help the ones who
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
deserve the 10 years are the ones that
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
are out there trying to be the
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
baller the
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
baller selling in kilos and this and
 
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
buying a kilo then doing that buying
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
houses in Dominican Republic buying
 
01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
houses in Puerto Rico or buying a
 
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
mercedesbenz buying $3,000 gold chains
 
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that I'm talking
 
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
about that need to be put underneath the
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
jail you know
 
01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.230 align:start position:0%
jail you know
and

01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:17.309 --> 01:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm glad you said that you know
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
because because yeah I don't I'm not
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about it on a federal level
 
01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not concerned about the cartels
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
DC got to worry about them Washington
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know you you know who uh
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
um Lindsey Graham and his crew they
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
worry about them they got a bill right
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
now they trying to they trying to
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
designate them as for terrorist
 
01:08:41.789 --> 01:08:41.799 align:start position:0%
terrorist groups and if they do they're
 
01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
going to go into Mexico and they're
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
going to kick
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
ass so we can't do that here I'm talking
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
about what we could do here on the state
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
level see what I'm saying so that's why
 
01:08:57.789 --> 01:08:57.799 align:start position:0%

01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
farum center and at one time the farum
 
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
center people would wait three weeks
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
before they get a bed space and people
 
01:13:17.709 --> 01:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
were dying left and right and so I felt
 
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
I had to do something about it and
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
that's when I had the detox place and
 
01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
stuff like in my own garage and stuff
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
and there was another I don't want to
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
say his name but he was another he was
 
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:31.400 align:start position:0%

01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%

01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
me no if somebody dies there you could
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
be brought up on charges you're not
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%

01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%

01:17:45.629 --> 01:17:45.639 align:start position:0%

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
Abby coet Manchester
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
PD Abby coet Abby coet Manchester PD
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
she is phenomenal one
 
01:17:59.070 --> 01:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
day on Bridge
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
Street this is why I say this there was
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
there was fire fire fire crew was there
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
and ambulance was there
 
01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
and OD that's what comes to my head
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
right away and I like to keep the
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
statistic I like to wait what happened o
 
01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
anyway so I went to Abby coet and I went
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
up to
 
01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
her and I said hey can I get a minute
 
01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
with you
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
sure they said what happened here is
 
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
this is this like an old or something
 
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
she took the time instead of telling me
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
this is we're doing go over there like
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
most police do go over there go over
 
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
there she took the time and she
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
explained it to me she couldn't explain
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
it all in one breath and told me hold on
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
wait a minute if you want to know more
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
just go over there I'll get back to you
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
and I did that to see if she would have
 
01:18:50.629 --> 01:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
got back to me just uh because another
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
thing that's important is police and the
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%

questions that she could that she could
answer

01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%

experience what what I know would work
 
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
in these communities these low-income
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
communities because this is where I grew
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
up my entire
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
life this is where I grew up my entire
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
life if you take me if she took me to to
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
her let's just for example let's just
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
just just make pretend okay she has a
 
01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:01.470 align:start position:0%
just just make pretend okay she has a
beautiful

01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
beautiful
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
home beautiful and suburbia like if she
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
took me up there I'd be dumb I wouldn't
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
know what to
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
do because I've never lived that I don't
 
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
know if I'm making sense but I've never
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
lived that life I would be
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
lost so it's those very same people you
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
can't fix my world you can I'm sorry I
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
don't mean to be I don't mean to be I'm
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
not I'm not being rude and I'm not being
 
01:22:31.149 --> 01:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
cocky or I'm not being anything we're
 
01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
being we're speaking Logics these are
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
facts you can't you can't solve my you
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
can't solve these problems you need you
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
need people from this community from
 
01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
this side of the
 
01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:45.639 align:start position:0%
tracks you're you guys you guys are the
 
01:22:46.990 --> 01:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
you guys are the people who sit at the
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
throne that can make the
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
changes with the input from these people
 
01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:55.149 align:start position:0%
changes with the input from these people
here

01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
make sense you can make the changes you
 
01:22:59.790 --> 01:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
have the power to make the changes but
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
you need the input from the people from
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
this side of the tracks and and again
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say one more time drug
 
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
dealers if you are selling drugs in this
 
01:23:13.149 --> 01:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
state and you are a Cold Stone
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
coldhearted drug dealer not an addict
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't care if you do cocaine and
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
smoke weed you're not an addict in my
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
opinion you're not an addict you got to
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
be a
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
every you got to be an opiate
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
addict write legislation just like
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
Robert Bley wrote the RICO law you apply
 
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
this I'll help you I'll write it for you
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
in my own language you can put it in
 
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
legislative languages I'll do it for you
 
01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
put it and it applies to drug dealers
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
and drug dealers only it's the same
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
thing Robert Blakeley did to Target the
 
01:23:47.229 --> 01:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
mafia why we can't do the same statue to
 
01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
Target drug dealers why what's so hard
 
01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
about that it's not hard it's easy let's
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
get together let's get in a room let's
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
write legislation put it on the floor
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
