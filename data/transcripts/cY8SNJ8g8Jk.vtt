00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
reading representative cran about
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
someone named Grady crean who is
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
apparently quite a good hockey player
 
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
any uh
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
relation I do not know quite possibly I
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
know um it was a large you know large
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
French Canadian family um many years ago
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
but yeah I don't know if we're related
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
to him I know we're related to the uh
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
former prime minister of Canada a few
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
Generations back he's apparently a high
 
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
school hockey player in Manchester oh
 
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
then quite
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
possibly most likely but I don't know
 
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for sorry satisfying my
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
curiosity about that
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay so now is the time to uh turn the
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair uh because of
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
the length of time we have today and the
 
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
number of people speaking we will be
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
limiting uh speakers times strictly to 2
 
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
minutes each
 
00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:31.959 align:start position:0%
uh with the exception of the primary
 
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor which will which will be given
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
five minutes so with that being said I
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
would like to introduce representative
 
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
549 thank you Mr chairman and good
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
morning committee
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
members over the last uh several weeks
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
we've had something like three to four
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
hours of testimony Andor
 
00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
discussion about bills that concern
 
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and the system
 
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.870 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and the system
benefits

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
charge and listening to those
 
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
discussions two themes have become very
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
apparent one that rate paay funded
 
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency has many benefits for
 
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:20.839 align:start position:0%
citizens of our
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
state and two that managing the savings
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
targets and the money spent on rate
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
payer funded Energy Efficiency is a
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
pretty complicated
 
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
activity now I've spent quite a few
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
years as a state legislator struggling
 
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
with how to balance the need for Energy
 
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
Efficiency which we all agree is a a
 
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.230 align:start position:0%
Efficiency which we all agree is a a
substantial

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
need with a transparent and accountable
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
process for paying for that Energy
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and over those four years
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's come apparent to me that we
 
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
need some kind of a fundamental change
 
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
in how we're doing all
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
this so this morning I'm going to
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
request that the committee repa retain
 
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
549 so that we
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
can explore the possibility of a new way
 
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
of doing Energy
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
Efficiency rate payer funded Energy
 
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and paying for
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
it when I filed this bill so back in uh
 
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
the fall my original intent was mostly
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
to put this eers into statute because I
 
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
know from past discussions that a lot of
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
people were afraid that the legislature
 
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
was trying to kill the
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
eers well that was never my intent I
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody else in the
 
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
legislature had that intent either so I
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
thought well one way to assuage people's
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
fears about that would be to put the e
 
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
even the consumer
 
00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
Advocate has admitted that ERS is an
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
invention of the Public Utilities
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
Commission and that putting it in
 
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
statute statute would be an appropriate
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
useful step for the general court to
 
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.389 align:start position:0%
useful step for the general court to
take

00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
hello yes
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
hello I can't hear
 
00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
V you can't hear what you he can't she
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
can't hear
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
you can anybody else hear me yeah I can
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
hear both uh Michael and
 
00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
Jackie Jackie it must be something on
 
00:12:35.079 --> 00:12:36.350 align:start position:0%
Jackie Jackie it must be something on
your

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
Jackie we did hear you but can you hear
 
00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:48.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.069 --> 00:12:51.079 align:start position:0%
speak can you Jackie can you raise your
 
00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
Jennifer is there anything you can do to
 
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
help her or I would just suggest um a
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
making sure that your speakers are
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
turned up and B if they are but you're
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
still not hearing anything I would just
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
try disconnecting and reconnecting
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's enough to um get things
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
sorted out you'll need a phone call to
 
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
have her to have the S her
 
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
right Peter can you help her uh
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
okay jennif Jennifer you were suggesting
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
that she reboot her computer is that it
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
or really she may just need to
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
disconnect from the meeting and
 
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
reconnect sometimes that will fix up any
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
connection problems it looks like she's
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
doing that because she's gone from the
 
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
AUD you got turn the audio there she is
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
hello well I hate to I hesitate to hold
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
up the hearing any longer because we
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
have 13 people who have signed up to
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
speak so let me just continue on while
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
Peter works with Jackie to try to get
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
resolved so to pick up where I left
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
off people were afraid that legislative
 
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
office side of the SBC would neuter or
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
E therefore putting the erer into law
 
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
under pu control seems to me to be a
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
good way to reassure Energy Efficiency
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
Advocates that
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
protected

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
protected
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
now the EC the
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
SBC is probably the most problematic
 
00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
piece of this Energy Efficiency puzzle
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
the SBC was also more of a creation of
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
the P than the legislature while its
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
existence was allowed under statute it
 
00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
was never clearly defined as to its
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
purpose or
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
use the language of RSA
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
374f col4 says quote a non- bypassable
 
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
and competitively neutral system
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
benefits charge applied to the use of
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
the distribution system may be used to
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
fund public benefits related to the
 
00:15:36.509 --> 00:15:36.519 align:start position:0%
provision of electricity unquote then it
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
goes on to say that Energy Efficiency
 
00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
benefits but the sbc's public
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
benefits are described in statute as
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
being to regarding the provision
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
electricity your
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
meeting however the commission
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
interpreted that restriction broadly to
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
include all types of Energy
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
Efficiency including what most people
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
would categorize is thermal energy
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
efficiency and that broad definition
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
introduced some ambigu ambiguity into
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
the understanding of what the SBC was by
 
00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:17.910 align:start position:0%
the understanding of what the SBC was by
the

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
public furthermore some people have
 
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
characterized the SBC as a user fee but
 
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:26.839 align:start position:0%
Ray payers who never use the service
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
must still pay the fee
 
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
now that odd definition of a user fee
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
made the SBC look more like a deao tax
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
than a fee and that confusion led to
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
many led many people to interpret that
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
the SBC is a pseudo tax and should be
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
under legislative control well when you
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
take all this together we have a very
 
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
confusing situation and this morning I'm
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
going to propose that
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
we maybe take a different approach
 
00:17:02.309 --> 00:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
maybe the best way to do this is to
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
create a revolving fund on Energy
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
Efficiency trust fund if you will that
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
would be funded by the system benefits
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
charge in the ldac for three to five
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
years until it
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
accumulated a sum of money such as $500
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
million or so at which point the SBC and
 
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
the ldac could be
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
eliminated which would save taxpayers I
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
mean R payers hundreds of millions of
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
dollars in the future
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
without jeopardizing the ability to do
 
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency so I ask uh this
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
morning that the
 
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
committee retain HB
 
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
549 so that we can work to investigate
 
00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
this approach to Energy
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
Efficiency funding and with that I'll
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
take questions and ask people to be
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
brief because we have for 13 other
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
speak representative McGee your hands up
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
for a question I hope yes thank you Mr
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
Vice chair uh and thank you for taking
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
my question question chairman Vose um
 
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
you said in your testimony that many
 
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
people were confused and that the
 
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
process needed transparency and
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
accountability and I've been involved in
 
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
some processes over at the Pu and I
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
guess my question is since their process
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
is public and transparent and they have
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
to have proofs in terms of the benefit
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
to the rate payers how do we get a
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
better process for transparency or
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
accountability when it's currently an
 
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process where they have to
 
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
actually prove that it's of benefit to
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
people um to have it work the way that
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
it does
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGee for that
 
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
question if you walk out under the
 
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
streets of Hollis and uh ask your
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
neighbors what they know about the
 
00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
system benefits charge and the
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
E what kind of answers you think you'll
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
get a lot of government I would think
 
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
answer that rhetorical question by
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
saying that most people have won't have
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
a clue about what either the SBC or the
 
00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
eers is the adjudicative process is
 
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
great for
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
involving uh the cogniz eny of energy
 
00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
policy but it does nothing to help the
 
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
average person understand what these um
 
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
what these programs are all about and
 
00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:48.039 align:start position:0%
yet they're the people who are asked to
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
pay for these programs so I would argue
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
that they're not as transparent and
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
accountable as they may appear on the
 
00:19:55.799 --> 00:20:00.510 align:start position:0%
accountable as they may appear on the
surface

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative uh oxam
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you sir uh yes
 
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
representative both I'm a little
 
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
bewildered as to how this money is going
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
to be accumulated in a fund over the
 
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:17.559 align:start position:0%
next two to three three to five excuse
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
me three to five years and at the same
 
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
time the money should be available for
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
those cities firms residents who want to
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
access the funds to do Energy Efficiency
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
projects me it's kind of seems like
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
having your cake and eating it too could
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
you explain that for
 
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
me sure thank you for the question
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
representative so as I indicated in my
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
written testimony there needs to be a
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
fairly complex and multi-tiered approach
 
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
to making this work it may require for
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
example that uh Energy
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
Efficiency funding may have to come from
 
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
a different Source while the Energy
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
Efficiency trust fund is
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
sufficiently U populated with SBC and
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
ldac funds to become operational and so
 
00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
the devil is always in the details right
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
we have to work out the details of how
 
00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
to make this happen but it can be done
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh revolving trust funds are commonly
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
used in in government for a variety of
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
of different functions and we just need
 
00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:30.039 align:start position:0%
time to fixure fure out the exact
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
methodology for making it happen do I
 
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
know all the answers right now no but
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm asking the committee to
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:45.470 align:start position:0%
bill okay representative man for a
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.549 align:start position:0%
bill okay representative man for a
[Music]

00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
unmute I'm sorry I I don't have a
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
question I had a comment
 
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
so I will what stop I will stop right
 
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
you seeing seeing no other hands we're
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
going to move on to the next speaker
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
before we go on to the next speaker I
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
would like to give a a little bit of
 
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
advice please with the amount of time we
 
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
have which is short you can make your
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
your most bang for the buck each speaker
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
by dispensing with any frivolous
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
information and go right to your point
 
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
please because then it takes a long time
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
takes at least 30 seconds to say who you
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
are where you're from uh blah blah blah
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
all all of that so just go right to your
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
point we have your information down here
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
written we we'd appreciate that and it
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
helps you out too so thank you with that
 
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
said our next speaker is Mr Don CH the
 
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
OCA Mr CH you are
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
on thank you and uh good morning
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
everybody uh good morning chairman Vose
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
Vice chairman Thomas ranking member
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
ssuch members of the committee I'm not
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
going to take up too much of your time
 
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
uh because I agree with almost
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
everything that I heard the
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
distinguished chairman say uh uh in
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
particular although he and I I think
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
come from maybe different points on the
 
00:23:20.269 --> 00:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
Spectrum when it comes to uh reverence
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
for or enthusiasm about rate payer
 
00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
funded Energy Efficiency I I think that
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
there is a way to meet the concerns of
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
the Skeptics in trying the Energy
 
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
Efficiency resource standard in statute
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
and create a legal and Regulatory
 
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
scenario in uh with which everybody will
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
be more or less comfortable uh because
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
there'll be sufficient accountability
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
there'll be sufficient legislative
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
guidance to the puc and to the utilities
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
that run our
 
00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:53.799 align:start position:0%
programs and sufficient constraints on
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
near-term spending so that everybody's
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
electric bills will be uh closer to to
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
where uh they would like them to be so
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
if you read my or if you saw my written
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
testimony you saw that chairman Vose is
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
suggesting that you do exactly what I
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
suggested you do which is retain the
 
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
bill I am excited uh uh about helping
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
the committee as much as I can uh
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
redraft the bill so that it meets um all
 
00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:20.919 align:start position:0%
of these needs because I think these
 
00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:23.799 align:start position:0%
things are very uh doable from my
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
standpoint as an Energy Efficiency
 
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
Enthusiast uh the only thing I heard
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
chairman V say that I didn't agree with
 
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
was his suggestion that adjudication at
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
the Pu is not helpful when it comes to
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
accountability because it doesn't help
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
the average person it only helps the
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
cognis Senti uh my rebuttal to that
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
would be I'm one of the cognic Senti and
 
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
my job is to represent the average
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
person and I think the reason my office
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
exists is that there's a legislative
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement that the average person
 
00:24:56.669 --> 00:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the time to participate in
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
pu adjudicative proceedings so I do and
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
I try to do a decent job of keeping the
 
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
interests of the uh average person in
 
00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:06.039 align:start position:0%
mind so I think I'll stop there and just
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
say uh I'm eager to work with the
 
00:25:09.789 --> 00:25:09.799 align:start position:0%
committee as it labors through what I
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
hope will end up being a retained bill
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
and I have a lot of optimism that we
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
will get to a place that more or less
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
everybody could be comfortable with
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you m thank you Mr CH I see a hand
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
up from representative oxam you're up
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much and thank
 
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr Creer taking my question um you
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
stated that you agreed with almost
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
everything that the chairman had stated
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to ask about this
 
00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:42.919 align:start position:0%
particular one uh the chairman stated
 
00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
that some call it a user fee but folks
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
who never use the surface are paying for
 
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
it is that your understanding of how the
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
system benefit charge
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
Works um I agree with chairman Vose that
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
some people do call the system benefits
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
charge or think of the system benefits
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
charge as a user fee that that is not
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
the way I see the at least the Energy
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
Efficiency portion of the SBC I think
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
basically it is like the other charges
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
on your bill a charge that you pay for a
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
service that you receive and everybody
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
receives that service because everybody
 
00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:23.799 align:start position:0%
benefits from cost-effective Energy
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
Efficiency not just the people who
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
happen to have the Savvy or the uh
 
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to participate directly in
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency programs so I I
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
hope representative oxam that that is
 
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
responsive to your question yes it is
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you repr representative
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
question uh yes thank thank you uh Mr
 
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
chairman for taking this question thank
 
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
you uh uh Mr GRE um I wanted to ask you
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
um are you an a how do you feel about
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
the idea of the SBC charge being set by
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh the general court instead of by the
 
00:27:12.669 --> 00:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
Pu well as I said in my written
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
testimony and as I previously said about
 
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh house bill I forget the bill number
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
uh I I do not think that the general
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
court should be setting rates
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
essentially ever and as my written
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
testimony pointed out it's not because
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
you lack the expertise you probably have
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
you have at least as much expertise on
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
this committee as the Public Utilities
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
Commission has but what you don't have
 
00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:40.039 align:start position:0%
is the time or the right process in
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
place to do this right uh and again as I
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
said in my written testimony the uh
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
filing that the utilities made at the
 
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
beginning of September uh their
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
three-year Energy Efficiency plan is
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
almost a thousand pages long uh and if I
 
00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
was in the hearing room with you uh in
 
00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
person I would have brought it in and it
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
down on the witness table and said look
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
at this I mean most of this is
 
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and detailed technical
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
information that I'm hardpressed to
 
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
understand and I do have the time so uh
 
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
so my short answer to your question
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative samich is I I believe
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
strongly that uh the general court
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing rates and that
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
perspective is less about me as the rate
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
payer Advocate and more uh about me as
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
the former general counsel of the Pu UC
 
00:28:30.509 --> 00:28:30.519 align:start position:0%
and former law professor who used to
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
teach administrative law I'm very
 
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about the issues that arise
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
around legislative delegation and I
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
think we're all best served when the
 
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
legislature offers up clear guidance and
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
then delegates certain tasks to uh
 
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
administrative agencies like the Pu and
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
setting rates is a classic example of
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
when delegation is
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you sorry for such a
 
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.230 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you sorry for such a
long-winded

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
long-winded
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%

ke
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
there yeah Don is read I I am here I
 
00:31:45.149 --> 00:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
would you like to testify um just for a
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
moment I mean I sent in the written
 
00:31:51.149 --> 00:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
testimony that you can read um and I
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
again I wasn't prepared for the decision
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
today so um uh dear representative V and
 
00:31:59.710 --> 00:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the st&amp; committee I
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
am writing an opposition to House Bill
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
549 um just a couple quick reasons um
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
the first one is it's well accepted that
 
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency is usually the least
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
expensive source of energy at all and I
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
think it sounds like you agree with that
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
this bill will strip New Hampshire saves
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
of much of its authority to offer the
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
rebates for weathering weatherizing your
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
home only homes with electric heat is my
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
understanding would be weatherized homes
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
heated by oil propan would no longer for
 
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
the rebates this change fails to
 
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
recognize that weather weatherizing a
 
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
home does actually save electricity
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
insulation keeps a home warmer in the
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
winter and cooler in the summer anyone
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
who runs an air conditioner or fans for
 
00:32:45.789 --> 00:32:45.799 align:start position:0%
cooling knows they use a lot of
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
electricity which costs more money and
 
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
it puts a huge demand on the power grid
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
in the summertime both are big reasons
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
for keeping weatherization programs
 
00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
available especially for lowincome
 
00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.669 align:start position:0%
available especially for lowincome
residents

00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
residents
 
00:32:58.679 --> 00:32:59.470 align:start position:0%
residents
one

00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
minute at least 10 of the 11 Mayors and
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
their communities support the 100%
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
renewable energy goal uh by 2050
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs are an integral
 
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
part of that program for example
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
conquered is one of the communities that
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
adopted that uh renewable energy goal
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
the conquer's en environment energy
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
climate advisory committee had planned
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
in April of 2020 to rule out a program
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
promoting a Citywide effort to
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
weatherize more homes focused in on
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
lowincome households because of the
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic it's been postponed it's still
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
planned but been postponed that bill
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
would stop the financial support in the
 
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
rebates so that's the big reason that I
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
one of the big reasons that I support it
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
clean energy is our future and it's
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
under attack in New Hampshire not only
 
00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire behind in New England
 
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
but in the country and I think this
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
would put us even more behind so I was
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
asking you to please vote no thank you
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you Mr thank you for
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
keeping it under two
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no questions thank you
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
for your testimony we'll move on to Mr
 
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.510 align:start position:0%
for your testimony we'll move on to Mr
Peter

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
Peter
 
00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:15.079 align:start position:0%
Hansel you're on for two minutes and um
 
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
please just summarize thank you for uh
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak um I'll try to keep
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
my my my comments brief they're similar
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
to the previous speaker I am a chair of
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
the Keen energy climate committee which
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
is tasked with uh implementing our
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
energy plan which was just passed by our
 
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
city council in January uh we have the
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
same objectives of 100% energy renewable
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
energy uh over the next several decades
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
one of the key components of that is
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
reducing energy use uh it doesn't matter
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
how uh how much energy you turn to
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
renewable if you're consuming way too
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
much en in the first place so anything
 
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
that that uh uh restricts our ability to
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
reduce and conserve uh energy use would
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
be uh a problem for us we're we're going
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
to be initiating uh weatherizing
 
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
campaigns and other energy saving uh
 
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
programs in Keen starting right now uh
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
we're we're ready to go and if um HB 549
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
classes that will restrict our ability
 
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
to to implement these so I I urge you to
 
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
vote no or retain it as the uh sponsor
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
suggested um and I'll leave my comments
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
at that thank
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Hassel do we have any I
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
see one hand up from representative
 
00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
samich you have a
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr henel for taking my
 
00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:57.079 align:start position:0%
question um could you elaborate a little
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
bit about what the city of Kean has done
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
so far in the in this in the area of
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and reducing demand and
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
how has the funding support you got
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
through the utilities in the state has
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
assisted you in
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
that thank you for that question uh
 
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
Keane has been a leader I think over the
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
last several decades in trying to move
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh away from renewable energy and
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
control our greenhouse gas emissions we
 
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
were one of the first that got into that
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
back in 2004 and we established a
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
committee way back then which is now
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
called the energy and climate Committee
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
of which I'm the chair and over the past
 
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
two years we have been figuring out how
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
we can transition towards more renewable
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
energy the city of Kean has done a great
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
job as a municipal entity in uh
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
establishing renewable energy uses of
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
their own through uh solar methane gas
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
use uh and so forth um and we have been
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
pushing uh solarized uh operations in
 
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
Keen uh for for many years and we we've
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
started to track that in a way that
 
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
that's that we're going to be able to
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
monitor that uh going forward because we
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're we're making
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
progress in that um I can't really
 
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
answer how much of that money how much
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
of that uh transition has occurred
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
because of things like uh the systems
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
benefit charges um I I don't have the
 
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
answer to that but I I know that if if
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to get serious about
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
weatherization campaigns and converting
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
to um other forms of energy and
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
conservation uh of energy we're going to
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
need any help we can get uh and I can
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
emphasize that that being transparent
 
00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
and being stable is uh as important as
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
anything else uh we want to make sure
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
that we can we can rely on the sources
 
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
of of uh funding that as we go
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
forward thank you very much thank you uh
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
I see representative Kelly pittz with
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
question please unmute yes
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question is
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
it true that Kean sits in a bowl and a
 
00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
lot of the emission from uh greenhouse
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
gases that sit in that bowl that Keen is
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
located in Dees has addressed because a
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
lot of the emissions came from wood
 
00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:44.270 align:start position:0%
lot of the emissions came from wood
burning

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
burning
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
stoves you're bringing up a good
 
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
question uh several years ago uh well
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
Keen does know about the fact that we
 
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
sit in a bowl that is that is a fact of
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
life that we have to live with and one
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
of the things that our city did did a
 
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
number of years ago was to uh initiate a
 
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
program to buy back inefficient uh wood
 
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
stoves and get them replaced with more
 
00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
efficient ones that was a a good program
 
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
fairly successful um and it it is
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
something that we are very cognizant
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
about anytime that a new uh source of
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
energy is put in we make sure that it's
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
not going to add to the uh the bow
 
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
effect that we that we live with
 
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
may I follow up follow ahead M Mr Hansel
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
was was there money uh or grants given
 
00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:37.950 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:39.630 align:start position:0%
from the
[Music]

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:39.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
dees for that
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
program I am not equipped to answer that
 
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know because I wasn't I'm not a
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
city official I'm just a
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
volunteer there was but and and and it
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
went to good use thank you good thank
 
00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:58.390 align:start position:0%
went to good use thank you good thank
you

00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
see no other hands up thank you
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Hansel and we'll move on to our
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
next speaker our next speaker will be Mr
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
Joseph kwasnik for two minutes Mr
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
kwasnik you're
 
00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
on uh thank you Mr Vice chair and thank
 
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to provide
 
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
comments on this bill uh I might also
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
add that I do support um retaining this
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill and committee uh let me just say
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
that house bill
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
549 I think makes inappropriate changes
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
to the current status of approval of
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
each three-year plan of the E and
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
assistance benefit charge by moving the
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
approval from a politically neutral
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
entity the Pu to a highly political
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
entity the New Hampshire legislature
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
this change introduces uncertainty to
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
the approval process puts at Great risk
 
00:40:46.109 --> 00:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
the progress made to date and future
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
progress in reducing energy demand in
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire also want to say that it
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
provides this bill also provides for
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
suspension of any scheduled or pending
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
three-year plan during a declared state
 
00:40:58.829 --> 00:40:58.839 align:start position:0%
of E see this is an inappropriate
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
introdu Interruption of the progress
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
made and to be made in Energy Efficiency
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and offers up only
 
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary political interference in
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
the uh eers implementation in addition
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
it precisely during states of emergency
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
that the eers threeyear plans need to
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
proceed as the plans are at their heart
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
programs to save money for consumers in
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire help ensure the stability
 
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
and resilience of the electric grid and
 
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
also preserve much needed jobs in the
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
industry I might also add uh the bill
 
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
also in restricts the use of the SBC to
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
funding only projects related to the
 
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
provision of electricity this is a false
 
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
economy and the legislature should not
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
change the current use of the systems
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
benefit charge to fund fuel neutral
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency projects and let let
 
00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
not forget that even oil and gas heating
 
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
Sy systems are all electric customers
 
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
paying into the system benefit charge I
 
00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:50.839 align:start position:0%
also want to add that um The Proposal
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
that representative Vos has made today
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
is a process that actually is in Fairly
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
common use within the electric utility
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
industry it's called on Bill financing
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
where the utility in many cases put puts
 
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
up a fund a revolving fund that can be
 
00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
used to fund Energy Efficiency and uh
 
00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
the on Bill financing means that uh
 
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
loans are made and they're paid back
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
through the savings made by the
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
customers through their bills so I might
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
offer that that there is uh work that's
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
been done on that and it does actually
 
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
work thank you very much for your time
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
and happy to take
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you uh M fuzik I'm
 
00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
looking and I see no hands raised for
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
questions so thank you oh I see one hand
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
raised representative McGee please for a
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh thank you Mr Vice
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Mr kwasnik for
 
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question I was just taking
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
notes while you were speaking so it took
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
me a little time to read um you said
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
something about the stability and
 
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
reliability of the grid being something
 
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
that um that this helped support could
 
00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
you say a little more about that because
 
00:42:57.549 --> 00:42:57.559 align:start position:0%
I'm always interested with what happened
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
in Texas and all that we're doing the
 
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
right thing by the stability of how
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
we're supporting the grid sure I when I
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
look at the grid uh there's two factors
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
I always think about one is the uh
 
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
Supply in other words the generating
 
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
facilities that are providing electrons
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
to the system but the other side of the
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
equation is also uh demand reduction and
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
those are also important uh for the
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
stability of the grid and I look at
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency I look at uh renewable
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
energy as load reduction so as we saw in
 
00:43:27.549 --> 00:43:27.559 align:start position:0%
Texas there wasn't enough generation yet
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
the demand was also increasing at the
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
same time therefore putting their Grid
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
at Great risk and unfortunately
 
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
resulting in millions of customers being
 
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
taken off off the grid so I see these
 
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:40.839 align:start position:0%
resources e and uh renewable energy as
 
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
all part of the equation that we need to
 
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
actually make sure is in the mix to
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
preserve and also to protect our the
 
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
resiliency of our grid system thank
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh representative
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative samich you have your hand
 
00:43:58.109 --> 00:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
up for a question yes thank you Mr
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr kwasnik for taking
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
my question uh you mentioned briefly in
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
connection with the SPC charge uh the
 
00:44:10.349 --> 00:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
all fuels approach uh why do you think
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
the SPC is a good vehicle to support
 
00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
various fuels even not just
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
electricity I think that um when you get
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
to what we're really trying to achieve
 
00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:25.559 align:start position:0%
here is really reducing uh carbon
 
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
emissions um and also obviously reducing
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
energy use that's all part of the the
 
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
the mix in the equation um I I come back
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
to the fact that all uh heating
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
customers whether they're gas electric
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
um they're using um uh heat pumps or
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
what have you they're all electric
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
customers they all pay into the SBC and
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
I think that it'd be unfair to not uh
 
00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:49.640 align:start position:0%
have this as a new fuel neutral program
 
00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:51.079 align:start position:0%
because those folks who are paying into
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
the SBC that do not have electric
 
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
heating they should still benefit from
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
that program so that's where I come from
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
and I think it's appropriate and and uh
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do for consumers in
 
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.150 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do for consumers in
New

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
you see no other hands up I see one hand
 
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
up representative parshall you're on for
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
question it's a question for you
 
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas F May I'm not sure
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
of how to address uh but um I see that
 
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
Emily mans is
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
online as a attendee
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
and uh I know she's not able to unmute
 
00:45:32.549 --> 00:45:32.559 align:start position:0%
probably a technical difficulty but if
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
you have a second chance to try that
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
again I think she'd probably appreciate
 
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry that's not relevant to
 
00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
this conversation but I didn't know
 
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
where else to break
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
in uh yes thank you for that information
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
I will ask uh miss Emily man if if you
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
online she's muted I see that could you
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
could you unmute from your
 
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
end I don't believe she can I was
 
00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could unmute from the
 
00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.790 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could unmute from the
other

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
end I don't think we can no okay and
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh uh when it's at the
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
other end uh we we have to move on so he
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
I speak for her then simple question no
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
you don't want that's fine that's fine
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
we'll move on thank you so much good
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
answer thank you I'm going to call on Mr
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
Michael turot right now for his uh
 
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.950 align:start position:0%
Michael turot right now for his uh
testimony

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
available hearing and seeing none I'll
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
move on to Mr Raymond
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
Burke from the New Hampshire legal
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
assistants would you like to
 
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
talk yes thank you Vice chairman can you

uh about why we believe the bill in its

current form um would negatively impact
 
00:47:21.309 --> 00:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
the low-income Energy Efficiency program
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
which um has been in recent years has
 
00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
been recognized nationally as an
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
Exemplar exemplary program
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
um and is critical in the state's

is uh recognized as exemplary I guess
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
nationally so could you say a little bit
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
more about that so that we have an
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
understanding of how our programs are
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
perceived um sure so there's a a
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
national review done by the American
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
Council for an energy efficient economy
 
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:36.520 align:start position:0%

low-income rate payers uh we also uh
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%

making um the electric assistance uh
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
program we participate represent the way

like uh fuel assistance or the electric
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%

00:51:06.359 --> 00:51:07.870 align:start position:0%
the utilities the Pu staff and others

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:07.880 align:start position:0%

00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
um uh protections for low-income
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
customers during the
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic followup Mr chairman yes one
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead thank you uh well I
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
know a number of maybe a year or so ago
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
maybe two years ago we we heard some
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
statistics from I think one of your
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
predecessors uh regarding uh the backlog
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
for energy audits for lowincome uh
 
00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:36.799 align:start position:0%
residents and at the time it was
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
approximately a 10-year backlog for an
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
energy audit and insulation projects uh
 
00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
what is the situation at this
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
point um thank you for that question and
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
and my comments do address that um it
 
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
there's still a years long wait list I I
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately don't have updated numbers
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
for you the last time numbers were ran
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
which was prior to the pandemic I
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
believe there were about a little over
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
8,000 households that were had been
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
approved as far as you know they're
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
income eligible for the program um and
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
and were interested in Energy Efficiency
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
or weatherization Services um but we're
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
waiting for their name to be called um
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
we would expect based on what we've seen
 
00:52:21.069 --> 00:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
in the pandemic um that that that that
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
has not gone down and perhaps has has
 
00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
gone up um but unfortunately I I don't
 
00:52:26.119 --> 00:52:27.069 align:start position:0%
gone up um but unfortunately I I don't
have

00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
um uh recent numbers to give you it can
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
be a little difficult to get that the
 
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
Community Action agencies my
 
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
understanding is um they don't have um
 
00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:37.720 align:start position:0%
an easy way of of just pulling that
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
number from their system there's some uh
 
00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
manual investigation that has to go on
 
00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
and so um the last time it was done I
 
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
think uh was during the docket for the
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh prior three-year plan and I'm not
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
sure that we've seen a new number in a
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
while thank you
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh we have two more
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
speakers and five minutes to go ahead
 
00:53:02.589 --> 00:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
representative Med you have question for
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
this speaker or do you want to hold it
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
for I do thank you thank you make brief
 
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839 align:start position:0%
uh I will um you mentioned that you
 
00:53:13.789 --> 00:53:13.799 align:start position:0%
participated in the current docket and
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
so in relation to the work that you do
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
do you have uh do you have any
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
information for our committee in terms
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
of where that that agreed upon
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
three-year plan fits in to um the
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
discussions that we're having
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
here um well I can just say that that
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
the way home um our client supported um
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
the settlement agreement that that um I
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
think um you've heard about before you
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
know that was joined by the utilities
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate clean energy New
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Conservation law Foundation um
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
and and we thought um that that
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement uh that amended the
 
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
initial plan um
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
would help further the low-income Energy
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
Efficiency program make sure that more
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
households are served to try to address
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
the long weight list that we were just
 
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
discussing um and also uh would
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
Implement some uh changes um that we
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
thought would would add some
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility uh and and and um there were
 
00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:17.799 align:start position:0%
some changes to the offerings uh that
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
the utilities were were were intending
 
00:54:21.069 --> 00:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
to provide that we thought were
 
00:54:23.549 --> 00:54:23.559 align:start position:0%
beneficial for low-income rate payers so
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
we we supported uh that plan and our
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
still that excuse me that agreement um
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
that modified the plan and they still
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
hoping that the commission will will
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
approve it and so we we would be
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
concerned that this bill if it had
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
passed would have um halted the progress
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
that um that that plan and that
 
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:43.720 align:start position:0%
agreement would make over the next three
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
years and my written comments again will
 
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
address that in a little more detail
 
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh Mr U Burke seeing
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
no other hands up we're moving along to
 
00:54:58.750 --> 00:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
the next speaker we have uh Ethan Cole
 
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
member of the public from Lebanon are
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
you on Mr Cole hello yes thank you for
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh for the
 
00:55:07.789 --> 00:55:07.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh I am a small business
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
owner um I live in Lebanon New Hampshire
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
I own a small construction company Earth
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
share construction we do all kinds of uh
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
construction projects with a focus on
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency we do a lot of
 
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
weatherization work we have five
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
employees and we've uh grown our Energy
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
Efficiency work considerably over the
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
last few years years so we are hoping to
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
continue growing creating more jobs uh
 
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
more good jobs in helping our customers
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh reduce their their energy burden uh
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
so we work with home performance
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
customers who are experiencing uh frozen
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
pipes ice dams um and uncomfortable
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
homes and so through this program we've
 
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
been able to create a lot of happy
 
00:55:52.109 --> 00:55:52.119 align:start position:0%
customers who are spending Less on
 
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
energy and now live in healthier more
 
00:55:56.829 --> 00:55:56.839 align:start position:0%
durable more comfortable homes so we
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
oppose this
 
00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you I see no hands up no
 
00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:06.039 align:start position:0%
question so uh thank you for Testimony
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
that was informative thank you we're
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
gonna move on to our next speaker Mr
 
00:56:09.359 --> 00:56:10.990 align:start position:0%
gonna move on to our next speaker Mr
Nick

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
Nick
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
kof conservation law Foundation Mr cof
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
you're on yes thank you um good morning
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
chairman Bose honorable members of the
 
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Nick cof I'm of the
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
conservation law foundation and I
 
00:56:24.029 --> 00:56:24.039 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to comment
 
00:56:26.829 --> 00:56:26.839 align:start position:0%
today on HB 549
 
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency is good for New
 
00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:31.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy and for raid payers
 
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
since 2002 Energy Efficiency measures
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have resulted in
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
cumulative customer Savings in excess of
 
00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.630 align:start position:0%
cumulative customer Savings in excess of
$3.4

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
$3.4
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
billion in fact as Dees just announced
 
00:56:46.029 --> 00:56:46.039 align:start position:0%
last week the state of New Hampshire
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
itself has saved $45 million from Energy
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
Efficiency over the past 11 years the
 
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire utilities 2021 to 2023
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency plan
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
which was filed in September 2020 in
 
00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
furtherance of the ERS would result in
 
00:57:03.069 --> 00:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
additional customer energy cost Savings
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
of more than 1.3
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
billion the Energy Efficiency measures
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
proposed under the 2021 to 2023 plan are
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
all costeffective meaning they they're
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
the lowest cost energy resource this
 
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
means that a unit of energy saved
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
through efficiency under the plan is
 
00:57:23.029 --> 00:57:23.039 align:start position:0%
less expensive than the total lifetime
 
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
cost of a unit of energy from other
 
00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.750 align:start position:0%
cost of a unit of energy from other
resources

00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
by making it less likely that future e
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
plans would receive approval or
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
accomplish the same level of savings HB
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
549 would result in substantially
 
00:57:39.069 --> 00:57:39.079 align:start position:0%
reduced energy benefits for New
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents the provisions in HB
 
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
549 requiring legislative approval of
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
each three-year eers plan and increases
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
to an enumeration of uses for the SBC
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
are unworkable and
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
unrealistic the commission has the
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
resources and the expert
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
to evaluate ERS plans and SBC Rays the
 
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
2021 to 2023 plan consisted of nearly a
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
th000 Pages which was followed by the
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
submission of expert testimony by
 
00:58:07.839 --> 00:58:09.589 align:start position:0%
submission of expert testimony by
multiple

00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
armies in reviewing the plan the
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
commission conducted five days of
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
hearings the legislature has delegated
 
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
decisions involving the ERS and SBC
 
00:58:20.589 --> 00:58:20.599 align:start position:0%
rights to the commission because the
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
commission is prepared to decide the
 
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
complex issues that arise under ERS
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
plans quite simply the legislature lacks
 
00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:29.559 align:start position:0%
the necessary time and resources to
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
sufficiently review the Myriad issues
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
that arise under ERS plans thank you Mr
 
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
kov time is up appreciate it we have one
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
more speaker in two minutes to go uh

Mr COV I appreciate it uh we're going to
 
00:59:32.589 --> 00:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
move on to our last speaker M Miss mlin
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
Mino from the I guess from the clean
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
energy clean energy clean energy New
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there got it out you're on M
 
00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
know thank you Mr Vice chairman for the
 
00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak on HB 549 uh though
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
we would support putting the concept of
 
00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
ERS into law um we would ask that any
 
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
significant changes in ERS planning or
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
implementation not affect back the
 
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
pending 2021 to 2023 plan we the
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
utilities and many stakeholders some of
 
01:00:05.029 --> 01:00:05.039 align:start position:0%
which you just heard from um in good
 
01:00:07.029 --> 01:00:07.039 align:start position:0%
faith followed current Law and puc
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
Orders and invested tremendous amount of
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
our time and resources to participate in
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
the planning process and dockit to
 
01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
review this plan and we would
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that that work um be
 
01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
honored and let the process come to its
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
conclusion um we really think that
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
significant changes like were proposed
 
01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:32.039 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 549 should really be only
 
01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
considered after um the pending
 
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
plan um though the recommendation to
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
retain HB 549 is a significant
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
improvement over um passing it we would
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
still ask for a an itl recommendation
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
having this bill looming over the
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
programs would continue uh to offer
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
consider uncertainty and our local
 
01:00:59.549 --> 01:00:59.559 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency businesses and
 
01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
employers are harmed by this uncertainty
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
they're really looking for Clear
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
direction if they are asked to ramp up

their work and invest in additional
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
staff and equipment or or are the
 
01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
programs likely to be taken away Energy
 
01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
Efficiency is a local investment that
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
benefits all rate payers and we think
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
should be an important part of our
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
economic economic recovery following the
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%

that the lawyers came up with and what
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
it basically the amendment does is it
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
grandfathers in anybody who uses uh
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
useful thermal energy for obtaining
 
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates up to
 
01:08:50.349 --> 01:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
January 1st of next year so that would
 
01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
be cover any project that's already
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
getting them and any project that's you
 
01:08:58.110 --> 01:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
know in the works right now you know and
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
it gives them another almost 11 months
 
01:09:03.149 --> 01:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
to implement that and get on board and
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's basically the only change that
 
01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
Bill okay thank you uh I have a question
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
with regard about the amendment
 
01:09:14.159 --> 01:09:15.749 align:start position:0%
with regard about the amendment
representative

01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
Harrington the amendment says that you
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
can't build one of these systems after
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
January 1st of 2022 and qualify for
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
thermal Rex
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
are there systems that are currently in
 
01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
development that might not go online
 
01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
until after January 1st
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
20 excuse me thank you for the question
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh chairman I I don't um I don't have
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
specific knowledge of anything but I
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
thought since uh most of these projects
 
01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:46.759 align:start position:0%
are I mean I'd even be open to if
 
01:09:48.669 --> 01:09:48.679 align:start position:0%
someone could come forward and say well
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
we have a project in wherever that's not
 
01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
going to go online until February of
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
2022 I'd be open to making that change I
 
01:09:59.149 --> 01:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
I thought the giving 11 months out was
 
01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
probably sufficient but like I say if
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
there's an actual project out there that
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
somebody can mention uh I could
 
01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
certainly say you know they they went
 
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
forward with the idea they'd get these
 
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
wrecks then we ought to not uh you know
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
pull the rug out from underneath them
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
and we could amend the date but I don't
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
know of any specific
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
project okay thank you the chair

he submitted testimony and and uh I
 
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
think one of the towns that he has

01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%

01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
represent all right since Mr Fring
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear to be here we'll call on
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
our next speaker who is Mr Bruce Burke
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%

speak apparently
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
not so Mr chairman could I ask a
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
question uh representative oxam is
 
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
recognized for the question thank you I
 
01:12:24.189 --> 01:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
have a vague notion that a an
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
announcement went out that we were going
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
to be hearing this uh resumed session in
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
the afternoon I'm wondering if these
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
people have been ill advised and are
 
01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
expecting us to take up this bill in at
 
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
o'clock um any such announcement was
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
noticed in the calendar so
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
um the house rules require a resumed
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
public hearing to be noticed at least 24
 
01:12:58.030 --> 01:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
hours in advance and we did that and if
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
people didn't get the right information
 
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate but um we followed the
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
rules thank you okay next up is um Mr
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%

01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
here yes thank you for taking my uh
 
01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
comments um uh uh my fairly brief uh
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
comments the uh again our our committee
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
our energy and climate committee I'm the
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
chair of that and we are in in the
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
process of implementing this program
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
which again relies on uh encouraging our
 
01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:43.719 align:start position:0%
community to switch to renewable energy
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
in all forms not just electricity but
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
thermal and transportation uses over the
 
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
next several
 
01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
decades uh and we felt that this this uh
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
HB 213
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
would uh hinder that in two ways one is
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
that the any reduction in the renewable
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
Port portfolio standard would discourage
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
the production of renewable energy in
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
our state and make it more difficult for
 
01:14:11.629 --> 01:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
Keen to achieve uh the goals that we're
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
looking for uh and that does include
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
thermal wrecks as well if those are
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated uh they will be less um
 
01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
incentive to uh to transition away from
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh fossil fuels towards renewable energy
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
sources um just as a private comment my
 
01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
my uh own family business in Keen uh a
 
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
few years ago uh converted our heating
 
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
system from oil to uh a million
 
01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
btu uh wood chip boiler uh that Fring
 
01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
energy put in for us you mentioned Fring
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
earlier and the thermal recks that were
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
getting for that are certainly uh
 
01:14:59.550 --> 01:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
important to us and if we had to make
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
that decision again without the thermal
 
01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
rexs it probably would have been
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
something we would have had to take
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
seriously into account in the in the
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
whole equation of whether we went
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
forward with that with that uh process
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
um so thermal rexs I think are important
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
and should be kept in uh in the mix and
 
01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
uh we would hope that you would uh vote
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
no on um House Bill 213
 
01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:26.950 align:start position:0%
no on um House Bill 213
thank

01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much Mr Hansel a
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
minute 56 seconds well done are there
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
any questions I see uh representative
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
oxenham has her hand raised you're
 
01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
question excuse me that was just left up
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
inadvertently okay sorry ssuch is
 
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr Hensel for taking my question um
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
since we're not all that intimately
 
01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with the thermal re system my
 
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is that thermal recks are
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
are treated differently than like solar
 
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
reck and um how how do they work in in
 
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
in uh incentivizing for example uh uh
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
thermal heating systems like the one you
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned from your
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
business thank you for that question and
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert on them either uh we
 
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
also have a a solar uh uh array on the
 
01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
top of our roof at at my company and
 
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
I've been familiar with the solar Rex
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
for many years but we are starting now
 
01:16:36.629 --> 01:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh after we've had a a couple of years
 
01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
of uh uh heating with our new uh wood
 
01:16:44.189 --> 01:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
chip boiler uh Fring energy is
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
processing those those thermal RS for us
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
and they as far as I can see they're
 
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
handled very similar to the way that uh
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
the solar wrecks are handled we get a
 
01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
check from them from uh uh the
 
01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.270 align:start position:0%
check from them from uh uh the
aggregator

01:16:58.270 --> 01:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
aggregator
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
um uh quarterly I think it is or maybe
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
half uh two times a year for what we
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
have produced with our thermal
 
01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
recks U followup Mr chairman follow up
 
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
um so uh in light of the fact that your
 
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
your town of Kean Mr Hansel is uh was
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
strongly affected by wood burning uh
 
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
stoves that were pollution at the time
 
01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh do you feel that there will be a
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
demand in the future for uh clean U wood
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
burning facilities or or in um furnaces
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
in your in your
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
municipality and is this something that
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
the business Community there is also
 
01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.470 align:start position:0%
the business Community there is also
impacted

01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
by uh very good question thank you uh I
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
know that that was a concern when we
 
01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
were looking into whether we should
 
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
invest in a in a wood chip boiler uh we
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
went to the city and and talked to them
 
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
about that very question and uh
 
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
coincidentally the city uh the city and
 
01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
the school districts have also invested
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
in wood chip boiler technology mainly
 
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
the school district um so it's not new
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh in our municipality and uh we went
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
over this problem with uh froling and uh
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
we fairly well convinced they convinced
 
01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
all of us that the clean technology for
 
01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
the exhaust is uh perfectly good for for
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
our uh our our
 
01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
community thank you very much I don't
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
know whe that answered your question but
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
yes it
 
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
did okay thank you um representative
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
McGee has recognized for a
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um and
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate it um I actually our My Town
 
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
actually is also invested in uh pellet
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
boilers and did that early on and I
 
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
received testimony from our energy
 
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
committee um discussing the lowering of
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
the RPS threshold as devaluing the Rex
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
which is something we were just talking
 
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
about um and the way that they view it
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
is that it's not a stable investment
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
environment so I appreciate um that
 
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington was saying the
 
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
way the bill will be modified by the
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
amendment is to say that if you've
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
already invested
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh then you know you won't be affected
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
going forward but uh how do you see this
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
affecting future investments in the
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
state um because I think there are a lot
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
of towns that are primed at this point
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
to make the Investments that some of us
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
made early so I wonder if you could say
 
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
something about your experience um in
 
01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
your town with when you invested and
 
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
whether you would make the investment if
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill were to go into
 
01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
effect thank you for the question
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
uh anything that that
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
incentivizes the in investment in
 
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
renewable energy I think should be
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
encouraged uh we are in a state that
 
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a lot of incentives for for
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
this type of investment and anything
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
that that draws back on that uh which is
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
what this would do would be a negative
 
01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:19.639 align:start position:0%
impact in our in our plans to go forward
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
with our with our program so uh I see it
 
01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
as as a negative um for Investments both
 
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
on the private level and and at the M
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
Municipal level thank you Mr Hansel
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
could I also mention that Mr Burke who
 
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
was scheduled to testify somebody sent
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
me a text saying he's back on the line
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
and he's able now so I don't I don't
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
Him thank you I do see him so I will uh
 
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
seen no more questions for um Mr
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
Wheeler no yes Mr
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hansel I will call on Mr Burke from
 
01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Mr Burke you have the floor
 
01:21:13.149 --> 01:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
unmute good morning um Mr chairman and
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
committee Members First uh I would like
 
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
to offer my thanks to the committee uh
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
whether we agree on policy or not I am
 
01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh deeply moved by how much time you all
 
01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
have invested in our state so thank you
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
very much for that uh I oppose House
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
Bill 213 because I think it seeks it
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't seek it decreases percentages
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
for both class one and class two thermal
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
power the three points that I'd like to
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
make why I oppose this bill one over the
 
01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:53.719 align:start position:0%
weekend I sent you a report from Synergy
 
01:21:58.910 --> 01:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
energy 20 20 which said that uh behind
 
01:22:01.229 --> 01:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
the meter solar which this is connected
 
01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
to saves as much as 11 cents per
 
01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour for New England from 2014
 
01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:07.030 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour for New England from 2014
to

01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
2019 they go on to say quote as a result
 
01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
more BT more PTM solar not only
 
01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
decreases the quantity of electricity
 
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
produced it also reduces the price paid
 
01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
for electricity which benefits all New
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
England tax pay payers rate payers which
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
I think has been a concern of this
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
committee from 2002 2014 to
 
01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
2019 solar behind the meter saved over a
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in energy benefits for
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
New England uh we produced less
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
electricity which reduced overall
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
electricity prices they go on to say
 
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
that in terms of health CO2 emissions
 
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
over these five years decreased by 4.6
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
million tons that is like taking a
 
01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
million cars off the
 
01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.070 align:start position:0%
million cars off the
highway

01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
highway
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
two I think that the renewable portfolio
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
standard is the only state standard we
 
01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
have for renewable energy and Thermo
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
electricity we are behind other states
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
30 seconds to meet these goals so I
 
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
would say very quickly if my time is up
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
you know that each one of the class one
 
01:23:20.189 --> 01:23:20.199 align:start position:0%
and class two reduces these standards
 
01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
and it is not to the benefit of our
 
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
climate or our jobs in New Hampshire
 
01:23:27.390 --> 01:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Burke we appreciate your
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:37.629 --> 01:23:37.639 align:start position:0%
Burke seeing none I will call on our
 
01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
final speaker for this resumed Public
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
public hearing and that is Jim
 
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
wheeler a member of the public who is
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
representing the city of
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
Berlin you are next you have the floor
 
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
for two minutes thank you chairman Bo
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee I really
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time uh you're giving
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
everyone including the city of Berlin
 
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
today uh I want to talk specifically
 
01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
about House Bill 13 with regard to its
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
impact on the city and um that would
 
01:24:11.550 --> 01:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
come through its impact on Burgess
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
biopower which um I suspect you've uh
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
heard over the years how important
 
01:24:19.870 --> 01:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
Burgess is to the forest industry uh and
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
in particular to the the uh business
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
climate in the northern part of the
 
01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:24.990 align:start position:0%
climate in the northern part of the
state

01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
so I I want to Echo uh that theme with
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
regard to what's important to uh jobs
 
01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:33.719 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
economy um since the demise of the paper
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
industry the city's made great strides
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh with reforming our economy and
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
Burgess has been at the center of that
 
01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
transformation uh besides the regional
 
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
impact uh with direct and indirect
 
01:24:55.149 --> 01:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
jobs Burgess is the city's largest
 
01:24:58.030 --> 01:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayer um we're estimating a tax
 
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
payment of approximately 1.8
 
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
million uh to the city this upcoming
 
01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
year put that in perspective uh we will
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
raise approximately 18 million total in
 
01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
local tax dollars this year so burges
 
01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
will represent
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
10% uh of uh property tax revenue coming
 
01:25:19.229 --> 01:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
city so given their importance we've got
 
01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
every motivation to see that Burgess is
 
01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.109 align:start position:0%
every motivation to see that Burgess is
success

01:25:25.109 --> 01:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
success
 
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
successful and uh we work with them uh
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
as often as we can uh to make sure that
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
happens one of the ways we're working
 
01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
with them is uh to help uh them find
 
01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:40.280 align:start position:0%
uses for their thermal energy uh they've
 
01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
got a vast amount of thermal energy as a
 
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
byproduct of power
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
generation and uh with every BTU of
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
thermal energy they can use burgus
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
becomes a more and more energy efficient
 
01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.910 align:start position:0%
becomes a more and more energy efficient
facility

01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
so an example uh of one of the ways
 
01:25:58.270 --> 01:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
we're working with them is we are
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
planning a downtown reconstruction
 
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
project uh this downtown reconstruction
 
01:26:07.149 --> 01:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
project has a um a component of it that
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
utilizes thermal energy from
 
01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
Burgess we're going to use it both to um
 
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
provide heat to businesses uh and public
 
01:26:19.149 --> 01:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
buildings in the
 
01:26:23.109 --> 01:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
downtown and to remove snow and ice um
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
so we want to use the lowcost heat as an
 
01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
attraction for economic development of
 
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
businesses in the downtown this
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
concept's uh been used before and we
 
01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
actually took it from uh Holland
 
01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
Michigan which did this in the
 
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
1980s and uh their operation continues
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
on today it's been highly Su
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
successful um we feel our project is
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
better than Hollands because we're uh
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
using renewable energy and Holland
 
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
actually um is based on fossil fuel
 
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
so last year we applied for a build
 
01:26:59.550 --> 01:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
Grant under the federal DOT for our
 
01:27:01.709 --> 01:27:01.719 align:start position:0%
project it's the same same funding
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
source that conquered applied to and
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
obtained for its downtown reconstruction
 
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
project which I'm sure you're all
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with um we weren't successful
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
last year but in the debriefing that we
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
obtained or got from the uh Federal uh
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
management staff at Federal do they
 
01:27:23.709 --> 01:27:23.719 align:start position:0%
indicated that we scored extremely high
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
um we you know encouraged us to to make
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
some amendments to our application and
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
resubmit and so we are in our planning
 
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
stages now uh we're getting ready to
 
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
resubmit to build again this
 
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
year so the use of thermal energy and
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
the way that we uh intend to use it is
 
01:27:44.590 --> 01:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
incentivized through the current recre
 
01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
program uh House Bill 213 if it moves
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
forward we'll completely change our
 
01:27:53.149 --> 01:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
project uh and make it less attractive
 
01:27:56.189 --> 01:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
for funding and negatively affect our
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
ongoing Economic Development efforts um
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
essentially or plainly I'd say that
 
01:28:03.149 --> 01:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
disincentivizing thermal energy in this
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
way disincentivizes Energy Efficiency um
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
which which doesn't seem to make sense
 
01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
so uh for these reasons and the others
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
you here today uh the Ci's are asking
 
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
you to vote no on host Bill 213 thank
 
01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Wheeler I'm sorry I
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
didn't identify you as the city manager
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
of the city of Berlin but you didn't
 
01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
register that way so I didn't know it
 
01:28:31.149 --> 01:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
until representative Troy mner who sits
 
01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
on the committee pointed it out to me
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
but we appreciate you testifying today
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
and giving giving us your perspective on
 
01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
how this bill will affect the city of
 
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
Berlin representative burner has a
 
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
question and well question comment um to
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
what uh Mr Willer was talking about uh
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
we did sign bill 57 which we all
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
supported in our committee a few years
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
ago that that's going to run out that
 
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know that has a a Time cap on it's
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
the only agreement that we have for pu
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
agreement for all the new members here
 
01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
um and part of this project that uh Mr
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
will has been working on very hard is to
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
offset that so that they can make that
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
more efficiency so that when that
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
expires that they'll be able to keep urg
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
just open because it'll make it it's
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
going to make it hard to renew that
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
agreement down the road with the Pu you
 
01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:27.400 align:start position:0%
know PC G so your question for Mr
 
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
Wheeler is to elaborate a little bit
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
yeah a little bit just a little bit on
 
01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:31.590 align:start position:0%
yeah a little bit just a little bit on
that

01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
J yeah this I mean since since 577
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh it it had a three-year window and so
 
01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh Burgess has been working uh to find
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
ways to become more energy efficient um
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
and that primarily will come through the
 
01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
use of making use of their thermal um
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
energy so um again that this this
 
01:29:59.669 --> 01:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
project would consume uh you know a
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
chunk of that thermal energy and and
 
01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
would go towards making them more
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
efficient and making them uh viable
 
01:30:11.189 --> 01:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh much longer into the future
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
and uh you know that's why I wanted to
 
01:30:17.229 --> 01:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
give the committee the uh the context um
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
with them representing 10% of our local
 
01:30:22.669 --> 01:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
tax dollars I mean you can imagine uh
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
what kind of impact that would have if
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
operated thank you Mr Willer I have a
 
01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
question for you is one of the projects
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
you're working on a um a greenhouse that
 
01:30:43.109 --> 01:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
U will grow vegetables year round using
 
01:30:47.470 --> 01:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
heat from the Burgess biomass plant uh
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
to keep the green houses warm is that
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
one of the projects that that is a
 
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
project that bir
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
um is uh considering and working on and
 
01:31:00.430 --> 01:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
they' come to our planning board about a
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
year ago um so it's not it's it's it's
 
01:31:06.109 --> 01:31:06.119 align:start position:0%
entirely on their property so it's
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
really uh one that they're undertaking
 
01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
without uh you know without any City
 
01:31:15.149 --> 01:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
involvement other than coming for PL U
 
01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
plan review and that sort of
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
thing okay thank you uh representative
 
01:31:22.669 --> 01:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
Harrington is recognized for a question
 
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank we take my
 
01:31:25.629 --> 01:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
question I guess a quick comment in a
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
question I'm just want to make sure you
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
understand that this bill does nothing
 
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:31.719 align:start position:0%
to change the class 2 subsidies that
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
burges will get they'll continue at the
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
same rate that they are right now and
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
there will be no change to that
 
01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
whatsoever do you you agree with
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
that again I'm no expert on this stuff
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that they would not
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
um that that this bill would make them
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
ineligible for renewable energy credits
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
for thermal energy well that not okay
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
let me we're talking about electric
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
production of class two I I don't
 
01:32:00.669 --> 01:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
believe that representa Harrington is
 
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to question the testimony he's
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
bill again you correct Peter sorry about
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
that I'll take it back thanks for
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
keeping me on my
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
toes thank you representative s you're
 
01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
01:32:21.109 --> 01:32:21.119 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chairman uh Mr
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
Wheeler uh can you give us an idea of
 
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
the environmental um impact that uh that
 
01:32:31.950 --> 01:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
facility has in Berlin for the region if
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
I can figure out how to get this stupid
 
01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
printer to work the right
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
way all right uh so Mr Wheeler uh could
 
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
you uh tell us a little bit about the uh
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
overall Regional impact of the
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
employment offered by uh that facility
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
in your in your in your town sure I mean
 
01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
they they obviously have uh Direct jobs
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
of which there are between 25 and 30 on
 
01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
site uh but then that spirals out um you
 
01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
know into the woods um into other
 
01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
logging industry related jobs um my
 
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
understanding and the estimates you know
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
that it goes out to at least 300 U jobs
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
uh both direct and
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
indirect uh so you know you have again
 
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
without a paper mill here they really
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
have filled the hole in terms of uh the
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
forestry in Industry continuing people
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
out in the woods cutting trees trees
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
being chipped being brought to the
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
facility uh it's been fairly significant
 
01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:38.470 align:start position:0%
facility uh it's been fairly significant
quite

01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
quite
 
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
significant U followup Mr chairman
 
01:33:44.109 --> 01:33:44.119 align:start position:0%
follow up so if I understood your your
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
project that you're working with by bges
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
on is that uh basically an attempt to
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
use the waste heat for other purposes
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
that were not used pre previously that's
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
exactly right it's it's waste heat
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
that's currently um well it is waste
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's essentially going to the sky and
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
what makes this project viable uh which
 
01:34:09.109 --> 01:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
I I should explain is the proximity of
 
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
the plant to our downtown it's uh very
 
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
similar to Holland's Holland Michigan
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
which I mentioned uh they had a power
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
plant close to their downtown which
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
makes it um practical to bring the heat
 
01:34:23.709 --> 01:34:23.719 align:start position:0%
to the downtown I mean I'm I'm sitting
 
01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:25.880 align:start position:0%
in my office right now at 168 Main
 
01:34:28.109 --> 01:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
Street I can look out my window and see
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
the plant uh right across the river um
 
01:34:33.870 --> 01:34:33.880 align:start position:0%
so we would be taking some of that waste
 
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
heat and uh using it beneficially in the
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
downtown thank you very much okay thank
 
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Pim Andel is
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you Mr
 
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh chairman and thank you Mr Wheeler for
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh giving us your time um could you
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
explain to me uh maybe to all of us a
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
little bit about the
 
01:35:06.669 --> 01:35:06.679 align:start position:0%
need for a market for uh lowgrade wood
 
01:35:11.229 --> 01:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
products in this state and how what
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
you're doing in the the town of uh
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
goal I I I will admit out of the gate I
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
am not forestry expert um so I don't
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
know that I can do that well there are
 
01:35:30.669 --> 01:35:30.679 align:start position:0%
Mr Wheeler if I could just
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
interrupt stock of the uh New Hampshire
 
01:35:35.950 --> 01:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
Timberland Association has his hand
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
raised and is online so if we if you
 
01:35:41.070 --> 01:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
would like to defer that question to him
 
01:35:43.870 --> 01:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
I'll call on him once we finish uh all
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
the questions we have for you that's
 
01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
fantastic Jay he'll do a much better job
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
that I will could I do a followup then
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
okay follow up question and you don't
 
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
really have to spend much time uh
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
answering it but uh there was an article
 
01:36:02.109 --> 01:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
this morning uh in the conquered monitor
 
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
about uh biochar a method for using Uh
 
01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
lowgrade Wood uh waste and I'm just
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
wondering if uh the town of Berlin has
 
01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
uh looked into that at
 
01:36:18.669 --> 01:36:18.679 align:start position:0%
all I believe that that sounds famili
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
familiar to me uh I believe that is
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
something that vergis uh has considered
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I internally where that is in their
 
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
discussions I don't know but it I I have
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
heard that before thank you you're
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
welcome and thank you uh Mr wheer for
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
being here I'm sure Mr stock when he's
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
allowed to speak can also speak to the
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
biochar question but uh before we
 
01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
recognize Mr stock there is one more
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
question from JD bernardy who was
 
01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak thank you Mr
 
01:36:54.510 --> 01:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you Mr Wheeler uh can
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
you tell us the timeline that you have
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
for this expansion given the fact that
 
01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
the uh the amendment that we've heard
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
grandfathers all the current uses what
 
01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
what is the timeline for completion of
 
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
your expansion efforts We Will We Will
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
reapply um to build uh this
 
01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
spring so I believe applications are due
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
in April
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
typically the uh responses on whether
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
you're successful or not um come in
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
September and once you're notified if
 
01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:36.510 align:start position:0%
September and once you're notified if
you're

01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
successful it it there is a a I think
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
it's about a threeyear
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
window um between notification and
 
01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
actual uh start of construction so that
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
that's the time frame that we would be
 
01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay followup follow up so three years
 
01:38:01.629 --> 01:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
from Once the grant has been authorized
 
01:38:01.639 --> 01:38:02.550 align:start position:0%
from Once the grant has been authorized
to

01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:38:04.830 --> 01:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
completion of the project to make it
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
functional is that what we're talk three
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
years until start of construction and
 
01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
then of course you'd have the
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
construction window so I I think for a
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
project this large we would be talking
 
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
something longer than a year so to be
 
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
safe might as well say two years so five
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
I guess you could say five years from
 
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
September of 2021 is when the project
 
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
complete thank you you're welcome okay
 
01:38:35.950 --> 01:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Wheeler see okay one more
 
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
question representative McGee is
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
authorized for a question thank you Mr
 
01:38:42.189 --> 01:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you Mr Wheeler for
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question so based on what you
 
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
were just saying about the time uh the
 
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
length of time that a project would take
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
to come online would would implementing
 
01:38:55.390 --> 01:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
this bill Bill saying that as of 2022
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
there would be a cut off for people who
 
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
would be eligible would that affect uh
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
the decision to go forward with the
 
01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
project in terms of the U economics of
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
it it it would probably cause us to
 
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
rethink the project um and it may kill
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
the project in the way that we've
 
01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
thought about
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
it one of the reasons we have this
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
component of waste heat in the project
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
is because it's innov
 
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
and uh the way we've been able to
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
include it it's Transportation related
 
01:39:30.669 --> 01:39:30.679 align:start position:0%
and you know and we've been told Again
 
01:39:34.990 --> 01:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
by the federal do that um why our
 
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
project is attractive because it has
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
this is because it has this
 
01:39:43.589 --> 01:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
component so uh a build Grant would pro
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
pro may not become or may not be um as
 
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
attractive and we may have to pursue
 
01:39:52.589 --> 01:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
other methods I guess of funding I guess
 
01:39:52.599 --> 01:39:53.950 align:start position:0%
other methods I guess of funding I guess
that's

01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
time would only tell but I suspect we
 
01:39:59.229 --> 01:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
would have to rethink our funding
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
strategy and okay
 
01:40:06.030 --> 01:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
oh followup I I just had a thought with
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
what we have stop in 20 minutes go ahead
 
01:40:11.589 --> 01:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
and follow up yeah the the followup was
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
just you mentioned that the concept of
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
using the waste heat was Innovative and
 
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
I'm curious whether that Innovation was
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
the result of the fact that there was a
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
program that you were participating in
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
or that Burgess was partic participating
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
in I would say from very early on in the
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
concept of the project uh yes the rec
 
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
program was one of the things that we
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
thought would make our project viable it
 
01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
it was not a it was by no means an
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
afterthought it was something that we
 
01:40:44.669 --> 01:40:44.679 align:start position:0%
thought about early on and is important
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
to to
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
Burgess okay thank you very much you're
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
welcome thank
 
01:40:52.669 --> 01:40:52.679 align:start position:0%
you thank you and thank you Mr Willer
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
for being here we really appreciate it I
 
01:40:58.350 --> 01:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
would like to Now call on Jason stock
 
01:41:00.189 --> 01:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
who represents the new Hamp New
 
01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Timberland Owners Association
 
01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
Mr stock uh the floor is yours good good
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
morning can you hear me yes we can okay
 
01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
before you start the ticker um I just
 
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to make you aware that the link
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
on the PDF of the calendar isn't working
 
01:41:22.350 --> 01:41:22.360 align:start position:0%
and there are I know a bunch of people
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
that signed up to
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
testify on the original Bill last week
 
01:41:30.669 --> 01:41:30.679 align:start position:0%
and we're on the list that we that were
 
01:41:34.109 --> 01:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
that are hoping to testify today so um
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're raising their hands so I just
 
01:41:38.430 --> 01:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to make you aware that part of
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
the reason why you may not be hearing
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
from Mr froling and Company and others I
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
know some of my members they ran into
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
some technical glitches getting onto the
 
01:41:50.109 --> 01:41:50.119 align:start position:0%
meeting um just to make you aware that I
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
did email the folks on the uh on on the
 
01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
calendar to make them aware of it but um
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll start my testimony now and and
 
01:42:02.189 --> 01:42:02.199 align:start position:0%
for the just by way of background Jason
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
stock New Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
Association we represent land owners in
 
01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
the state forest products
 
01:42:11.109 --> 01:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
industry um we have about 1300 members
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
who own and manage about a million Acres
 
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
of of Timberland in the state of New
 
01:42:18.910 --> 01:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and New Hampshire is uh
 
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
about two-thirds of all that wood that's
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
standing as low grade unable to make
 
01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
Lumber or any or higher quality products
 
01:42:31.470 --> 01:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
um such as veneer or Lumber um annually
 
01:42:33.149 --> 01:42:33.159 align:start position:0%
about three to three and a half million
 
01:42:35.870 --> 01:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
green tons of wood all species all
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
product are are are harvested in the
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
state and when you look at that about a
 
01:42:43.709 --> 01:42:43.719 align:start position:0%
million of that is chipped that's wood
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's chipped for generally energy
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
purposes either going into a pellet
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
Market or going to an energy project um
 
01:42:54.589 --> 01:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
and so you know in as much as House Bill
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
213 which we oppose um in as much as
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
that hurts the RPS program and quite
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
quite suely goes after class three
 
01:43:07.589 --> 01:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
biomass and the thermal credit we're
 
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
we're testifying in in a an opposition
 
01:43:13.709 --> 01:43:13.719 align:start position:0%
to it the other piece of the of the um
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
puzzle here is that even the Mills the
 
01:43:19.229 --> 01:43:19.239 align:start position:0%
higher grade products they they produce
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
chips that also need a market um you
 
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
take a round l you make Square Lumber
 
01:43:26.709 --> 01:43:26.719 align:start position:0%
you chip that slab those are those need
 
01:43:31.589 --> 01:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
to go to uh go to markets as well um and
 
01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
when I when we look at the original
 
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of the RPS law biomass and and
 
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
energy um both thermal and heat or
 
01:43:41.310 --> 01:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
thermal and and electricity really hits
 
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
several of the key cornerstones fuel
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
fuel diversity Timber has cut over in
 
01:43:50.189 --> 01:43:50.199 align:start position:0%
almost every town every year in the
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire there's about 2,
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
to 2500 Timber sales a year um keeps the
 
01:43:59.589 --> 01:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
money local uh you heard from Berlin the
 
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
economic activity occurring there when
 
01:44:04.350 --> 01:44:04.360 align:start position:0%
you look at the six biomass plants
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
historically they've supported another
 
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
$250 million in economic activity 950
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
jobs thermal consumes about 70,000 tons
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
a year put that in perspective that's
 
01:44:21.070 --> 01:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
2500 truckloads of lowgrade wood going
 
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
into thermal projects
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
um environmental benefits I'm not going
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
to get into you know emissions and all
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
that what I can tell you and I know this
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
comes up regularly is is biomass carbon
 
01:44:35.709 --> 01:44:35.719 align:start position:0%
neutral is it a good fuel um EPA has
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
determined that it is um and and has has
 
01:44:43.629 --> 01:44:43.639 align:start position:0%
said yes it is it is carbon neutral um
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
when we look at growth using US Forest
 
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
Service data New Hampshire continues to
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
grow 84 million cubic feet a year more
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
wood than is harvested or is lost to
 
01:45:01.390 --> 01:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
Natural mortality we have a net growth
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
um thank you carbon sequestration about
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
2.2 metric tons a year are are
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
sequestered because these forests are
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
growing real real quick this is a
 
01:45:16.830 --> 01:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
dispatchable product or dispatchable
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
electricity some people will argue it's
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a subsidy this is a a base
 
01:45:26.189 --> 01:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
load disp aable power and you know yes
 
01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
you know if it is a subsidy the the rate
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
payers are getting something for it
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
they're getting fuel diversity they're
 
01:45:35.070 --> 01:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
getting a dispatchable power source
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
something I'm sure the folks in Texas
 
01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
would have loved to have had last week
 
01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
and with respect to the with the the uh
 
01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment um and it's not clear how
 
01:45:48.669 --> 01:45:48.679 align:start position:0%
it affects the bill whether it's just
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
the the grandfathering provision but
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
listening to this the sponsor
 
01:45:56.109 --> 01:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
class three listening to his testimony
 
01:45:58.990 --> 01:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
class three wood is still
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated um and that's that's a huge
 
01:46:05.149 --> 01:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
problem for us also as you heard from
 
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
Berlin it forecloses the opportunity for
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
Future Energy Efficiency projects at
 
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
some of these existing plants such as
 
01:46:15.629 --> 01:46:15.639 align:start position:0%
Berlin or even projects like green
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
houses in the in the loud area where you
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
you have some wood shifts getting used
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
to make heat for for Greenhouse projects
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
Mr stock yes can I ask you
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
um I I can conclude my testimony there
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
chairman just we we oppose House Bill
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
2113 thank you understood my question
 
01:46:37.229 --> 01:46:37.239 align:start position:0%
was going to be that there are several
 
01:46:39.149 --> 01:46:39.159 align:start position:0%
other people who need to would like to
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
speak and we only have 12 minutes left
 
01:46:43.350 --> 01:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
so I was going to ask you if you could
 
01:46:46.910 --> 01:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
you could finish up but I guess
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
you right okay thank you and for
 
01:46:52.430 --> 01:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
committee members I will ask you to hold
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
your question question so that we can
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
allow these folks who have requested to
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
speak to do so our next call on Dennis
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%

01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
hands and according to Mr stock uh they
 
01:47:16.709 --> 01:47:16.719 align:start position:0%
are not having an opportunity to join us
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh can you look into what's going on
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
there and can we get them are they are

see them in the attendee list with their
 
01:47:33.790 --> 01:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
hands raised means that they are

Consulting office in this area since
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
just after World War II I would just
 
01:48:15.310 --> 01:48:15.320 align:start position:0%
highlight a few points from my written
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
testimony which I emailed the committee

I also am opposed to House Bill
 
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
2113 uh in its elimination of class
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
three existing biomass from this
 
01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
standard these markets are vital to land
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
owners and Timber Harvesters in the
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
entire Forest products industry across
 
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
the entire State it's a very important
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
forestry tool and just this segment of
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
the forest products industry uh was
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
recently determined to contribute about
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
a quarter of a billion dollars to the
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
state's gross domestic product
 
01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
specifically in my work for every load
 
01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
of highquality Saw logs which we
 
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
responsibly Harvest from a site we
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
typically generate two or more tractor
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
trailer loads of lowquality chips and
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
roundwood and if you don't weed your
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
garden you don't have much of a
 
01:49:14.229 --> 01:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
vegetable garden at the end of the
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
season it's a homegrown renewable and
 
01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
reliable source of electric power thank
 
01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.910 align:start position:0%

committee members um my name is Mark
 
01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
froling and I'm um an opponent of this
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
213 and um so I'm in strong opposition
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill and um we have a tremendous
 
01:49:59.229 --> 01:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
amount of money invested in
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
um utilizing the Rex so when the rec
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
bill came around and it was put into
 
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
position we heavily
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
invested um in in our technology which
 
01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
is in fact boiler installations and dry
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
chip manufacturing which generates more
 
01:50:19.709 --> 01:50:19.719 align:start position:0%
thermal recks and we um with our
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
technology and with our services we
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
produce about onethird of all the Recs
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and we
 
01:50:28.629 --> 01:50:28.639 align:start position:0%
have recently made an enormous
 
01:50:32.030 --> 01:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
investment really all of my personal
 
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
belongings have gone into this
 
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
investment and this house build 213 um
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
will take all of this away my personal
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
workings of my entire life will go down
 
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:45.800 align:start position:0%
the tubes with this really um just a
 
01:50:49.629 --> 01:50:49.639 align:start position:0%
poor Bill really all together and I um
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
obviously you know I had some
 
01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
difficulties getting on this site here
 
01:50:57.069 --> 01:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
today but I'm just really upset about
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
how this bill could get even to this
 
01:51:00.750 --> 01:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
stage and how this could get proposed it
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
is really a shame we have really good
 
01:51:06.589 --> 01:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
employees we have a tremendous amount of
 
01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
biomass suppliers to our facility we
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
have trucks rolling in as I'm speaking
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
here and this would be a
 
01:51:19.270 --> 01:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
devastating would have a de devastating
 
01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
effect on our company and my own
 
01:51:24.910 --> 01:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
livelihood and the 15 employees that we
 
01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:25.709 align:start position:0%

subcontractors um the T-Rex is one of
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%

all over the world the lisban facility
 
01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
is quite large contains over five acres
 
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
of buildings we heat our buildings and
 
01:52:58.069 --> 01:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
dry kils solely with wood waste from our
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
operation and locally sourced wood chips
 
01:53:04.030 --> 01:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
we use zero fossil
 
01:53:06.910 --> 01:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
fuels until last year we had two
 
01:53:10.270 --> 01:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
Woodfired boilers but under pressure
 
01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Dees we were
 
01:53:17.189 --> 01:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
required to shut down one of the boilers
 
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
leaving us with a 40-year-old boiler and
 
01:53:23.069 --> 01:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
no backup for 2 years we have been
 
01:53:26.350 --> 01:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
working on a plan to replace the current
 
01:53:29.229 --> 01:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
inefficient boiler with a new high
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
efficiency boiler equipped with the
 
01:53:35.229 --> 01:53:35.239 align:start position:0%
latest technology for biomass combustion
 
01:53:35.239 --> 01:53:36.470 align:start position:0%
latest technology for biomass combustion

01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
30
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
seconds we have completed feasibility
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
studies and spend hours planning this is
 
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
a $2.8 million project and the company
 
01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
needs to obtain financing for the boiler
 
01:53:51.629 --> 01:53:51.639 align:start position:0%
T-Rex are critical to the success of the
 
01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
project and provided the ability for the
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
company to justify financing 15 seconds
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
T-Rex provides companies like mine
 
01:54:04.709 --> 01:54:04.719 align:start position:0%
hospitals and schools the incentive to
 
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
invest in clean renewable biomass
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
combustion in our case the new boiler if
 
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
we are successful in obtaining financing
 
01:54:17.189 --> 01:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
will remove over 20,000 pounds of
 
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
particulate annually from the atmosphere
 
01:54:22.830 --> 01:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and I urge you to vote against
 
01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
this will thank you very much Mr dicks
 
01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your testimony this
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
morning I now call
 
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
on uh Matt Ley Mr Ley you have two
 
01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
minutes uh good morning Mr chairman I
 
01:54:38.950 --> 01:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
will be less than that I hope you all
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
can hear me uh we did uh I'm this is
 
01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
Matt Ley I'm with the for society uh we
 
01:54:46.589 --> 01:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
did submit written testimony uh in
 
01:54:49.149 --> 01:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill if you didn't
 
01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
get it I'll be happy to resend it but
 
01:54:54.589 --> 01:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
just quickly our opposition to this bill
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
is based on the fundamental purpose of
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
the RPS which um as you know is to um
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
increase the use of local renewable
 
01:55:07.870 --> 01:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
fuels um and reduce the use of you know
 
01:55:10.069 --> 01:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
our dependence on fossil fuels and we
 
01:55:14.189 --> 01:55:14.199 align:start position:0%
just look at the um Bill's language you
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
know for example it's treatment of class
 
01:55:18.910 --> 01:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
one thermal um as in direct opposition
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know to the fundamental purpose of
 
01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the RPS and therefore we would ask
 
01:55:28.069 --> 01:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
you to um oppose its Bill thank you
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate uh your being
 
01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
brief we'll next call on Mr Derek
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
Freeland Mr Freeland you have two
 
01:55:39.229 --> 01:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
minutes uh good morning Mr chair ladies
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
and gentlemen of the committee uh thank
 
01:55:42.910 --> 01:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to speak today
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
my name is Derek furland I'm the County
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
Manager for Sullivan County and on
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Board of Commissioners I'm
 
01:55:50.669 --> 01:55:50.679 align:start position:0%
testifying today in opposition of HB
 
01:55:54.430 --> 01:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
2113 Sullivan would lose $100,000 a year
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
in Revenue which would most likely be
 
01:55:59.310 --> 01:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
offset by higher property taxes Sullivan
 
01:56:00.990 --> 01:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
County's taxpayers are not alone in this
 
01:56:03.709 --> 01:56:03.719 align:start position:0%
regard as chesher marac and Rockingham
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
counties also have biomass plants and
 
01:56:08.430 --> 01:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
generate s similar
 
01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
revenues uh since 2014 when Sullivan
 
01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
County invested $3.4 million to convert
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
to biomass for heat we have saved
 
01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars buying
 
01:56:21.669 --> 01:56:21.679 align:start position:0%
wood chips compared to fuel oil in 2019
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
however we invested Ed another $300,000
 
01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
to reduce our particulate emissions in
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
order to qualify for T-Rex T-Rex have
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
provided the financial incentive to make
 
01:56:34.189 --> 01:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
these Investments therefore we should
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
consider the RPS as an investment not a
 
01:56:40.189 --> 01:56:40.199 align:start position:0%
subsidy New Hampshire consumers spend
 
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
over $600 million annually on fuel oil
 
01:56:46.030 --> 01:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
and the T-Rex portion of the RPS drives
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
investment in biomass systems which
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
helps capture a greater share of this
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
heating oil Market
 
01:56:54.589 --> 01:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
nothing says Made in New Hampshire like
 
01:56:56.589 --> 01:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
wood chips they are locally produced
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
locally processed and locally
 
01:57:02.350 --> 01:57:02.360 align:start position:0%
transported uh T-Rex are a strategic
 
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
Catalyst for New Hampshire's economy by
 
01:57:06.069 --> 01:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
providing markets for low-grade wood
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
products and incentives to proactively
 
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
manage our forests sound Forest
 
01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
management as we heard last week
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
decreases the risk of wildfires which
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
would be devastating to New Hampshire's
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
tourism economy between the jobs that
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
are created and sustained due to the
 
01:57:21.629 --> 01:57:21.639 align:start position:0%
demand for wood chips and the
 
01:57:23.149 --> 01:57:23.159 align:start position:0%
preservation of our natural resources
 
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
that impacts tourism T-Rex are the very
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
definition of a strategic asset
 
01:57:31.709 --> 01:57:31.719 align:start position:0%
including T-Rex in the RPS is good
 
01:57:33.790 --> 01:57:33.800 align:start position:0%
policy for New Hampshire in fact we
 
01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
should be doing more not less to try and
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
capture a greater share of the annual
 
01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
$600 million 80% of which leaves New
 
01:57:42.990 --> 01:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and benefits others
 
01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.669 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and benefits others
grandfathering

01:57:44.669 --> 01:57:44.679 align:start position:0%
grandfathering
 
01:57:47.229 --> 01:57:47.239 align:start position:0%
exist thank you very much for being here
 
01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
today and for
 
01:57:51.709 --> 01:57:51.719 align:start position:0%
testifying uh I'll next call on Heidi
 
01:57:51.719 --> 01:57:52.709 align:start position:0%
testifying uh I'll next call on Heidi
Crow

01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
Crow
 
01:57:55.589 --> 01:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
Miss croll if you could uh keep Mr
 
01:57:58.270 --> 01:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
chairman really I must protest we were
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
asked to delay our questions from one
 
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
speaker to another that speaker we would
 
01:58:06.270 --> 01:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
no questions were taken no questions
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
have been taken on the last I think it's
 
01:58:11.870 --> 01:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
four speakers if we need more time we
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
can this hard stop at 12 o'clock is
 
01:58:17.470 --> 01:58:17.480 align:start position:0%
purely artificial we can move we can
 
01:58:20.229 --> 01:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
move further this testimony is important
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
and I I really do think that you're not
 
01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
treating our the the public and the
 
01:58:26.830 --> 01:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
members who have come forward to speak
 
01:58:29.069 --> 01:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
to us in a respectful fashion by
 
01:58:31.069 --> 01:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
treating them in such an Abrupt and
 
01:58:32.910 --> 01:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
off-hand fashion thank you for
 
01:58:35.790 --> 01:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
registering your point of order I will
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
tell you that for the members who have a
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
hard stop at 12 o'clock it's not
 
01:58:42.990 --> 01:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
arbitrary they have reasons why they
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
have a hard stop there are members of
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
this committee sitting here in this room
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
who work and they have obligations to
 
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
their employers so it's it's not an
 
01:58:55.589 --> 01:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
arbitrary hard stop it's a real hard
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
Stop Now by uh introducing this point of
 
01:59:03.310 --> 01:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
order discussion into the into the mix
 
01:59:06.669 --> 01:59:06.679 align:start position:0%
you have uh prevented several people
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
from being a able to
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
testify because now we've reached our
 
01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
hard stock so I hope you feel good about
 
01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to uh recess this public
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
hearing and we'll talk later about when
 
01:59:24.270 --> 01:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
and if it ever resumes so thank you
 
01:59:25.629 --> 01:59:25.639 align:start position:0%
right now and we'll see you at one
 
01:59:27.550 --> 01:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
o'clock Mr chairman I don't see any
 
01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
reason why you couldn't resume at 1
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
o'clock why you couldn't recess this
 
01:59:34.430 --> 01:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
hearing and resume again at one o'clock
 
01:59:38.069 --> 01:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
for another 10 minutes or so right house
 
01:59:41.069 --> 01:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
rules state that if you re recess a
 
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
public hearing and resume it you have to
 
01:59:46.069 --> 01:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
give it a Time certain so we have to
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
resume the public hearing at for HB 315
 
01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock time you can resume it
 
01:59:54.990 --> 01:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
and then postpone it right just like you
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
do with other hearings we could resume
 
01:59:59.470 --> 01:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
it and then recess it I'll doing that at
 
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
one o'clock but not until then so we'll
 
02:00:04.629 --> 02:00:04.639 align:start position:0%
see you at one o'clock take care making
 
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
this up so what are people to understand
 
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
about whether they should come back to
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
testify on 2113 I don't I don't
 
02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:20.069 align:start position:0%
 
saying

02:00:20.069 --> 02:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:00:23.109 --> 02:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
okay I guess people get no Direction I
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%

02:00:46.030 --> 02:00:46.040 align:start position:0%

are we un
 
02:57:38.910 --> 02:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
muted yes okay yes you may ask a
 
02:57:42.190 --> 02:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um I got
 
02:57:44.630 --> 02:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
a note over lunch period saying that
 
02:57:47.229 --> 02:57:47.239 align:start position:0%
both of the links in the calendar to our
 
02:57:50.630 --> 02:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
to our 11 and our 1M sessions that were
 
02:57:53.349 --> 02:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
added both of the links were not working
 
02:57:54.950 --> 02:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
for the public so I just wanted you to
 
02:57:56.510 --> 02:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
be aware of that I wasn't sure if you
 
02:57:56.520 --> 02:57:57.590 align:start position:0%
be aware of that I wasn't sure if you
had

02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:58:01.510 --> 02:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
heard yes I did hear I just got email
 
02:58:05.110 --> 02:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
from HCS which is house Community
 
02:58:10.190 --> 02:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
Services yep and they Pro provided a
 
02:58:14.870 --> 02:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
updated link to Mr C Clifton vo okay I
 
02:58:17.710 --> 02:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if they have fixed it on the
 
02:58:19.550 --> 02:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
house calendar or
 
02:58:22.830 --> 02:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
not but they're aware of it and so
 
02:58:26.830 --> 02:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
they're trying to make people hold okay
 
02:58:47.030 --> 02:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:25.190 --> 02:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:29.269 --> 02:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative mgee uh Mr Belo is now
 
02:59:32.030 --> 02:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
online so apparently the revised link
 
02:59:34.670 --> 02:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
that he was sent is
 
02:59:38.110 --> 02:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
working and uh I would trust that
 
02:59:41.990 --> 02:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else who has contacted
 
02:59:46.510 --> 02:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
HCS has also received a updated link
 
02:59:48.710 --> 02:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
that works so hopefully
 
02:59:50.710 --> 02:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
everybody who wants to be on the on the
 
02:59:58.510 --> 02:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:03.830 --> 03:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
point okay so it is uh one o'clock
 
03:00:08.630 --> 03:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
and I would like to uh remind everybody
 
03:00:12.670 --> 03:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
that at 12 o'clock I recessed I did not
 
03:00:17.269 --> 03:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
conclude I did not adjourn HB 23's
 
03:00:20.469 --> 03:00:20.479 align:start position:0%
public hearing I recessed it and we will
 
03:00:25.469 --> 03:00:25.479 align:start position:0%
now resume the public hearing on HB
 
03:00:28.389 --> 03:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
213 and after consultation with the
 
03:00:31.429 --> 03:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
house clerk I have determined that we
 
03:00:34.750 --> 03:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
can finish this public hearing before we
 
03:00:37.269 --> 03:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
have to open the public hearing on HB
 
03:00:41.309 --> 03:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
315 so we will do that uh at the
 
03:00:45.309 --> 03:00:45.319 align:start position:0%
conclusion of the public hearing on
 
03:00:50.590 --> 03:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
hb2 213 so that I will call on Heidi
 
03:00:53.670 --> 03:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
Crow and Miss Crow I will give you two
 
03:00:55.910 --> 03:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
minutes to make a
 
03:00:57.950 --> 03:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
presentation thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:00:59.150 --> 03:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh good
 
03:01:01.349 --> 03:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh for the record my name is
 
03:01:03.389 --> 03:01:03.399 align:start position:0%
Heidi croll I'm testifying today on
 
03:01:05.590 --> 03:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Granite State Hydro Power
 
03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
Association um I did submit written
 
03:01:11.349 --> 03:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
testimony um gsha is opposed to um House
 
03:01:13.950 --> 03:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 213 and would respectfully urge the
 
03:01:15.870 --> 03:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
committee to find it inexpedient to
 
03:01:18.309 --> 03:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
legislate um we're opposing because it
 
03:01:22.110 --> 03:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
will undermine the um RPS program um and
 
03:01:25.870 --> 03:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
while um so 213 would lower the
 
03:01:28.670 --> 03:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
percentage requirement for class one and
 
03:01:30.510 --> 03:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
while existing Hydro facilities are not
 
03:01:33.229 --> 03:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
typically associated with class one um
 
03:01:36.469 --> 03:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
there are about uh five or six um of New
 
03:01:38.269 --> 03:01:38.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's smallscale Hydro facilities
 
03:01:40.309 --> 03:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
that are eligible to participate to some
 
03:01:41.910 --> 03:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
extent in class one because they
 
03:01:44.670 --> 03:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
completed uh Capital Investments such as
 
03:01:46.630 --> 03:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
efficiency improvements or additions of
 
03:01:49.269 --> 03:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
capacity um that resulted in incremental
 
03:01:52.830 --> 03:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
new production of electricity um so the
 
03:01:55.269 --> 03:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
proposal in house bille 213 to lower the
 
03:01:58.190 --> 03:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
class One requirement to 6% um per
 
03:02:00.070 --> 03:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
compliance year would uh negatively
 
03:02:02.910 --> 03:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
impact the class one um wreck Market by
 
03:02:05.190 --> 03:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
causing the value of um class one rexs
 
03:02:08.429 --> 03:02:08.439 align:start position:0%
to um to drop substantially and in turn
 
03:02:10.550 --> 03:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
um harm the ongoing economic viability
 
03:02:12.630 --> 03:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
of the existing um smallscale Hydro
 
03:02:14.150 --> 03:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
facilities that are participating in
 
03:02:17.269 --> 03:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
class one um New Hampshire class 1 Rex
 
03:02:19.389 --> 03:02:19.399 align:start position:0%
provided much provide much needed
 
03:02:20.950 --> 03:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
financial support to the ongoing
 
03:02:23.070 --> 03:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
operation of several um of New
 
03:02:26.150 --> 03:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's uh hydroelectric projects uh
 
03:02:28.429 --> 03:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
whose owners decisions to upgrade their
 
03:02:30.950 --> 03:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
Hydro facilities included um you know
 
03:02:32.590 --> 03:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
some some trust I guess that the
 
03:02:34.950 --> 03:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
legislators uh or legislature would not
 
03:02:38.750 --> 03:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
um 30 seconds destabilize the state's
 
03:02:42.510 --> 03:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
RPS program um with that I will um seed
 
03:02:45.590 --> 03:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
the rest of my time to uh other speakers
 
03:02:48.469 --> 03:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
we appreciate it um and uh thank you for
 
03:02:51.190 --> 03:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony and again we are um
 
03:02:53.790 --> 03:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
support uh an itl motion on House Bill
 
03:02:57.990 --> 03:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
213 thank you thank you Miss Crow
 
03:03:00.550 --> 03:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative s samich is recognized
 
03:03:01.910 --> 03:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
for a
 
03:03:04.670 --> 03:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:03:10.269 --> 03:03:10.279 align:start position:0%
Miss Crow um you tell me if if um HB
 
03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
2113 were P what do you see as the
 
03:03:17.990 --> 03:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
consequences for your members in as are
 
03:03:21.830 --> 03:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:24.750 --> 03:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
future well like I said there there are
 
03:03:27.429 --> 03:03:27.439 align:start position:0%
um about you know half a dozen or so
 
03:03:30.510 --> 03:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
smallscale Hydro facilities that have um
 
03:03:35.150 --> 03:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
made um upgrades to their facilities um
 
03:03:37.950 --> 03:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
that and that marginal um additional
 
03:03:40.590 --> 03:03:40.600 align:start position:0%
output that those upgrades um produced
 
03:03:42.950 --> 03:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
if you will uh that's the piece that's
 
03:03:45.830 --> 03:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
um eligible for for class one and so
 
03:03:48.550 --> 03:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
those um Investments were made
 
03:03:51.630 --> 03:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
um with the understanding that um you
 
03:03:53.950 --> 03:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
know the class one recck market would
 
03:03:57.469 --> 03:03:57.479 align:start position:0%
kind of um not be disrupted um you know
 
03:04:00.910 --> 03:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
in addition I think uh so so you know
 
03:04:03.269 --> 03:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
one there's there's uh Investments kind
 
03:04:05.469 --> 03:04:05.479 align:start position:0%
of hanging in the balance there um and
 
03:04:07.389 --> 03:04:07.399 align:start position:0%
in addition I you know would just say
 
03:04:09.269 --> 03:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
that in general small scale Hydro
 
03:04:11.269 --> 03:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
facilities um they're they're FK
 
03:04:13.030 --> 03:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
regulated they're uh regulated by the
 
03:04:15.590 --> 03:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission um
 
03:04:18.110 --> 03:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
they uh have to adhere to a very high
 
03:04:20.590 --> 03:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
standard of Maintenance and um
 
03:04:23.070 --> 03:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
documentation um you know they they are
 
03:04:25.510 --> 03:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
subject to the same uh firk requirements
 
03:04:27.790 --> 03:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
that a larger scale Hydro facilities are
 
03:04:28.910 --> 03:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
but of course they don't have the
 
03:04:30.750 --> 03:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
economies of scale that the larger ones
 
03:04:34.870 --> 03:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
do um they many projects are required to
 
03:04:37.309 --> 03:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
install and maintain um expensive um
 
03:04:41.269 --> 03:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
fish passage facilities um the latest uh
 
03:04:44.750 --> 03:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
has been um around eels um the eel
 
03:04:47.910 --> 03:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
passages are are very expensive um in
 
03:04:50.550 --> 03:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
some cases they are uh the hydro
 
03:04:52.389 --> 03:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
facilities are required to shut down
 
03:04:54.389 --> 03:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
generation for short periods of time to
 
03:04:57.070 --> 03:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
allow the safe passage um Downstream
 
03:05:01.670 --> 03:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
passage of eels um so um I think to
 
03:05:03.990 --> 03:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
answer your your question uh you know
 
03:05:07.309 --> 03:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
the RPS plays a very um important role
 
03:05:09.070 --> 03:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
to hydro uh
 
03:05:11.469 --> 03:05:11.479 align:start position:0%
projects who are you know especially the
 
03:05:13.269 --> 03:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
small scale run of river ones that are
 
03:05:15.429 --> 03:05:15.439 align:start position:0%
sensitive to annual variations in
 
03:05:18.349 --> 03:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
wholesale Energy prices and and also um
 
03:05:20.349 --> 03:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
water flow you know we had a drought
 
03:05:22.469 --> 03:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
this year so their revenue is down
 
03:05:24.110 --> 03:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
because their generation was
 
03:05:28.269 --> 03:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
down thank you thank you miss croll
 
03:05:30.309 --> 03:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions for Miss
 
03:05:33.349 --> 03:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
croll I'll call on our next speaker who
 
03:05:36.429 --> 03:05:36.439 align:start position:0%
is Charlie Marino Mr Marino you have the
 
03:05:38.269 --> 03:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
floor for two
 
03:05:40.830 --> 03:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chairman can you
 
03:05:42.950 --> 03:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
03:05:46.429 --> 03:05:46.439 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you I'm uh Charlie Moreno
 
03:05:48.309 --> 03:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
from straford New Hampshire and today
 
03:05:51.070 --> 03:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
I'm focusing on how anti-b business and
 
03:05:54.830 --> 03:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
economically devastating HB 213 is I
 
03:05:56.870 --> 03:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
present my business as an example of the
 
03:05:58.550 --> 03:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
hundreds of forest industry businesses
 
03:06:00.750 --> 03:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
in the state I started my business
 
03:06:04.710 --> 03:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
Moreno forestry in 1980 when I was 21
 
03:06:06.870 --> 03:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
years old and have operated successfully
 
03:06:09.670 --> 03:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
for over 40 years our sustainably
 
03:06:12.910 --> 03:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
managed forests in the Sea Coast Area
 
03:06:15.030 --> 03:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
produce about 4,000 trailer loads of
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
wood annually parked end to end this
 
03:06:19.990 --> 03:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
line of trailer trucks would be over 50
 
03:06:22.630 --> 03:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
miles long two-thirds of these trucks
 
03:06:25.710 --> 03:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
are filled with chipwood and HP 2113
 
03:06:28.110 --> 03:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
would be devastating to our business in
 
03:06:30.349 --> 03:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
40 Years of business I've never received
 
03:06:32.030 --> 03:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
a dime of financial assistance from the
 
03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire nor would I want
 
03:06:36.349 --> 03:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
any and like a thousand or so other
 
03:06:38.830 --> 03:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
Forest industry businesses in the state
 
03:06:42.630 --> 03:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
we all deliver jobs taxes and robust

Harrington's misinformed attack on the
 
03:06:54.510 --> 03:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
forest industry starts off with
 
03:06:57.670 --> 03:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
mischaracterizing the rec credits as a
 
03:07:00.469 --> 03:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
subsidy Rec credits are not a subsidy in
 
03:07:02.710 --> 03:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
my opinion they are earned by the
 
03:07:04.710 --> 03:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
biomass plants for investing and
 
03:07:07.870 --> 03:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
producing Power by renewable means the
 
03:07:10.429 --> 03:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
use of the term subsidy disparages the
 
03:07:12.990 --> 03:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
forest industry which is an industry
 
03:07:15.710 --> 03:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
that is staunchly independent and
 
03:07:18.110 --> 03:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
self-reliant this industry contributes
 
03:07:20.469 --> 03:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
jobs taxes and economic wealth to New
 
03:07:23.110 --> 03:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's econ economy to the tune of
 
03:07:26.550 --> 03:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
$250 million 30
 
03:07:28.790 --> 03:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
second not much has been said about the
 
03:07:30.710 --> 03:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
90,000 Forest land owners in New
 
03:07:33.630 --> 03:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that this bill hurts this loss
 
03:07:35.630 --> 03:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's wood energy plants is
 
03:07:38.590 --> 03:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
an automatic 25% discount on the timber
 
03:07:40.910 --> 03:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
value of most people's wood Lots many of
 
03:07:43.469 --> 03:07:43.479 align:start position:0%
these land owners provide free hunting
 
03:07:45.630 --> 03:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
snowmobiling and Hiking as well as water
 
03:07:47.910 --> 03:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
and air quality benefits and they don't
 
03:07:49.990 --> 03:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
get compensation at all this bill
 
03:07:52.910 --> 03:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
creates a huge financial setback to hter
 
03:07:54.590 --> 03:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
land owners and it makes mockery of
 
03:07:56.710 --> 03:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
their enormous generosity in providing
 
03:07:58.429 --> 03:07:58.439 align:start position:0%
free public access to their private
 
03:08:00.870 --> 03:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
Forest as a New Hampshire business owner
 
03:08:02.870 --> 03:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'm here to ask that you not support
 
03:08:05.830 --> 03:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
this poorly conceed bill it's anti- jobs
 
03:08:08.750 --> 03:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
anti-land owner and anti Forest please
 
03:08:12.389 --> 03:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
support CZ and land owners and vote this
 
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
down thank you Mr chairman Mr
 
03:08:21.469 --> 03:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:24.590 --> 03:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
um representative pimel is recognized
 
03:08:26.870 --> 03:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
for a
 
03:08:29.710 --> 03:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:08:34.830 --> 03:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Moreno for being here to uh
 
03:08:36.389 --> 03:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
discuss this
 
03:08:41.309 --> 03:08:41.319 align:start position:0%
issue one of the questions I have is uh
 
03:08:45.910 --> 03:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
basically the what impact this will have
 
03:08:48.269 --> 03:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
to the uh
 
03:08:52.309 --> 03:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
the lowgrade wood market and what impact
 
03:08:55.990 --> 03:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
that will have on the state in general
 
03:08:59.190 --> 03:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about uh forestry
 
03:08:59.200 --> 03:09:00.750 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about uh forestry
management

03:09:00.750 --> 03:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
management
 
03:09:03.190 --> 03:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
um uh sports
 
03:09:10.670 --> 03:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:13.670 --> 03:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
Etc uh yes thank you representative it's
 
03:09:16.910 --> 03:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
devastating um our forest management and
 
03:09:21.110 --> 03:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
our for depend on maintenance as has
 
03:09:22.870 --> 03:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
been stated before by several other
 
03:09:25.030 --> 03:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
speakers and without this lowgrade
 
03:09:27.670 --> 03:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
Market the chipwood market is absolutely
 
03:09:30.030 --> 03:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
critical um as you can see two-thirds of
 
03:09:33.910 --> 03:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
our forest products are are that um
 
03:09:36.670 --> 03:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
without that market our forest would be
 
03:09:39.349 --> 03:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh just a Haven for the insects that are
 
03:09:42.790 --> 03:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
are attacking it right now um for uh
 
03:09:45.110 --> 03:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
we've heard of the fire dangers and
 
03:09:47.349 --> 03:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
there's no way we can grow better
 
03:09:49.630 --> 03:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
healthier forest or or the uh or
 
03:09:52.830 --> 03:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
provides the habitat benefits that we do
 
03:09:55.830 --> 03:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
um this is vast we we'd be losing that
 
03:09:59.469 --> 03:09:59.479 align:start position:0%
so I really urge you not to support this
 
03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
bill follow up Mr chairman follow up so
 
03:10:08.110 --> 03:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
the other question I have concerns the
 
03:10:12.910 --> 03:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh the lumber Market how will that
 
03:10:17.110 --> 03:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
affect uh the timber industry as far as
 
03:10:20.710 --> 03:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh harvestable Lumber and how they deal
 
03:10:24.750 --> 03:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
with u basically a product that is all
 
03:10:27.110 --> 03:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
of a sudden of no
 
03:10:29.469 --> 03:10:29.479 align:start position:0%
value if if we no longer have the
 
03:10:31.469 --> 03:10:31.479 align:start position:0%
chipwood market you're going to see just
 
03:10:33.269 --> 03:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
High grading of the forest the only
 
03:10:35.590 --> 03:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
thing that's you know worth cutting is
 
03:10:38.309 --> 03:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
is good trees and the poor quality trees
 
03:10:42.790 --> 03:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
are left um and that'll be a long-term
 
03:10:44.750 --> 03:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
effect negative effect to our forest
 
03:10:48.510 --> 03:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty huge um the the lumber
 
03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
industry um if if there is any kind of
 
03:10:54.870 --> 03:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
low-grade Market
 
03:10:58.510 --> 03:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
um the the high-grade products will be
 
03:11:01.190 --> 03:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
subsidizing the cost of removing that
 
03:11:03.790 --> 03:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
low-grade product um so land owners will
 
03:11:06.950 --> 03:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
lose once again with lower Timber prices
 
03:11:09.590 --> 03:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
and um the Sawmills themselves need a
 
03:11:12.710 --> 03:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
home for the chipwood that they generate
 
03:11:15.269 --> 03:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
when they saw Lumber they end up with
 
03:11:17.910 --> 03:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
slabwood and and edgings right now
 
03:11:22.469 --> 03:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
that's sold to uh chip plants um and
 
03:11:24.389 --> 03:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
they will no longer really have a home
 
03:11:26.269 --> 03:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
for that so that's higher cost for them
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
as well so you just see a kind of a
 
03:11:31.030 --> 03:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
spiraling this is all connected it's a
 
03:11:33.710 --> 03:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
big Network um and the and the biomass
 
03:11:36.830 --> 03:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
plants are at the uh in the middle of
 
03:11:38.990 --> 03:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
all of this so to lose that will be
 
03:11:41.830 --> 03:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
devastating our our our industry is
 
03:11:46.510 --> 03:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
already pretty baguer and um and it's uh
 
03:11:48.990 --> 03:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
a big chunk of of our state's economy um
 
03:11:50.750 --> 03:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
and it has been for many many years I
 
03:11:53.790 --> 03:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's part of our our state's
 
03:11:56.389 --> 03:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
character this a direct attack which
 
03:11:59.110 --> 03:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
without really a full picture of the uh
 
03:12:01.150 --> 03:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
the overall
 
03:12:04.389 --> 03:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
consequence okay Maro thank you Mr
 
03:12:07.469 --> 03:12:07.479 align:start position:0%
Marino before I recognize the next
 
03:12:10.790 --> 03:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
questioner I want to announce to those
 
03:12:14.670 --> 03:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
who are waiting that the public hearing
 
03:12:16.229 --> 03:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
the resumption of the public hearing on
 
03:12:20.830 --> 03:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
hb31 15 will'll start as soon as we
 
03:12:23.710 --> 03:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
finish questioning Mr Marino who appears
 
03:12:26.950 --> 03:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
to be the last speaker for HB 213 so
 
03:12:28.990 --> 03:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
with that I recognize representative
 
03:12:30.830 --> 03:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
McGee for a
 
03:12:33.349 --> 03:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
03:12:37.550 --> 03:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
Mr Moreno um my question is around
 
03:12:39.389 --> 03:12:39.399 align:start position:0%
something you said I was taking notes
 
03:12:42.229 --> 03:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
and um you mentioned the
 
03:12:44.269 --> 03:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
mischaracterization of the Rex as a
 
03:12:46.670 --> 03:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
subsidy and as I look at some of the
 
03:12:49.870 --> 03:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
bills that we have that I as I look at
 
03:12:51.630 --> 03:12:51.640 align:start position:0%
them I'm trying to figure out what
 
03:12:53.309 --> 03:12:53.319 align:start position:0%
problem we're trying to
 
03:12:56.870 --> 03:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
solve um this is one of those bills and
 
03:12:59.229 --> 03:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
so my question to you is could you say a
 
03:13:01.510 --> 03:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
little bit more about how you see the
 
03:13:04.950 --> 03:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
Rex in terms of you've mentioned all the
 
03:13:06.670 --> 03:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
different Downstream benefits that you
 
03:13:09.070 --> 03:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
see uh the New Hampshire economy
 
03:13:11.309 --> 03:13:11.319 align:start position:0%
deriving but can you say a little bit
 
03:13:14.190 --> 03:13:14.200 align:start position:0%
more about how subsidy might not be the
 
03:13:17.630 --> 03:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
right way to look at it
 
03:13:20.590 --> 03:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
it's um yeah it's these are incentives
 
03:13:24.110 --> 03:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
for um power power plants that are
 
03:13:26.349 --> 03:13:26.359 align:start position:0%
polluting that are using non-renewables
 
03:13:30.030 --> 03:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
to to come around and and um change that
 
03:13:31.590 --> 03:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
because this is good for the uh for the
 
03:13:33.190 --> 03:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
environment it's good for our state and
 
03:13:35.190 --> 03:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
in so many ways that speaker after
 
03:13:37.590 --> 03:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
speaker have have delivered today and
 
03:13:41.190 --> 03:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
the other day um it's an incentive and
 
03:13:45.030 --> 03:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
those incentive pay payments go to the
 
03:13:47.349 --> 03:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
the energy producers that are in fact
 
03:13:50.150 --> 03:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
investing in and producing the renewable
 
03:13:54.309 --> 03:13:54.319 align:start position:0%
energy power which has so many spin-off
 
03:13:57.670 --> 03:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
benefits not not only to our uh economy
 
03:13:58.830 --> 03:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
but to our
 
03:14:01.030 --> 03:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
environment this is these are long-term
 
03:14:02.469 --> 03:14:02.479 align:start position:0%
consequences that we need to be thinking
 
03:14:02.479 --> 03:14:04.590 align:start position:0%
consequences that we need to be thinking
about

03:14:04.590 --> 03:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
today yes I wouldn't call this at all
 
03:14:09.910 --> 03:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a credit and these are
 
03:14:14.910 --> 03:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
earned by our um our our wood wood
 
03:14:17.550 --> 03:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
energy plants they're earned
 
03:14:21.309 --> 03:14:21.319 align:start position:0%
would you also uh when you say it's a
 
03:14:24.550 --> 03:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
earned credit there's also the local
 
03:14:26.309 --> 03:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
diversity I mean those are the things
 
03:14:28.630 --> 03:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
that come into play in my mind in terms
 
03:14:33.309 --> 03:14:33.319 align:start position:0%
of the aspect that the thermal uh Rec
 
03:14:35.429 --> 03:14:35.439 align:start position:0%
system plays that might be distinct from
 
03:14:38.670 --> 03:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
some of the others I mean it's local um
 
03:14:41.870 --> 03:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
and sustainable is that a question yeah
 
03:14:43.229 --> 03:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
well I'm trying to trying to get to the
 
03:14:46.110 --> 03:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
question because you know this idea that
 
03:14:48.229 --> 03:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
the the benefits are difficult for us
 
03:14:50.510 --> 03:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
maybe to get our our heads around but
 
03:14:53.750 --> 03:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
there are significant benefits that are
 
03:14:56.190 --> 03:14:56.200 align:start position:0%
local and that means that we don't have
 
03:14:58.309 --> 03:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
to send those dollars out of state they
 
03:14:59.990 --> 03:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
generate money
 
03:15:02.469 --> 03:15:02.479 align:start position:0%
here right I I guess the bottom line is
 
03:15:04.469 --> 03:15:04.479 align:start position:0%
I think it's disparaging to our industry
 
03:15:06.309 --> 03:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
to call this a subsidy our industry
 
03:15:08.309 --> 03:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't look for handouts people are are
 
03:15:10.429 --> 03:15:10.439 align:start position:0%
self-reliant they're independent
 
03:15:13.229 --> 03:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs um and they help the local
 
03:15:15.510 --> 03:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
economy in a in a huge way they're part
 
03:15:17.870 --> 03:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
of the web so we're we're not looking
 
03:15:18.990 --> 03:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
for handouts and I think it's
 
03:15:20.950 --> 03:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
disparaging to use the word subsidy when
 
03:15:23.670 --> 03:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
this is in fact a credit that is earned
 
03:15:28.030 --> 03:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
by the biomass plants I'm I'm not as uh
 
03:15:30.510 --> 03:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
up on the thermal part of it um other
 
03:15:32.590 --> 03:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
than I know that there's local like
 
03:15:36.349 --> 03:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
schools and and um the County Farms that
 
03:15:38.309 --> 03:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
have invested millions of dollars into
 
03:15:41.750 --> 03:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
into building small biomass plants um to
 
03:15:43.910 --> 03:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
to produce renewable energy once again
 
03:15:45.349 --> 03:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
and this all ties into the forest
 
03:15:45.359 --> 03:15:47.150 align:start position:0%
and this all ties into the forest
industry

03:15:47.150 --> 03:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
industry
 
03:15:50.229 --> 03:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you okay thank you for
 
03:15:53.910 --> 03:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
that uh that answer before I call on the
 
03:15:56.590 --> 03:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
next questioner for Mr Marino I would
 
03:16:00.429 --> 03:16:00.439 align:start position:0%
like to ask a question of Representative
 
03:16:02.590 --> 03:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
Harrington representative Harrington I
 
03:16:06.229 --> 03:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
was reading your amendment to HB
 
03:16:10.269 --> 03:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
213 and it says on line five that it
 
03:16:13.550 --> 03:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
amends the bill by replacing all after
 
03:16:17.830 --> 03:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
the enacting Clause with the following
 
03:16:22.550 --> 03:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:22.560 --> 03:16:26.030 align:start position:0%
 
repes

03:16:26.030 --> 03:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:29.389 --> 03:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
thees of the original
 
03:16:32.429 --> 03:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
Bill and then it it excuse me Mr
 
03:16:33.630 --> 03:16:33.640 align:start position:0%
chairman can you give me a second I got
 
03:16:44.469 --> 03:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:46.189 --> 03:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
locations I'm going to thank
 
03:16:50.349 --> 03:16:50.359 align:start position:0%
representative bares me for uh noticing
 
03:16:53.070 --> 03:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
what appears to be a discrepancy here
 
03:16:55.070 --> 03:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to
 
03:16:57.870 --> 03:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
verify that it is a discrepancy and not
 
03:16:57.880 --> 03:17:00.150 align:start position:0%
verify that it is a discrepancy and not
your

03:17:00.150 --> 03:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:17:07.150 --> 03:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:10.309 --> 03:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
am while we're while we're waiting Mr Mr
 
03:17:11.910 --> 03:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
chair it appears there's two Sor about
 
03:17:14.870 --> 03:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
the delay back hands up in the attendees
 
03:17:18.590 --> 03:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
list to speak I think
 
03:17:21.590 --> 03:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh okay are you ready to
 
03:17:23.469 --> 03:17:23.479 align:start position:0%
answer a question yes yes I am I have
 
03:17:25.550 --> 03:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment in front of me now so the
 
03:17:28.429 --> 03:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
amendment says in line five amend the
 
03:17:31.710 --> 03:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
bill by replacing all after the enacting
 
03:17:34.550 --> 03:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
Clause with the
 
03:17:38.630 --> 03:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
F does that it this amendment replaces
 
03:17:41.389 --> 03:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
the entire Bill no that's I'm sorry that
 
03:17:43.550 --> 03:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
was a mistake I don't know that was a
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
miscommunication between uh legislative
 
03:17:47.469 --> 03:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
services and myself
 
03:17:48.870 --> 03:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
the only thing that should have been
 
03:17:51.630 --> 03:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
changed is the wording on lines 10 and
 
03:17:53.950 --> 03:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
11 so I'll have to go back to them and
 
03:17:55.670 --> 03:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
get that fixed that was not the intent
 
03:17:58.630 --> 03:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
of the bill it was simply to grandfather
 
03:18:01.670 --> 03:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
in the thermal energy that's being used
 
03:18:05.110 --> 03:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
for Rex prior to January 1st 2020 it was
 
03:18:06.630 --> 03:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
not to replace the entire Bill thank you
 
03:18:08.429 --> 03:18:08.439 align:start position:0%
for catching that it was a mistake on my
 
03:18:11.309 --> 03:18:11.319 align:start position:0%
part thank representative Bry for
 
03:18:14.590 --> 03:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
catching that mistake okay thank you you
 
03:18:17.110 --> 03:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
will be getting a new Amendment then
 
03:18:18.670 --> 03:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll go right back to him and let
 
03:18:20.990 --> 03:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
him know oops uh oh people can you still
 
03:18:23.229 --> 03:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
hear me because you just disappeared yes
 
03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
we can still hear okay all right I can't
 
03:18:28.429 --> 03:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
see you anymore I don't know what's
 
03:18:30.389 --> 03:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
going on here anyways if you can still
 
03:18:31.750 --> 03:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
hear me yeah I'll go back to legislative
 
03:18:34.229 --> 03:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
services this afternoon and get that
 
03:18:36.550 --> 03:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
fixed okay great thank you for
 
03:18:40.189 --> 03:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
clarifying that uh now I'll call on
 
03:18:43.910 --> 03:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
recognize representative samich for a
 
03:18:46.229 --> 03:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:18:47.229 --> 03:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
03:18:50.349 --> 03:18:50.359 align:start position:0%
Moreno um how to make this I don't know
 
03:18:52.189 --> 03:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
if you're the right person to ask this
 
03:18:56.030 --> 03:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
but you probably can answer it um my
 
03:18:58.550 --> 03:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
understanding was that the biomass
 
03:19:01.710 --> 03:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
plants in general uh not only do they
 
03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
produce energy and so forth but the the
 
03:19:07.550 --> 03:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
byproduct after the combustion is wood
 
03:19:10.630 --> 03:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
ash which has become a pro commodity for
 
03:19:12.630 --> 03:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
the agricultural industry is that
 
03:19:12.640 --> 03:19:16.870 align:start position:0%
the agricultural industry is that
correct

03:19:16.870 --> 03:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:20.750 --> 03:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
know um representative ssuch do you have
 
03:19:24.309 --> 03:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
a question specific to the
 
03:19:27.670 --> 03:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
bill yes thank you uh Mr Sage can you
 
03:19:30.710 --> 03:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
hear me this this question goes right to
 
03:19:33.349 --> 03:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that this bill threatens that
 
03:19:36.070 --> 03:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
industry and that industry provides not
 
03:19:39.030 --> 03:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
only the the wood product but also
 
03:19:42.309 --> 03:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
provides a secondary market for the
 
03:19:42.319 --> 03:19:44.429 align:start position:0%
provides a secondary market for the
waste

03:19:44.429 --> 03:19:44.439 align:start position:0%
waste
 
03:19:46.870 --> 03:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't seem relevant to the
 
03:19:50.110 --> 03:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill uh producers of Ash
 
03:19:52.269 --> 03:19:52.279 align:start position:0%
don't get any renewable energy credits
 
03:19:52.279 --> 03:19:53.469 align:start position:0%
don't get any renewable energy credits
do

03:19:53.469 --> 03:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:19:56.990 --> 03:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
they well well no but but if but if the
 
03:19:59.389 --> 03:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
industry is shut down they won't have a
 
03:20:02.670 --> 03:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
product to sell so we have two other
 
03:20:04.910 --> 03:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
people who would like to speak so if we
 
03:20:07.389 --> 03:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
could try to confine our questions to
 
03:20:10.389 --> 03:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
the bill itself to help us understand
 
03:20:13.309 --> 03:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
whether the bill is uh appropriate or
 
03:20:15.150 --> 03:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
not that would be very helpful rather
 
03:20:17.950 --> 03:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
than having long and rambling
 
03:20:20.790 --> 03:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
discussions about the forest industry
 
03:20:23.750 --> 03:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
let's talk specifically about how the
 
03:20:27.950 --> 03:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
bill uh will affect directly affect the
 
03:20:30.630 --> 03:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
forest Product
 
03:20:33.070 --> 03:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
Industry well I'll withdraw my question
 
03:20:35.110 --> 03:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank
 
03:20:37.830 --> 03:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
you representative resent is recognized
 
03:20:39.750 --> 03:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:20:41.790 --> 03:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr Morana for your
 
03:20:44.070 --> 03:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
testimony uh my question is what are the

inefficiencies that prevent biomass
 
03:20:51.070 --> 03:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:55.070 --> 03:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
subsidy I'm not able to answer that
 
03:20:59.830 --> 03:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you okay thank you seeing
 
03:21:03.030 --> 03:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
no other questions for Mr Mareno I will
 
03:21:04.229 --> 03:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
now call
 
03:21:10.910 --> 03:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:13.870 --> 03:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you chairman Vose and
 
03:21:14.750 --> 03:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the
 
03:21:16.189 --> 03:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak on this bill our
 
03:21:18.349 --> 03:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard is a very
 
03:21:20.510 --> 03:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
important and the only policy to promote
 
03:21:22.150 --> 03:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
local renewable energy and fuel
 
03:21:24.349 --> 03:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
diversity fuel diversity helps to
 
03:21:26.309 --> 03:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
protect customers against price
 
03:21:29.349 --> 03:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
volatility and increases resilience our
 
03:21:32.229 --> 03:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
current goals in the RPS is to get 25%
 
03:21:34.110 --> 03:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
renewable energy by
 
03:21:37.950 --> 03:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
2025 HB 213 would reduce our goal for
 
03:21:40.910 --> 03:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
new Renewables by half affecting class
 
03:21:43.630 --> 03:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
one electric class one thermal class two
 
03:21:47.550 --> 03:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
solar and class three biomass Electric
 
03:21:49.429 --> 03:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
other states are ramping up their RPS
 
03:21:51.830 --> 03:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
goals and that's attracting investment
 
03:21:53.830 --> 03:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
and employment to their state to our
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
detriment it would be a mistake to lower
 
03:21:59.550 --> 03:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
our goals now I want to speak to um the
 
03:22:01.510 --> 03:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
class two solar goals since that hasn't
 
03:22:03.990 --> 03:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
been mentioned by other testimony before
 
03:22:06.830 --> 03:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
HB 213 would lower the goals back down
 
03:22:06.840 --> 03:22:08.070 align:start position:0%
HB 213 would lower the goals back down
to

03:22:08.070 --> 03:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:22:11.229 --> 03:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
0.3% that's completely unnecessary we
 
03:22:13.790 --> 03:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
already have about 0.8% of our
 
03:22:16.510 --> 03:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
electricity coming from solar sources so
 
03:22:18.630 --> 03:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
there's already an overabundance of Rex
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
in the market you've also heard from the
 
03:22:23.590 --> 03:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
Pu that there's a Rec sweeping free
 
03:22:25.750 --> 03:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
credit of
 
03:22:28.309 --> 03:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
0.4% that would be bigger than the goal
 
03:22:30.750 --> 03:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
if HB 213
 
03:22:33.110 --> 03:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
passed even with the amendment we would
 
03:22:34.950 --> 03:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
still oppose HB
 
03:22:34.960 --> 03:22:36.670 align:start position:0%
still oppose HB
213

03:22:36.670 --> 03:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
213
 
03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
um when you are paying your heating oil
 
03:22:43.030 --> 03:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
or propane Bill only about 22% of that
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
is going to our direct local economy
 
03:22:49.750 --> 03:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
when biomass fuels are purchased 90% of
 
03:22:51.950 --> 03:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
that spending goes directly to
 
03:22:54.110 --> 03:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
benefiting our local economy you've
 
03:22:55.990 --> 03:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
heard from many local government schools
 
03:22:57.870 --> 03:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
businesses that have invested in
 
03:23:00.150 --> 03:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
efficient wood pellet heating systems
 
03:23:02.590 --> 03:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
the benefits that has that that has had
 
03:23:04.229 --> 03:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
for both them and our forest products
 
03:23:06.670 --> 03:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
industry we ask that you not take that
 
03:23:09.189 --> 03:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity away from others to also
 
03:23:11.550 --> 03:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
have those same benefits thank you and
 
03:23:13.309 --> 03:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take
 
03:23:15.630 --> 03:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Miss Mano any
 
03:23:18.590 --> 03:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:21.750 --> 03:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
know seeing
 
03:23:24.830 --> 03:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
none there is one more hand rais but I'm
 
03:23:24.840 --> 03:23:27.269 align:start position:0%
none there is one more hand rais but I'm
reluctant

03:23:27.269 --> 03:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
reluctant
 
03:23:30.150 --> 03:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
to allow the person to speak because
 
03:23:34.229 --> 03:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
they are listed on my screen is having a
 
03:23:37.790 --> 03:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
name of Moto
 
03:23:41.790 --> 03:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
G parentheses 7 Clos parentheses
 
03:23:44.590 --> 03:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
play that doesn't that worries that's
 
03:23:47.349 --> 03:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
just a phone I know that individual
 
03:23:49.469 --> 03:23:49.479 align:start position:0%
that's a Bonafide
 
03:23:52.630 --> 03:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
address how do I know
 
03:23:55.910 --> 03:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
that I I've been in communication with I
 
03:23:57.510 --> 03:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
can't think of the person's name off the
 
03:24:00.309 --> 03:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
top of my head but I recognize the
 
03:24:04.910 --> 03:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:07.309 --> 03:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
Individual we have to know the name to
 
03:24:10.349 --> 03:24:10.359 align:start position:0%
be the name of a device and not a person
 
03:24:13.870 --> 03:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to recognize uh the
 
03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
same thing as a phone number those are
 
03:24:19.349 --> 03:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
also if the person wants to relog in as
 
03:24:21.870 --> 03:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
themselves then I'll allow don't have a
 
03:24:24.550 --> 03:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
way to do that logging in as a device is
 
03:24:27.630 --> 03:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
not appropriate in this setting so with
 
03:24:30.670 --> 03:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
that we can close finally the public
 
03:24:33.710 --> 03:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
03:24:36.710 --> 03:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
213 and I thank you all for
 
03:24:40.349 --> 03:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
participating and now we can

03:25:18.670 --> 03:25:18.680 align:start position:0%

does the major major changes in the

Clifton voo in both section six of the
 
03:28:45.269 --> 03:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
amendment and uh on line six and in most
 
03:28:48.150 --> 03:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:50.710 --> 03:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
it also adds a purchase of receivables
 
03:28:53.910 --> 03:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
provision that is optional not
 
03:28:57.349 --> 03:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
mandatory as requested by
 
03:29:00.030 --> 03:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
Liberty and it also adds a restriction
 
03:29:02.550 --> 03:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
on the imposition of exit fees in
 
03:29:06.030 --> 03:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
section six as suggested by Mark Brown
 
03:29:09.990 --> 03:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
of the consumer energy
 
03:29:12.710 --> 03:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
Alliance so if you have any specific
 
03:29:14.510 --> 03:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
questions about the amendment I will try
 
03:29:17.030 --> 03:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
to answer them I will tell you that the
 
03:29:19.229 --> 03:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
next person I'm going to recognize is
 
03:29:22.150 --> 03:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
Clifton Belo The Honorable Clifton Belo
 
03:29:25.469 --> 03:29:25.479 align:start position:0%
and he will have some comments about
 
03:29:25.479 --> 03:29:27.030 align:start position:0%
and he will have some comments about
the

03:29:27.030 --> 03:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:29:32.950 --> 03:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:36.990 --> 03:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
have six people who have signed up to
 
03:29:41.990 --> 03:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
testify on the bill and uh hopefully
 
03:29:44.790 --> 03:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
they will testify on the amendment not
 
03:29:48.150 --> 03:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
the bill as original Ally written so
 
03:29:50.750 --> 03:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
with that I'll recognize anyone on the
 
03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
committee who wants to ask a question
 
03:30:01.070 --> 03:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:04.590 --> 03:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
amendment well seeing none I guess we'll
 
03:30:06.429 --> 03:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
go right
 
03:30:11.710 --> 03:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:15.990 --> 03:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
Belo and Mr V you are recognized to
 
03:30:22.070 --> 03:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:24.630 --> 03:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr chairman I I was
 
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
having a hard time getting my U unmuting
 
03:30:32.510 --> 03:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
to stick um I I appreciate last week I
 
03:30:35.110 --> 03:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
reached out to Chairman Vos um as well
 
03:30:38.910 --> 03:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
as more recently uh to eversource um and
 
03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
you know offered that I I would like to
 
03:30:42.870 --> 03:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
help try to contribute to some
 
03:30:46.030 --> 03:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
compromise here um I appreciate the fact
 
03:30:48.870 --> 03:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
that he has um Incorporated uh some of
 
03:30:51.309 --> 03:30:51.319 align:start position:0%
the suggested amendments uh that I uh
 
03:30:55.389 --> 03:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
put forth in in my testimony um just to
 
03:30:57.349 --> 03:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
clarify though I I haven't contributed
 
03:30:59.710 --> 03:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
any of the language on um the revised
 
03:31:03.389 --> 03:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
section six of the bill at this point um
 
03:31:06.189 --> 03:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
and um and I and I still have some
 
03:31:09.269 --> 03:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
questions about that but uh I I
 
03:31:11.150 --> 03:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you know apparently
 
03:31:13.750 --> 03:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
eversource's willingness to um
 
03:31:15.349 --> 03:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
accommodate a couple of the suggested
 
03:31:18.670 --> 03:31:18.680 align:start position:0%
amendments um is is a significant
 
03:31:21.990 --> 03:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
movement on their part um I still have a
 
03:31:25.150 --> 03:31:25.160 align:start position:0%
number of issues with the bill um as I
 
03:31:26.990 --> 03:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
do think other parties that I've been in
 
03:31:29.670 --> 03:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
conversation with about it um a lot of
 
03:31:31.110 --> 03:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
those are in the other sections of the
 
03:31:32.510 --> 03:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
bill that this amendment does not
 
03:31:34.229 --> 03:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
address sections one through five and
 
03:31:38.389 --> 03:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
seven of the bill um and so I do hope um
 
03:31:39.750 --> 03:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
that that we'll be able to continue to
 
03:31:42.030 --> 03:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
work to find a common ground because
 
03:31:43.030 --> 03:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
because I think there's been a fair
 
03:31:45.590 --> 03:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
amount of Mis misunderstanding about uh
 
03:31:48.150 --> 03:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
some what's going on both in both in the
 
03:31:51.630 --> 03:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
law and at the Pu
 
03:31:54.870 --> 03:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh the you know if part of the goal is
 
03:31:57.870 --> 03:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
to Simply enable uh and to limit uh
 
03:32:00.630 --> 03:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregation uh to the
 
03:32:02.630 --> 03:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts model it's important to
 
03:32:04.269 --> 03:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
note that the bill you know if it was
 
03:32:05.710 --> 03:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
passed with this amendment would not
 
03:32:08.150 --> 03:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
even do that uh there's still a couple
 
03:32:10.110 --> 03:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
of significant problems even to do the
 
03:32:12.950 --> 03:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
basic Massachusetts model uh and and
 
03:32:15.030 --> 03:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
there's also significant Authority that
 
03:32:17.790 --> 03:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Municipal aggregators have
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
that would uh be curtailed in in this uh
 
03:32:25.269 --> 03:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
um Bill overall um one of those is that
 
03:32:29.309 --> 03:32:29.319 align:start position:0%
um uh everyone has recognized that to do
 
03:32:31.189 --> 03:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
a customer enrollment on an opt out
 
03:32:35.309 --> 03:32:35.319 align:start position:0%
basis the aggregator has to have um uh
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
the account numbers uh of the um default
 
03:32:43.910 --> 03:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
service customers um this bill U does
 
03:32:46.030 --> 03:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
not provide for that and it strikes from
 
03:32:47.590 --> 03:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
the statute in a different section of
 
03:32:49.030 --> 03:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
the bill that's not seen in the
 
03:32:51.590 --> 03:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
amendment um the language that gave the
 
03:32:54.550 --> 03:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
Pu authority to do that as acknowledged
 
03:32:58.030 --> 03:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
by eversource's own attorney uh so you
 
03:33:00.630 --> 03:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
know with with a part of the bill that's
 
03:33:02.910 --> 03:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
not referenced here uh combined with
 
03:33:06.269 --> 03:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
what's in the in the new text um there's
 
03:33:07.710 --> 03:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
there's a pretty strong argument which
 
03:33:10.389 --> 03:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
eversource attorney made that the
 
03:33:12.070 --> 03:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
commission neither the commission nor
 
03:33:14.550 --> 03:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
the aggregators have any Authority uh to
 
03:33:16.710 --> 03:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
obtain the account numbers to do
 
03:33:19.469 --> 03:33:19.479 align:start position:0%
enrollment on an opt-out basis so so
 
03:33:22.710 --> 03:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
that is different than Massachusetts um
 
03:33:26.429 --> 03:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
there's also um I think the the the
 
03:33:28.830 --> 03:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
chairman tried to um address the issue
 
03:33:31.550 --> 03:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
of incremental cost I I agree that that
 
03:33:34.349 --> 03:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
language could or incidental costs I
 
03:33:36.349 --> 03:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
agree that language could uh use some
 
03:33:38.229 --> 03:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
additional clarification I've suggested
 
03:33:41.349 --> 03:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
some but it's not reflected here um
 
03:33:42.830 --> 03:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
there you know what it does is strike
 
03:33:45.550 --> 03:33:45.560 align:start position:0%
the reference to in zental cost uh you
 
03:33:47.269 --> 03:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
know to comply with the provisions of
 
03:33:49.910 --> 03:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
the statute being allowable the notion
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
of incidental cost has been in the law
 
03:33:55.070 --> 03:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
for 25 years no other state has such a
 
03:33:57.469 --> 03:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
restriction um although I agree that we
 
03:33:59.309 --> 03:33:59.319 align:start position:0%
do not want a regular taxpayer
 
03:34:01.229 --> 03:34:01.239 align:start position:0%
subsidizing this kind of program once
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
it's up and running um however the
 
03:34:05.469 --> 03:34:05.479 align:start position:0%
language about increment incremental
 
03:34:08.030 --> 03:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
cost associated with the establishment
 
03:34:09.790 --> 03:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
of such a program could include
 
03:34:11.710 --> 03:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
something as simple as having a
 
03:34:15.389 --> 03:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
community's um Town Council review the
 
03:34:17.550 --> 03:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
propos warrant article for the town
 
03:34:19.150 --> 03:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
meeting to consider adoption of an
 
03:34:22.110 --> 03:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
aggregation plan um or to review the
 
03:34:24.990 --> 03:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
aggregation plan itself or even at a
 
03:34:26.590 --> 03:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
city council meeting where we discuss
 
03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
the matter we pay our recording
 
03:34:30.910 --> 03:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
secretary by the hour so if we spend an
 
03:34:33.269 --> 03:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
hour discussing an aggregation plan is
 
03:34:35.389 --> 03:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
that an incremental cost associated with
 
03:34:37.349 --> 03:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
establishing the program it's I just
 
03:34:39.710 --> 03:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
think it it you know we had that problem
 
03:34:41.710 --> 03:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
when we with my city manager we began to
 
03:34:43.110 --> 03:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
look at this and there was just a
 
03:34:45.070 --> 03:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
discomfort in spending anything
 
03:34:48.150 --> 03:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
including half time on this with with
 
03:34:50.790 --> 03:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
with such a broad uh prohibition so I
 
03:34:53.349 --> 03:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
think that still needs clarification um
 
03:34:56.349 --> 03:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
more significantly though the bill does
 
03:34:58.950 --> 03:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
um uh really shut off a lot of
 
03:35:01.830 --> 03:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities for uh aggregate uh for
 
03:35:05.550 --> 03:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
for um Innovative new markets uh that
 
03:35:07.229 --> 03:35:07.239 align:start position:0%
could harness the power of competitive
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
markets and just real quickly sort of
 
03:35:12.910 --> 03:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
Economics 101 is the notion that supply
 
03:35:15.229 --> 03:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
and demand need to see similar price
 
03:35:17.349 --> 03:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
signals in order to optimize price
 
03:35:19.990 --> 03:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
formation we have a wholesale Market in
 
03:35:22.469 --> 03:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
which there is a very strong temporal
 
03:35:25.110 --> 03:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
aspect to the value of electricity we
 
03:35:26.750 --> 03:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
have a retail Market that does not
 
03:35:29.189 --> 03:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
translate those in order to do that you
 
03:35:33.309 --> 03:35:33.319 align:start position:0%
need interval metering and um and and
 
03:35:36.110 --> 03:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
the the current law simply allows with
 
03:35:38.630 --> 03:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
the Pu approving it in an adjudicated
 
03:35:40.990 --> 03:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
proceeding uh for there to be a method
 
03:35:42.710 --> 03:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
for an aggregation to potentially
 
03:35:45.910 --> 03:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
contribute uh to the cost uh to upgrade
 
03:35:48.990 --> 03:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
such interval metering and it's it's
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's I just want to say if you haven't
 
03:35:53.590 --> 03:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
had a chance to look at Professor em
 
03:35:55.510 --> 03:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
Freed's testimony I would urge you to do
 
03:35:58.830 --> 03:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
so sort of buried in his long document
 
03:36:00.910 --> 03:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
is the fact that the city of Lebanon

03:36:39.110 --> 03:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
response of electric loads and
 
03:36:40.710 --> 03:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
generation on the customer side of the
 
03:36:43.389 --> 03:36:43.399 align:start position:0%
meter to price signals it's it's just a
 
03:36:45.030 --> 03:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
basic thing that can improve the
 
03:36:47.269 --> 03:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
economic efficiency of what we're doing
 
03:36:49.349 --> 03:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of over the time uh so I'm
 
03:36:51.110 --> 03:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
going to stop there but I I hope to
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
continue working with the sponsor and
 
03:36:54.790 --> 03:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
other interested stakeholders to figure
 
03:36:56.750 --> 03:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
out language that can actually make this
 
03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
work um for all of us thank
 
03:37:05.229 --> 03:37:05.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh Mr V can you tell us
 
03:37:07.870 --> 03:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
specifically where in either the
 
03:37:12.389 --> 03:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:15.510 --> 03:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
bill that new lead new languages need
 
03:37:17.469 --> 03:37:17.479 align:start position:0%
needed in order to
 
03:37:20.070 --> 03:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
enable the kinds of things you were just
 
03:37:23.269 --> 03:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
talking about um with regard to the
 
03:37:28.150 --> 03:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
development of uh a new paradigm for
 
03:37:32.830 --> 03:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
connecting consumers and uh providers of
 
03:37:36.790 --> 03:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
electricity well just for starters um
 
03:37:39.510 --> 03:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
the um bill in a section that's
 
03:37:42.870 --> 03:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
unamended would strike the authority uh
 
03:37:46.030 --> 03:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
for an aggregation to provide demand
 
03:37:48.429 --> 03:37:48.439 align:start position:0%
side man management out outside of the
 
03:37:51.349 --> 03:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
utility or is on New England programs
 
03:37:54.070 --> 03:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
and that's a specific example that we
 
03:37:56.630 --> 03:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
want to continue and develop in our
 
03:38:00.950 --> 03:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
pilot which is uh we worked with a um an
 
03:38:04.510 --> 03:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
a broker Freedom energy Logistics uh to
 
03:38:07.189 --> 03:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
curtail our load at the uh times that
 
03:38:09.870 --> 03:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
were projected to be a coincident Peak
 
03:38:12.990 --> 03:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
demand so that we could uh reduce
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
dramatically reduce our capacity tag uh
 
03:38:17.590 --> 03:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
for the forward capacity Market that's
 
03:38:19.670 --> 03:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
not a utility or is a New England
 
03:38:23.830 --> 03:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
program it's the kind of um thing that
 
03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
transactive energy value would provide
 
03:38:28.349 --> 03:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
um help customers to take something as
 
03:38:30.070 --> 03:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
simple as their hot water heater and
 
03:38:33.950 --> 03:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
move it off um off peak um just just
 
03:38:35.510 --> 03:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
another example of something that might
 
03:38:38.670 --> 03:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
be problematic is um we we worked the
 
03:38:41.110 --> 03:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
city worked with I uh Liberty to develop
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
their um battery pilot the battery pilot
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
has um both them supplying batteries and
 
03:38:50.790 --> 03:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
also um a bring your own battery option
 
03:38:53.229 --> 03:38:53.239 align:start position:0%
that hasn't really quite begun yet well
 
03:38:56.590 --> 03:38:56.600 align:start position:0%
we would like to maybe um work with that
 
03:38:58.830 --> 03:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
situation but the but the new language
 
03:39:02.550 --> 03:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
in the bill um talks about um even an
 
03:39:06.150 --> 03:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
opt-in program um being not allowed to
 
03:39:09.150 --> 03:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
have any exit uh fees well Liberty in
 
03:39:10.830 --> 03:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
their battery program because they're
 
03:39:12.790 --> 03:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
financing the cost of the battery has an
 
03:39:14.349 --> 03:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
exit fee if somebody terminates the
 
03:39:17.030 --> 03:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
contract early uh they have to pay for
 
03:39:19.269 --> 03:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
having the battery removed and perhaps
 
03:39:21.750 --> 03:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
some other cost but this bill would say
 
03:39:23.229 --> 03:39:23.239 align:start position:0%
we could not do the same thing with a
 
03:39:25.710 --> 03:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
bring your own battery program uh just
 
03:39:29.750 --> 03:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
as one example um there there are more
 
03:39:32.550 --> 03:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
that I could go into um I can do that
 
03:39:35.510 --> 03:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
now if you'd like um but but those are
 
03:39:39.389 --> 03:39:39.399 align:start position:0%
illustrative of of the problems I think
 
03:39:43.030 --> 03:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
um well I appreciate that and maybe
 
03:39:45.990 --> 03:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
those examples are illustrative
 
03:39:50.269 --> 03:39:50.279 align:start position:0%
what was not illustrative was a specific
 
03:39:52.790 --> 03:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
reference to a line in the
 
03:39:56.550 --> 03:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
bill or the amendment that you find
 
03:39:59.389 --> 03:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
objectional okay well the specific um
 
03:40:02.670 --> 03:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
more guidance on on what what language
 
03:40:06.110 --> 03:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
you specifically have problems with yes
 
03:40:10.710 --> 03:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
on page one um line 13 of the bill um it
 
03:40:14.070 --> 03:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
changes the law that just simply says we
 
03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
could provide demand site Management
 
03:40:19.070 --> 03:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
Services to say through utility or
 
03:40:21.110 --> 03:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
Regional system operator administered
 
03:40:24.189 --> 03:40:24.199 align:start position:0%
management programs and you know just a
 
03:40:26.269 --> 03:40:26.279 align:start position:0%
rule of statutory construction if
 
03:40:27.910 --> 03:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
something said you could do demand side
 
03:40:29.950 --> 03:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
management before but now it's changed
 
03:40:32.910 --> 03:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
and says through these two things by
 
03:40:35.150 --> 03:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
implication uh you can't do it outside
 
03:40:38.590 --> 03:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
of those two activities so you know I
 
03:40:40.670 --> 03:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
think we would lose our authority to do
 
03:40:42.710 --> 03:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
that outside of those programs same
 
03:40:45.389 --> 03:40:45.399 align:start position:0%
thing with conservation um the same
 
03:40:48.590 --> 03:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
thing with with meter reading the meter
 
03:40:50.550 --> 03:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
reading even in the proposed rules can
 
03:40:52.910 --> 03:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
only be effectuated in cooperation with
 
03:40:55.710 --> 03:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
utility and by approval of the Pu but
 
03:40:58.750 --> 03:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
that would be part of our uh pilot that
 
03:41:00.870 --> 03:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
we want to work out with liberty and
 
03:41:02.229 --> 03:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
Liberty is indicated that they're
 
03:41:04.110 --> 03:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
willing to work out with us to figure
 
03:41:07.309 --> 03:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
out how we can do that um so so that's
 
03:41:08.830 --> 03:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
you know there there's three of them
 
03:41:10.429 --> 03:41:10.439 align:start position:0%
right there in section three of the bill
 
03:41:16.870 --> 03:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:19.269 --> 03:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
to be specific okay thank you I
 
03:41:23.349 --> 03:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate that specificity it helps uh
 
03:41:25.550 --> 03:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
understand helps us understand how we
 
03:41:28.429 --> 03:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
could make changes to the bill that
 
03:41:29.750 --> 03:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
could be
 
03:41:32.429 --> 03:41:32.439 align:start position:0%
acceptable provided of course that other
 
03:41:35.670 --> 03:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
parties are are agreeable to
 
03:41:39.830 --> 03:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
it are there any other specific examples
 
03:41:41.389 --> 03:41:41.399 align:start position:0%
well yes in section one of the bill at
 
03:41:44.670 --> 03:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
line three striking the word provide um
 
03:41:46.349 --> 03:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
it now says we could only broker or
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
contract for those services our thought
 
03:41:52.950 --> 03:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
for our limited pilot you know for 25
 
03:41:55.710 --> 03:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
maybe 25 or 50 customers including a
 
03:41:59.790 --> 03:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
number of City accounts um was that it
 
03:42:02.149 --> 03:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
might be easiest to do that if we
 
03:42:03.910 --> 03:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves with the load serving entity
 
03:42:05.750 --> 03:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
because for the sort of mass Market
 
03:42:08.550 --> 03:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
product the um the opt out product that
 
03:42:10.229 --> 03:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
would be based on a fixed price there's
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
no no variable pricing there that the
 
03:42:14.110 --> 03:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
customers would know in advance so this
 
03:42:15.990 --> 03:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
would be an opin opt
 
03:42:19.550 --> 03:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
um and the thought was you know a load
 
03:42:21.870 --> 03:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
serving entity creates its own meter
 
03:42:24.269 --> 03:42:24.279 align:start position:0%
domain each one so for instance the town
 
03:42:26.030 --> 03:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
of Handover is its own load serving
 
03:42:28.070 --> 03:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
entity and all the municipal meters are
 
03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
under their load serving domain um and
 
03:42:35.910 --> 03:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh that way we could take the um uh
 
03:42:37.750 --> 03:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
real-time pricing product or dead
 
03:42:39.870 --> 03:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
pricing product from ISO no England that
 
03:42:43.269 --> 03:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
were're build and uh use use that uh as
 
03:42:45.630 --> 03:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
a vehicle to do that with uh
 
03:42:48.670 --> 03:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
other customers that are in the pilot um
 
03:42:50.830 --> 03:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
so striking the language about provide
 
03:42:52.550 --> 03:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
there is problematic it's also
 
03:42:55.309 --> 03:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
problematic uh elsewhere in the bill
 
03:42:58.229 --> 03:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
where um it it removes language about um
 
03:43:01.149 --> 03:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
allowing a uh aggregation to be a load
 
03:43:03.389 --> 03:43:03.399 align:start position:0%
serving entity now now I I just want to
 
03:43:04.910 --> 03:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
say that I think the vast majority of
 
03:43:06.429 --> 03:43:06.439 align:start position:0%
communities this is not where anybody's
 
03:43:10.630 --> 03:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
going to start um uh you know th this is
 
03:43:12.870 --> 03:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps very limited in its initial
 
03:43:15.349 --> 03:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
steps um and it's more of a pilot and
 
03:43:17.110 --> 03:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
we'd have to prove you know prove the
 
03:43:18.670 --> 03:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
concept that this is actually something
 
03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
that can work uh but but um we we think
 
03:43:26.110 --> 03:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
it's worth doing and don't see why you
 
03:43:28.510 --> 03:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
know we we reference in this uh Grant
 
03:43:31.309 --> 03:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
application the fact that um this the
 
03:43:33.269 --> 03:43:33.279 align:start position:0%
existing law gives us the authorities to
 
03:43:36.750 --> 03:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
be able to do this and that kind of you
 
03:43:41.070 --> 03:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
know would likely go away um uh with
 
03:43:43.110 --> 03:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
without further accommodation in terms
 
03:43:46.990 --> 03:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:50.550 --> 03:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
okay so I appreciate that um specific
 
03:43:53.429 --> 03:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
information it sounds to me like it
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
might be useful for us to get together a
 
03:43:59.910 --> 03:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
group of interested parties get together
 
03:44:04.510 --> 03:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
in a room and sit down and go line by
 
03:44:06.590 --> 03:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
line through the existing law and
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
propose changes to it to see what we can
 
03:44:13.990 --> 03:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
agree on uh jointly usually in those
 
03:44:16.349 --> 03:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
kinds of sessions nobody gets everything
 
03:44:18.590 --> 03:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
they want there's parts of the bill that
 
03:44:21.950 --> 03:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
everybody hates but um it's something
 
03:44:23.870 --> 03:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
that everybody can lo is that something
 
03:44:25.830 --> 03:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
that you'd be willing to participate in
 
03:44:29.070 --> 03:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
I would certainly uh make a full full
 
03:44:31.630 --> 03:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
effort to do such um and make the time
 
03:44:34.550 --> 03:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
to do that over the next two
 
03:44:37.389 --> 03:44:37.399 align:start position:0%
weeks okay thank you I'll now the chair
 
03:44:39.429 --> 03:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
will now recognize representative McGee
 
03:44:42.309 --> 03:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:44:44.830 --> 03:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Belo for taking my question
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that has struck me
 
03:44:49.870 --> 03:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
over the life of our looking at um HB
 
03:44:53.510 --> 03:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
315 is we've received a lot of different
 
03:44:55.590 --> 03:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
um we've received amendments but we've
 
03:44:59.229 --> 03:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
also received documents trying to uh
 
03:45:02.469 --> 03:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
Chronicle the difference that's going on
 
03:45:05.870 --> 03:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
in what 53e was and what it is now and
 
03:45:08.510 --> 03:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to figure out the
 
03:45:10.349 --> 03:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
changes and I think you mentioned this
 
03:45:11.950 --> 03:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
in your testimony so that's what I'm
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
leading to is it appears that in the
 
03:45:17.710 --> 03:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
amendment there are a number of areas of
 
03:45:20.550 --> 03:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
53e that are omitted so that you can't
 
03:45:22.149 --> 03:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
actually read through it and figure out
 
03:45:24.710 --> 03:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
which things are being lost and which
 
03:45:27.630 --> 03:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
things are being edited and which things
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
would remain as they are so I think from
 
03:45:31.870 --> 03:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
my perspective it's very hard for me to
 
03:45:34.590 --> 03:45:34.600 align:start position:0%
follow the changes one of those examples
 
03:45:37.110 --> 03:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
I I noted was in I think it's section
 
03:45:40.189 --> 03:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
three under regulation of aggregators
 
03:45:41.710 --> 03:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
03:45:44.269 --> 03:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
53e um there's a question of whether an
 
03:45:46.229 --> 03:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
aggregator will be considered a public
 
03:45:49.510 --> 03:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
utility or not and so there's there's
 
03:45:53.229 --> 03:45:53.239 align:start position:0%
some very sort of important changes and
 
03:45:55.670 --> 03:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
to Chairman Bose's point we really need
 
03:45:58.030 --> 03:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to go through the through the
 
03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
sections of what we're proposing to
 
03:46:02.309 --> 03:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
change so that we know what we're voting
 
03:46:04.670 --> 03:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
for um because it seems like some of
 
03:46:06.510 --> 03:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
these could be extremely significant to
 
03:46:08.070 --> 03:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
how things operate in the real world and
 
03:46:09.469 --> 03:46:09.479 align:start position:0%
I just wondered if you could comment on
 
03:46:11.870 --> 03:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
that because you seem to be you know
 
03:46:14.910 --> 03:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
intimately familiar with the original uh
 
03:46:17.309 --> 03:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
RSA and and the changes you've been
 
03:46:19.710 --> 03:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
following the changes as they've been
 
03:46:22.550 --> 03:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
going well yes and that's why I provided
 
03:46:27.910 --> 03:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
as a tachman a in my um testimony uh
 
03:46:31.149 --> 03:46:31.159 align:start position:0%
that kind of U detail you know I I went
 
03:46:34.349 --> 03:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
through and um because many sections of
 
03:46:37.389 --> 03:46:37.399 align:start position:0%
the the bill are repeal and replace it's
 
03:46:39.870 --> 03:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
not obvious how they changed the law and
 
03:46:41.429 --> 03:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
when I first read through the bill
 
03:46:42.990 --> 03:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
several parts I thought well that's not
 
03:46:44.670 --> 03:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
too bad but then when I actually looked
 
03:46:46.389 --> 03:46:46.399 align:start position:0%
at how it changed the statute I said
 
03:46:49.950 --> 03:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
that's very problematic so um you know
 
03:46:51.870 --> 03:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
as it progresses I'd be happy to do the
 
03:46:54.229 --> 03:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
same you know one of the attachments to
 
03:46:56.269 --> 03:46:56.279 align:start position:0%
my testimony actually went back to two
 
03:46:58.269 --> 03:46:58.279 align:start position:0%
years ago where I did the same thing and
 
03:47:00.710 --> 03:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
showed how the bill and I provided that
 
03:47:03.030 --> 03:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
back um in the Senate as well as in the
 
03:47:05.269 --> 03:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
house and provided it to all the
 
03:47:07.429 --> 03:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
utilities and the Pu and other
 
03:47:09.670 --> 03:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholders uh so so people could you
 
03:47:13.309 --> 03:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
know see it all in detail and I I I I
 
03:47:17.149 --> 03:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:19.229 --> 03:47:19.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative oxenham is
 
03:47:20.590 --> 03:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
03:47:23.469 --> 03:47:23.479 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much Mr chair um
 
03:47:25.149 --> 03:47:25.159 align:start position:0%
I I think we can all agree that this
 
03:47:28.750 --> 03:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
bill is not ready for prime time I we
 
03:47:31.469 --> 03:47:31.479 align:start position:0%
have um objections from the municipal
 
03:47:33.750 --> 03:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
Association from Mayors from energy
 
03:47:36.990 --> 03:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
committees from businesses saying that
 
03:47:39.710 --> 03:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
this is going to interfere with um
 
03:47:42.910 --> 03:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
projected investment plans uh interfere
 
03:47:46.510 --> 03:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
with efforts to achieve ready for 100
 
03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
commitments that towns have made to
 
03:47:52.070 --> 03:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
their constituents um I I don't see the
 
03:47:54.110 --> 03:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
point in you know we've been told again
 
03:47:55.710 --> 03:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
and again we have to hurry up we can't
 
03:47:58.309 --> 03:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
ask questions we have to move along and
 
03:48:01.149 --> 03:48:01.159 align:start position:0%
and you this this seems to me to be an
 
03:48:03.189 --> 03:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
inappropriate use of the time of this
 
03:48:04.990 --> 03:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
body if we're running up against
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
deadlines the bill is is not ready to
 
03:48:10.990 --> 03:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
proceed and and we should move on is
 
03:48:12.389 --> 03:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
there a question
 
03:48:14.510 --> 03:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
there no so that was addressed to the
 
03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
chair I think that this is a misuse of
 
03:48:18.510 --> 03:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
time I was reprimanded at the end of the
 
03:48:21.269 --> 03:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
last session for wasting people's time I
 
03:48:23.389 --> 03:48:23.399 align:start position:0%
I I don't understand how this particular
 
03:48:25.830 --> 03:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
Bill maybe it's because who the sponsor
 
03:48:28.710 --> 03:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
is the the time limits no longer seem to
 
03:48:32.070 --> 03:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
matter well I apologize representative
 
03:48:34.990 --> 03:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
if we're wasting your time but we're
 
03:48:37.110 --> 03:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
obligated to follow the rules of the
 
03:48:39.550 --> 03:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
house we started a public hearing and we
 
03:48:42.429 --> 03:48:42.439 align:start position:0%
have to finish the public hearing and we
 
03:48:45.630 --> 03:48:45.640 align:start position:0%
have one two three four five may I ask
 
03:48:47.309 --> 03:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
that we move along rather than go
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
through this line by
 
03:48:51.229 --> 03:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
line this is not an appropriate use of
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
the committee's time this should be done
 
03:48:56.349 --> 03:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:59.070 --> 03:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
session representative oxam you keep
 
03:49:01.910 --> 03:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
interrupting and you really
 
03:49:05.429 --> 03:49:05.439 align:start position:0%
are gonna have to seriously consider
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
changing your behavior you're disrupting
 
03:49:10.630 --> 03:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
the process to the point where it's
 
03:49:12.389 --> 03:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
getting very very difficult to get
 
03:49:12.399 --> 03:49:13.550 align:start position:0%
getting very very difficult to get
anything

03:49:13.550 --> 03:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:49:15.990 --> 03:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
done um
 
03:49:18.550 --> 03:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
I object to your comment because I could
 
03:49:20.590 --> 03:49:20.600 align:start position:0%
object to a lot of behaviors I've seen
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
here so I think you're
 
03:49:25.950 --> 03:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
being uh I don't want to be interrupted
 
03:49:28.950 --> 03:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
until I finish my point I will recognize
 
03:49:32.870 --> 03:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
you representative ssuch to speak once I
 
03:49:35.309 --> 03:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
have concluded what I have to say and
 
03:49:37.110 --> 03:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to allow you to interrupt
 
03:49:39.670 --> 03:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
me while I'm
 
03:49:41.950 --> 03:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
speaking the point I was trying to make
 
03:49:44.750 --> 03:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative oxim is we have rules of
 
03:49:47.429 --> 03:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
decorum in the committee and you seem to
 
03:49:51.710 --> 03:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
flout them Time After Time After Time I
 
03:49:54.389 --> 03:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
have discussed this with you an email
 
03:49:57.110 --> 03:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
you even apologized to me and
 
03:50:00.189 --> 03:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that you were in violation
 
03:50:03.189 --> 03:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
of our code of decorum and yet you keep
 
03:50:05.870 --> 03:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
doing it over and over and over I'm
 
03:50:07.910 --> 03:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
reluctant to speak to the speaker of the
 
03:50:10.469 --> 03:50:10.479 align:start position:0%
house about you and your behavior but if
 
03:50:12.870 --> 03:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
you continue I I don't see how I have
 
03:50:15.429 --> 03:50:15.439 align:start position:0%
any other choice but to do that so
 
03:50:18.269 --> 03:50:18.279 align:start position:0%
please think about what you're doing and
 
03:50:22.710 --> 03:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:25.469 --> 03:50:25.479 align:start position:0%
dor representative samset you're now
 
03:50:28.710 --> 03:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
03:50:31.429 --> 03:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman but as a
 
03:50:33.149 --> 03:50:33.159 align:start position:0%
point of order I'd first like to make
 
03:50:35.590 --> 03:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
the comment I think that you are being
 
03:50:38.269 --> 03:50:38.279 align:start position:0%
very biased and one-sided here about
 
03:50:40.550 --> 03:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
such things and it may be a little bit
 
03:50:43.030 --> 03:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
too delicate but let me ask a question
 
03:50:47.469 --> 03:50:47.479 align:start position:0%
of Mr Belo um we all kind of have seen
 
03:50:49.670 --> 03:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
from the testimony that this is a very
 
03:50:52.590 --> 03:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
complicated Bill and even the changes
 
03:50:55.030 --> 03:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
that have been proposed are very
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
detailed and very complicated so my
 
03:50:59.910 --> 03:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
question to Mr Belo is in light of the
 
03:51:02.429 --> 03:51:02.439 align:start position:0%
fact that this bill was only signed in
 
03:51:05.030 --> 03:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
2019 by the governor and the rules have
 
03:51:08.950 --> 03:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
not yet been finalized by the Pu why do
 
03:51:11.429 --> 03:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
we even need to change it before we can
 
03:51:14.670 --> 03:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
see how it's implemented
 
03:51:16.590 --> 03:51:16.600 align:start position:0%
well I I I think there are a couple of
 
03:51:18.349 --> 03:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
things and the the amendment does
 
03:51:22.030 --> 03:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
address those uh that there is a broader
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
consensus that that should be changed
 
03:51:26.950 --> 03:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
just to avoid unnecessary cost for the
 
03:51:30.590 --> 03:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
utilities to change their U software and
 
03:51:32.830 --> 03:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
business processes it doesn't really
 
03:51:36.269 --> 03:51:36.279 align:start position:0%
affect uh um the the effectiveness or
 
03:51:38.870 --> 03:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
what Municipal aggregators could do it's
 
03:51:42.429 --> 03:51:42.439 align:start position:0%
just um um an issue that would be easier
 
03:51:45.229 --> 03:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
fixed in the statute than in rules and
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
and I say that because I you know tried
 
03:51:51.229 --> 03:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
to draft Draft rules that work around
 
03:51:54.030 --> 03:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
the constraint of the statute and and
 
03:51:57.110 --> 03:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
nobody was really happy with that um uh
 
03:51:59.110 --> 03:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
so I think you know there is a piece of
 
03:52:00.790 --> 03:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
this that's easier change through
 
03:52:03.670 --> 03:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
statute um there there is a Senate bill
 
03:52:05.790 --> 03:52:05.800 align:start position:0%
that uh uh addresses that very issue
 
03:52:07.389 --> 03:52:07.399 align:start position:0%
that that is part of one of the
 
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
Amendments that was incorporated in uh
 
03:52:12.910 --> 03:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
to Chairman vos's um proposed amendment
 
03:52:15.030 --> 03:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
03:52:16.750 --> 03:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
and and I know that something that that
 
03:52:19.790 --> 03:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
is um you know the main issue that
 
03:52:21.910 --> 03:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
Liberty originally was approached on
 
03:52:23.830 --> 03:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
about the bill and and they agreed it
 
03:52:25.510 --> 03:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
should be changed I agree that could be
 
03:52:28.429 --> 03:52:28.439 align:start position:0%
changed so so I mean my preference is to
 
03:52:30.149 --> 03:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
sort of narrow the scope to the things
 
03:52:31.630 --> 03:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
that really need to be addressed but I
 
03:52:34.229 --> 03:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
but I I hear ever Source saying that
 
03:52:35.830 --> 03:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
they feel like there's more than just
 
03:52:37.189 --> 03:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
that issue that needs to be addressed
 
03:52:39.550 --> 03:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to engage in that direct
 
03:52:41.990 --> 03:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
dialogue with them and and see if we can
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
get to yes over the next two weeks um
 
03:52:46.429 --> 03:52:46.439 align:start position:0%
you know I think it'd be better if we if
 
03:52:49.070 --> 03:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
we can clean this up this year than but
 
03:52:50.950 --> 03:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
but but if it can't be you know I would
 
03:52:52.910 --> 03:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
hope the consider committee would
 
03:52:54.710 --> 03:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
consider retaining the bill and look at
 
03:52:56.349 --> 03:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
what comes over from the Senate as a
 
03:52:59.469 --> 03:52:59.479 align:start position:0%
possible um interm solution where where
 
03:53:00.790 --> 03:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
there you know there could be time to
 
03:53:03.830 --> 03:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
look at all the other issues um but but
 
03:53:05.950 --> 03:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
you're right it hasn't even nobody's
 
03:53:07.830 --> 03:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
actually started a a municipal
 
03:53:09.349 --> 03:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
aggregation yet there's a lot of
 
03:53:11.149 --> 03:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
interest in it I think a lot of the
 
03:53:13.349 --> 03:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
interest is on the potential of how this
 
03:53:15.309 --> 03:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
could develop over time and and we
 
03:53:17.309 --> 03:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
really see this as an ability to have
 
03:53:19.590 --> 03:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
our local communities partner with the
 
03:53:22.550 --> 03:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities um because we all
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
know that there's fairly dramatic
 
03:53:26.110 --> 03:53:26.120 align:start position:0%
improvements that could be done to the
 
03:53:28.229 --> 03:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
electric grid in terms of the E
 
03:53:30.149 --> 03:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
efficiency of how it operates that's
 
03:53:31.790 --> 03:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
what a lot of the grid modernization
 
03:53:33.269 --> 03:53:33.279 align:start position:0%
discussion has been about the
 
03:53:35.070 --> 03:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
development of time of use rates what we
 
03:53:37.870 --> 03:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
need to do to accommodate EV charging uh
 
03:53:39.550 --> 03:53:39.560 align:start position:0%
without you know pushing that all on
 
03:53:41.750 --> 03:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
Peak demand uh so so there's a whole
 
03:53:43.510 --> 03:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
bunch of interconnected issues and I
 
03:53:45.070 --> 03:53:45.080 align:start position:0%
think that over time
 
03:53:46.790 --> 03:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
communities could be better partners
 
03:53:48.790 --> 03:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
with utilities and it would help you
 
03:53:51.630 --> 03:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
know part of the vision of this is that
 
03:53:53.510 --> 03:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
if you're a municipal aggregation and
 
03:53:56.710 --> 03:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
you're providing load following service
 
03:53:58.389 --> 03:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
local people are going to need to learn
 
03:54:00.429 --> 03:54:00.439 align:start position:0%
more about what that really means you
 
03:54:03.229 --> 03:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
can't just rely on solar um like we do
 
03:54:05.189 --> 03:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
in net metering you know it produces in
 
03:54:06.910 --> 03:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
the summer you use it in the winter well
 
03:54:08.389 --> 03:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
you that only works if you actually have
 
03:54:10.630 --> 03:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
storage that can last that long uh in
 
03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
terms of load following service so I'm
 
03:54:15.269 --> 03:54:15.279 align:start position:0%
kind of getting off point here but but
 
03:54:20.070 --> 03:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
um you know yes um it's it's complex uh
 
03:54:22.149 --> 03:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
but the system is complex and I think
 
03:54:24.510 --> 03:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
the more there is community engagement
 
03:54:26.349 --> 03:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
in understanding how it works and
 
03:54:28.110 --> 03:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
working with the distribution Utilities
 
03:54:30.030 --> 03:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
in constructive ways the better off
 
03:54:32.590 --> 03:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to be thank
 
03:54:36.149 --> 03:54:36.159 align:start position:0%

03:54:38.349 --> 03:54:38.359 align:start position:0%

of the council or our our our committee
 
03:55:42.630 --> 03:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
because we have not yet had the chance
 
03:55:45.269 --> 03:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
to fully review the legislation however
 
03:55:47.710 --> 03:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
you do also have a letter signed by our
 
03:55:51.670 --> 03:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
mayor in opposition to the bill um the
 
03:55:53.189 --> 03:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
sustainability committee on which I
 
03:55:55.349 --> 03:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
serve has been working since last year
 
03:55:57.429 --> 03:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
to review opportunities for Portsmith
 
03:55:59.590 --> 03:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
related to community power at our
 
03:56:01.309 --> 03:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
meeting last month we were getting ready
 
03:56:04.229 --> 03:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
for a work session uh to present uh for
 
03:56:06.990 --> 03:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
the city council to formalize pursuit of
 
03:56:08.990 --> 03:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
a community power program and think
 
03:56:11.630 --> 03:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
about other Coalition opportunities in
 
03:56:15.070 --> 03:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
this regard we're concerned that hb3 315
 
03:56:16.750 --> 03:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
will hamper the pursuit of community
 
03:56:18.070 --> 03:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
power for the benefit of our
 
03:56:20.590 --> 03:56:20.600 align:start position:0%
municipality and taxpayers it greatly
 
03:56:23.189 --> 03:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
limits or eliminates local control and
 
03:56:24.710 --> 03:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
Community customer choice for
 
03:56:27.469 --> 03:56:27.479 align:start position:0%
competitive electricity services it
 
03:56:28.950 --> 03:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
would hurt our ability to Source
 
03:56:31.870 --> 03:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
electricity from local Renewables like
 
03:56:34.030 --> 03:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
solar power uh there was some question
 
03:56:36.229 --> 03:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
earlier in the public hearing last week
 
03:56:38.910 --> 03:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
regarding um uh public discussions I do
 
03:56:39.950 --> 03:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
definitely want to share there a
 
03:56:41.630 --> 03:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
significant interest in Portsmouth for
 
03:56:43.750 --> 03:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
Community aggregation and Community
 
03:56:43.760 --> 03:56:44.910 align:start position:0%
Community aggregation and Community
power

03:56:44.910 --> 03:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
power
 
03:56:47.070 --> 03:56:47.080 align:start position:0%
and finally I did want to express
 
03:56:48.790 --> 03:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
agreement with a comment from uh
 
03:56:50.590 --> 03:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
representative ssuch during the February
 
03:56:53.550 --> 03:56:53.560 align:start position:0%
12th hearing uh regarding confidence in
 
03:56:55.309 --> 03:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to choose alternative
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
suppliers with our municipality
 
03:56:59.750 --> 03:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing Community power opportunities
 
03:57:01.349 --> 03:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
we can increase the likelihood of our
 
03:57:03.670 --> 03:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
residents being comfortable to enjoy the
 
03:57:06.149 --> 03:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
advantages of competition to Source less
 
03:57:08.950 --> 03:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
expensive power Andor power sourced from
 
03:57:11.189 --> 03:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
Renewables beyond that we we hope to
 
03:57:12.830 --> 03:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
work with our local representatives to
 
03:57:14.670 --> 03:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
discuss further thank you for
 
03:57:16.269 --> 03:57:16.279 align:start position:0%
letting me share My
 
03:57:19.189 --> 03:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
Views you very much we appreciate it any
 
03:57:22.590 --> 03:57:22.600 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr L representative Samson
 
03:57:25.349 --> 03:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
should recognize for a
 
03:57:27.870 --> 03:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:57:33.469 --> 03:57:33.479 align:start position:0%
you U Mr glenby for coming to testify um
 
03:57:35.870 --> 03:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
my my impression from your comments was
 
03:57:40.110 --> 03:57:40.120 align:start position:0%
that uh you you and uh your group in
 
03:57:43.110 --> 03:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
Portsmith apparently see the current law
 
03:57:45.670 --> 03:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
as it is right now now as offering you
 
03:57:47.630 --> 03:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
all the opportunities you would like to
 
03:57:51.510 --> 03:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
use um without it having to be changed
 
03:57:55.110 --> 03:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
so um is is that kind of is that
 
03:57:56.790 --> 03:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
impression correct that you think the
 
03:57:59.269 --> 03:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
law as it is right now for you and your
 
03:58:02.429 --> 03:58:02.439 align:start position:0%
your efforts are is already in place the
 
03:58:04.030 --> 03:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
way you'd like that to
 
03:58:06.790 --> 03:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
be yes I I I I think that would be
 
03:58:09.870 --> 03:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
accurate to be clear you know we are
 
03:58:12.990 --> 03:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
we're not as far along as some of the um
 
03:58:15.070 --> 03:58:15.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire communities in pursuing
 
03:58:17.070 --> 03:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
this so we've been looking at this for
 
03:58:19.469 --> 03:58:19.479 align:start position:0%
the last few months um we see the
 
03:58:21.590 --> 03:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities we're seeing examples set
 
03:58:24.229 --> 03:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
by you know other cities like Lebanon
 
03:58:28.269 --> 03:58:28.279 align:start position:0%
and and NASA um and and see a great deal
 
03:58:30.550 --> 03:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
of opportunity beyond that you know as
 
03:58:32.149 --> 03:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
it as it is sort of a complicated
 
03:58:35.030 --> 03:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
subject we are relying on numerous other
 
03:58:37.110 --> 03:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
people who spend more time with it uh
 
03:58:40.229 --> 03:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
the new Municipal Association is one of
 
03:58:41.790 --> 03:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
those groups that you know we definitely
 
03:58:46.149 --> 03:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
rely on their input um and others um
 
03:58:47.950 --> 03:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
even the testimony you've received from
 
03:58:50.830 --> 03:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
others um who are further along so you
 
03:58:53.389 --> 03:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
know whether it was fully baked I can't
 
03:58:55.349 --> 03:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
really comment on in terms of the the
 
03:58:57.189 --> 03:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
existing legislation we certainly saw
 
03:59:00.950 --> 03:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity and we um would uh we
 
03:59:02.910 --> 03:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
would hate to lose that opportunity I
 
03:59:04.710 --> 03:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
think would would really be it and if if
 
03:59:08.429 --> 03:59:08.439 align:start position:0%
this new legislation even as amended um
 
03:59:10.510 --> 03:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
would would hamper that Pursuit uh that
 
03:59:11.870 --> 03:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
03:59:14.990 --> 03:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
concern thank you very much
 
03:59:17.429 --> 03:59:17.439 align:start position:0%
representative Cali pittz is recognized
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:27.550 --> 03:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
question I didn't forget I'm just slow
 
03:59:31.269 --> 03:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
on the trigger Council Len um do you
 
03:59:33.469 --> 03:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
realize that the rules have not even
 
03:59:35.710 --> 03:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
been promulgated yet
 
03:59:39.750 --> 03:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
to allow this to happen and that it will
 
03:59:42.830 --> 03:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
probably be at least another all 18
 
03:59:44.910 --> 03:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
months or so before anything like this
 
03:59:48.790 --> 03:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
can happen and we do have time or do you
 
03:59:54.309 --> 03:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
think we have time to make this uh Bill
 
03:59:57.830 --> 03:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
better I I can't comment exactly on the
 
03:59:59.630 --> 03:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
those time frames you know in terms of
 
04:00:03.309 --> 04:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
the rules or the 18 months um I guess
 
04:00:05.429 --> 04:00:05.439 align:start position:0%
what would be very beneficial to us and
 
04:00:07.750 --> 04:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
and I've uh we we invited you and
 
04:00:10.229 --> 04:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
representative ssuch uh to come speak
 
04:00:12.229 --> 04:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
with our first our sustainability
 
04:00:13.710 --> 04:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
committee we would be very interested to
 
04:00:15.469 --> 04:00:15.479 align:start position:0%
learn we we'd be it'd be great to learn
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
more about the opportunity and then
 
04:00:20.469 --> 04:00:20.479 align:start position:0%
specifically uh representative Kelly
 
04:00:22.070 --> 04:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
Pitts I know you're a sponsor it would
 
04:00:25.030 --> 04:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
be great to learn um why you think this
 
04:00:27.790 --> 04:00:27.800 align:start position:0%
legislation amended or not would help
 
04:00:29.830 --> 04:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
that so that would be a help to us that
 
04:00:31.469 --> 04:00:31.479 align:start position:0%
invitation is there we're meeting this
 
04:00:34.670 --> 04:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
week or another time I Haven cff I
 
04:00:36.309 --> 04:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
haven't received any
 
04:00:39.309 --> 04:00:39.319 align:start position:0%
invitation uh I say I well we can go
 
04:00:41.389 --> 04:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
over it offline be happy to we can go
 
04:00:44.149 --> 04:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
over it offline yeah I email that you
 
04:00:47.950 --> 04:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
late last week but so yeah we we we hope
 
04:00:50.110 --> 04:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
to learn more because we we see the the
 
04:00:52.229 --> 04:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity and the need is there and so
 
04:00:53.830 --> 04:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
the best way to have the legislation
 
04:00:56.550 --> 04:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
reflect that um uh we're certainly open
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
to that learn more thank
 
04:01:02.710 --> 04:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh representative C pitz I
 
04:01:04.189 --> 04:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't have recognized you
 
04:01:06.429 --> 04:01:06.439 align:start position:0%
since you're a for sponsor
 
04:01:08.389 --> 04:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative McGee is I can ask I
 
04:01:11.229 --> 04:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
didn't present
 
04:01:14.910 --> 04:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
though representative o mattered in the
 
04:01:18.790 --> 04:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
past yes you can ask you may you you can
 
04:01:22.670 --> 04:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
ask a question if you don't present
 
04:01:25.710 --> 04:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
correct I thought the rule was that if
 
04:01:27.229 --> 04:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
you're a co-sponsor of the bill you
 
04:01:28.750 --> 04:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
can't answer questions but I'll get a
 
04:01:31.309 --> 04:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
verification of that thank you
 
04:01:32.870 --> 04:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative migy you're recognized
 
04:01:35.110 --> 04:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
for a question yes thank you Mr chair
 
04:01:37.030 --> 04:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
it's actually a point of order about the
 
04:01:38.750 --> 04:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
folks who are waiting in the participant
 
04:01:41.070 --> 04:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
list with their hands up um somebody
 
04:01:43.110 --> 04:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
sent me a text and said that these folks
 
04:01:44.950 --> 04:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
were signed up to speak in the last
 
04:01:46.630 --> 04:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
hearing and the time ran out so they're
 
04:01:48.149 --> 04:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
wondering whether they'll actually be
 
04:01:51.070 --> 04:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledged even though we may not have
 
04:01:54.510 --> 04:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
that list of people who were signed up
 
04:01:55.950 --> 04:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
it may be you know they didn't get to
 
04:01:57.710 --> 04:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
sign up because the link wasn't working
 
04:02:00.389 --> 04:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
today so I guess they're just curious as
 
04:02:04.269 --> 04:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
to whether their last sign up is okay
 
04:02:05.870 --> 04:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
which I don't blame them because they're
 
04:02:07.630 --> 04:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
they're here again trying to you know
 
04:02:12.149 --> 04:02:12.159 align:start position:0%
say what they want to say yes okay if
 
04:02:13.630 --> 04:02:13.640 align:start position:0%
before I answer that question could I
 
04:02:15.510 --> 04:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
just ask people to ask succinct
 
04:02:17.790 --> 04:02:17.800 align:start position:0%
questions rather
 
04:02:21.149 --> 04:02:21.159 align:start position:0%
than going on and on and on and dragging
 
04:02:22.630 --> 04:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
out a question so that I forget what
 
04:02:26.030 --> 04:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
it's about before I even get to the end
 
04:02:27.349 --> 04:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
so the answer to your question
 
04:02:30.070 --> 04:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative McGee is I will allow
 
04:02:33.790 --> 04:02:33.800 align:start position:0%
everyone who has asked to speak to speak
 
04:02:35.830 --> 04:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
even if we're here until five o'clock
 
04:02:35.840 --> 04:02:38.870 align:start position:0%
even if we're here until five o'clock
thank

04:02:38.870 --> 04:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:42.429 --> 04:02:42.439 align:start position:0%
you okay see no one else
 
04:02:47.389 --> 04:02:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:51.349 --> 04:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
of Mr lenb we now turn to the next
 
04:02:55.710 --> 04:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
speaker on the list and that would
 
04:02:55.720 --> 04:02:57.309 align:start position:0%
speaker on the list and that would
be

04:02:57.309 --> 04:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:02:57.319 --> 04:03:04.309 align:start position:0%
be
Rebecca

04:03:04.309 --> 04:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:07.110 --> 04:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
wednes yes Rebecca doesn't want to speak
 
04:03:10.710 --> 04:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
so we'll allow Andrea Hodson to speak
 
04:03:13.269 --> 04:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
Miss Austin hod Hodson you have two
 
04:03:13.279 --> 04:03:14.510 align:start position:0%

minutes

04:03:14.510 --> 04:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
04:03:14.520 --> 04:03:15.309 align:start position:0%
minutes
thank

04:03:15.309 --> 04:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
you uh I'm I'm a member of the
 
04:03:19.590 --> 04:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
Harrisville select board and the
 
04:03:22.389 --> 04:03:22.399 align:start position:0%
electric aggregation committee and uh
 
04:03:25.269 --> 04:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
like Portsmith Harrisville is interested
 
04:03:27.790 --> 04:03:27.800 align:start position:0%
in community power though we may be
 
04:03:30.030 --> 04:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
further along in processing the
 
04:03:32.110 --> 04:03:32.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities and developing our
 
04:03:35.110 --> 04:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
community power plan for a town meeting
 
04:03:39.189 --> 04:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
vote this year we are a small town
 
04:03:42.309 --> 04:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
according to eversource in July we had
 
04:03:46.189 --> 04:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
roughly 950 15 rate payers and we had
 
04:03:49.229 --> 04:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
consumed roughly
 
04:03:52.830 --> 04:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
4,175 megawatts of electricity Supply in
 
04:03:56.630 --> 04:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
a 12-month lookback period so it was
 
04:03:59.309 --> 04:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
incumbent on our committee to evaluate
 
04:04:03.030 --> 04:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
RSA 53e to know whether the community
 
04:04:05.790 --> 04:04:05.800 align:start position:0%
power could be even feasible or in the
 
04:04:08.590 --> 04:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
best interest of a town our size to
 
04:04:10.510 --> 04:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
adopt and
 
04:04:14.510 --> 04:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
240 citizen volunteer hours later
 
04:04:17.189 --> 04:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
we realized that Community power is
 
04:04:20.110 --> 04:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
grounded in our master plan and with the
 
04:04:22.269 --> 04:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
support and input of many of the
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
residents who got involved our work
 
04:04:27.429 --> 04:04:27.439 align:start position:0%
resulted in a community power warrant
 
04:04:30.309 --> 04:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
article to be presented at town meeting
 
04:04:33.429 --> 04:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
we assumed that if the town votes to
 
04:04:36.630 --> 04:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
authorize Community power pu will have
 
04:04:39.469 --> 04:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
done its job of rul making to support
 
04:04:41.830 --> 04:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
our sucessful
 
04:04:45.189 --> 04:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
implementation we did not anticipate new
 
04:04:47.469 --> 04:04:47.479 align:start position:0%
legislation that would effectively
 
04:04:50.309 --> 04:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
reverse and abandon the local control
 
04:04:56.110 --> 04:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
and opportunities promised by RSA 53e 32
 
04:04:58.269 --> 04:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
we respectfully urge you support our
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
Endeavor to implement Community power
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
and not HB 315 thank
 
04:05:06.750 --> 04:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you we appreciate your
 
04:05:09.030 --> 04:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
testimony I especially appreciated your
 
04:05:11.110 --> 04:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony and your inclusion of
 
04:05:14.590 --> 04:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
the Harrisville Community power
 
04:05:18.030 --> 04:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
project plan I actually read the plan
 
04:05:19.950 --> 04:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
and the first thing that struck me about
 
04:05:24.149 --> 04:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
it was that it
 
04:05:28.750 --> 04:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
contains items or materials that make me
 
04:05:31.349 --> 04:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
believe that it would be impossible for
 
04:05:33.189 --> 04:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
the plan to
 
04:05:36.070 --> 04:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
provide electricity to the residents of
 
04:05:39.990 --> 04:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
Harrisville at an affordable rate and I
 
04:05:41.229 --> 04:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
discussed it with a couple of other
 
04:05:43.149 --> 04:05:43.159 align:start position:0%
people and they agreed with that
 
04:05:43.159 --> 04:05:45.030 align:start position:0%
people and they agreed with that
assessment

04:05:45.030 --> 04:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
04:05:48.229 --> 04:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
I would also point out to you that um if
 
04:05:51.269 --> 04:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
you plan to go to town meeting this year
 
04:05:53.229 --> 04:05:53.239 align:start position:0%
rulle making probably won't be done for
 
04:05:54.790 --> 04:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
at least a year
 
04:05:56.910 --> 04:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
your taxpayers want to adopt the plan
 
04:06:03.349 --> 04:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
that may not be implementable for a year
 
04:06:05.189 --> 04:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
or two down the road something for you
 
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
to consider uh are there any other
 
04:06:12.550 --> 04:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:16.269 --> 04:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
Hodson seeing none we will go to our
 
04:06:18.429 --> 04:06:18.439 align:start position:0%
next speaker who is
 
04:06:22.469 --> 04:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
Samuel Golding Mr Golding you have two
 
04:06:24.790 --> 04:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you I'm a resident of
 
04:06:28.149 --> 04:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
conquer and a political Economist and
 
04:06:30.870 --> 04:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
consultant who spent a decade focused on
 
04:06:32.870 --> 04:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
community power Market Development I've
 
04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
been advising the community power
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
Coalition of New Hampshire since late
 
04:06:37.510 --> 04:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
2019 and I
 
04:06:40.670 --> 04:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
previously testimony to this committee
 
04:06:43.630 --> 04:06:43.640 align:start position:0%
the scope of changes uh proposed
 
04:06:46.269 --> 04:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
violates basic Market design principles
 
04:06:48.030 --> 04:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
and would harm the public
 
04:06:50.790 --> 04:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
interest I appreciate how the testimony
 
04:06:52.590 --> 04:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
submitted in support took care to
 
04:06:54.269 --> 04:06:54.279 align:start position:0%
explain some of the thinking behind the
 
04:06:56.830 --> 04:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
bill but it's it's the logic and the
 
04:06:59.189 --> 04:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
reasons stated are actually Incorrect
 
04:07:01.950 --> 04:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to address several here the
 
04:07:03.670 --> 04:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
first is that this bill is necessary to
 
04:07:05.349 --> 04:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
fix major issues preventing the
 
04:07:07.750 --> 04:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
commission from adopting rules that's
 
04:07:11.950 --> 04:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
simply not true there's minor refin make
 
04:07:14.149 --> 04:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
but no disagreements in the workshop shs
 
04:07:16.630 --> 04:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
commission staff are on record saying as
 
04:07:18.750 --> 04:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
much and that rules would be adopted in
 
04:07:20.189 --> 04:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
a matter of
 
04:07:23.349 --> 04:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
weeks before this C and kind of derailed
 
04:07:26.229 --> 04:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
that process supporters apparently
 
04:07:28.309 --> 04:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
believe that the management of wholesale
 
04:07:30.349 --> 04:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
supply and the management and Retail
 
04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
consumption are somehow unrelated and
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
that attempting to do both is a source
 
04:07:37.109 --> 04:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
of risk for communities and that's why
 
04:07:38.830 --> 04:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
they say they want to limit the New
 
04:07:41.149 --> 04:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire aggregators to only focusing
 
04:07:43.710 --> 04:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
on wholesale take away all the ret
 
04:07:45.389 --> 04:07:45.399 align:start position:0%
demand authorities metering billing
 
04:07:46.790 --> 04:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
programs and they think the
 
04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts model should be emulated
 
04:07:51.870 --> 04:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
as a first step in that regard well in
 
04:07:54.109 --> 04:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Municipal aggregators
 
04:07:55.950 --> 04:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
actually receive individual customer
 
04:07:58.429 --> 04:07:58.439 align:start position:0%
account data and usage prior to launch
 
04:08:00.870 --> 04:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
they can pay for Interval meters and
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
communication upgrades they can SE send
 
04:08:06.030 --> 04:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
separate Supply bills for example for
 
04:08:08.469 --> 04:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
large customers very convenient and for
 
04:08:11.030 --> 04:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
Mass market utility Consolidated billing
 
04:08:12.950 --> 04:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
which is already covered by purchase of
 
04:08:13.950 --> 04:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
receivables there
 
04:08:15.469 --> 04:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
they can actually request different rate
 
04:08:16.990 --> 04:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
structures to be programmed into the
 
04:08:19.710 --> 04:08:19.720 align:start position:0%
Utility Billing System they also
 
04:08:23.429 --> 04:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs and programs so
 
04:08:24.910 --> 04:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's happening in
 
04:08:27.429 --> 04:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts well anyway is really a
 
04:08:29.309 --> 04:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
question of the market structure the
 
04:08:33.389 --> 04:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
second is that um you know seconds as
 
04:08:35.590 --> 04:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
vice mayor Cliff Belo
 
04:08:37.910 --> 04:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
explained worked with freedom to put
 
04:08:40.070 --> 04:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
their real-time pricing product and drop
 
04:08:41.710 --> 04:08:41.720 align:start position:0%
their usage at the right time to save
 
04:08:43.670 --> 04:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
money that's supply and demand that's
 
04:08:45.429 --> 04:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
retail and wholesale that's the sort of
 
04:08:47.630 --> 04:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
innovation we want to see and removing
 
04:08:49.750 --> 04:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
those authorities from Community power
 
04:08:52.429 --> 04:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
aggregators is anti- competitive and has
 
04:08:54.830 --> 04:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
no public policy basis or Market design
 
04:08:58.510 --> 04:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
basis okay we appreciate your
 
04:09:00.870 --> 04:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
testimony representative ssuch is
 
04:09:02.510 --> 04:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
04:09:04.950 --> 04:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:09:06.830 --> 04:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr Golding for
 
04:09:10.469 --> 04:09:10.479 align:start position:0%
testifying um and please let me know if
 
04:09:13.590 --> 04:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
I understood your your your testimony
 
04:09:16.229 --> 04:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
corly it seems to me that you're saying
 
04:09:17.389 --> 04:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
that in your
 
04:09:20.830 --> 04:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
opinion uh the current law that was
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
signed in
 
04:09:26.389 --> 04:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
2019 is adequate to be made to work as
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
intended and doesn't really need many
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:36.269 --> 04:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
point my impression is that the
 
04:09:38.950 --> 04:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
commission has the requisite authority
 
04:09:42.510 --> 04:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
to fill in the gaps and uh we were
 
04:09:44.910 --> 04:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
anticipating a draft set of rules that
 
04:09:47.950 --> 04:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
would do that on key issues um which
 
04:09:49.510 --> 04:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
would then and then an adjudicative
 
04:09:54.550 --> 04:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:57.990 --> 04:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
rules okay thank you as Cliff mentioned
 
04:09:59.710 --> 04:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
there are areas that the legislature
 
04:10:03.269 --> 04:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
could clarify but oh okay thank you we
 
04:10:06.070 --> 04:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony Mr Goldie I'll
 
04:10:09.910 --> 04:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
now recognize the next speaker who
 
04:10:14.109 --> 04:10:14.119 align:start position:0%
is Robert Hayden Mr Hayden you have two
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you representative Bose
 
04:10:18.670 --> 04:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you everybody there for your
 
04:10:22.309 --> 04:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
service um standard power works with 60
 
04:10:24.389 --> 04:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
communities here in New Hampshire
 
04:10:26.990 --> 04:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
already for their electricity needs and
 
04:10:29.349 --> 04:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
we've partnered with good a uh good
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
energy to implement Community power we
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
have a contract with Keen already to
 
04:10:38.550 --> 04:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
implement uh Community power and we're
 
04:10:41.830 --> 04:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
well along the way in the process to do
 
04:10:43.830 --> 04:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
that based on the fact
 
04:10:46.990 --> 04:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
that we expected the Pu to have the
 
04:10:49.830 --> 04:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
rules uh made that have been discussed
 
04:10:51.149 --> 04:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
by several other
 
04:10:54.670 --> 04:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
speakers with the Advent of HB
 
04:10:59.550 --> 04:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
315 the ability to implement for Keen
 
04:11:02.910 --> 04:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
has been surely interrupted or slowed
 
04:11:06.990 --> 04:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
down we were at a point where we have
 
04:11:09.469 --> 04:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
already had public Outreach to the
 
04:11:13.830 --> 04:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
community we've provided a sample of a
 
04:11:15.870 --> 04:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
plan to the community that they would be
 
04:11:18.590 --> 04:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
voting on and they are
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
essentially prior to HB 315 we're ready
 
04:11:25.630 --> 04:11:25.640 align:start position:0%
to launch some of the things with HB 315
 
04:11:27.990 --> 04:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we find positive are the fact that
 
04:11:31.469 --> 04:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
it addresses the P issue very important
 
04:11:34.389 --> 04:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
to maintain a high level of supplier
 
04:11:38.590 --> 04:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
participation and in addition um the
 
04:11:42.030 --> 04:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
ability to collect new client data after
 
04:11:43.790 --> 04:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
the launch is positive
 
04:11:45.070 --> 04:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
but on the other side of the coin
 
04:11:46.790 --> 04:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of issues with the
 
04:11:48.870 --> 04:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
bill that make it quite
 
04:11:53.109 --> 04:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
onor uh the utility under the bill as we
 
04:11:55.630 --> 04:11:55.640 align:start position:0%
know it as I haven't read the amendment
 
04:11:57.309 --> 04:11:57.319 align:start position:0%
I haven't had that luxury and I would
 
04:11:59.790 --> 04:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
love to be able to comment again on this
 
04:12:01.229 --> 04:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
matter of fact if there's a committee
 
04:12:03.189 --> 04:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
that does any work on this I would like
 
04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
to be part of it as standard power has a
 
04:12:09.149 --> 04:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
contract with one of our communities
 
04:12:14.429 --> 04:12:14.439 align:start position:0%
already um the cost issue about having
 
04:12:17.149 --> 04:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
no incidental cost be borne by the
 
04:12:20.189 --> 04:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
community is rather difficult it all
 
04:12:23.870 --> 04:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
pretty much elates any participation by
 
04:12:27.389 --> 04:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
the community and Hayden we appreciate
 
04:12:29.710 --> 04:12:29.720 align:start position:0%

04:12:41.389 --> 04:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
program that exists so please have us in

chairman I'm sorry that I'm who I am um
 
04:13:24.990 --> 04:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Hayden you mentioned uh that the no
 
04:13:27.149 --> 04:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
incidental cost was one of the things
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
that you thought was problematic I was
 
04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
sort of writing down your problematic
 
04:13:34.189 --> 04:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
not problem did you have other items you
 
04:13:36.510 --> 04:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
could give us quickly that you feel are
 
04:13:38.429 --> 04:13:38.439 align:start position:0%
problematic so that we have that
 
04:13:43.429 --> 04:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
information well I think all of the
 
04:13:47.510 --> 04:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
constrictions on future Innovation are
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
IM impossible to deal with really it's
 
04:13:52.269 --> 04:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
that there's so many wonderful things
 
04:13:54.870 --> 04:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
that the bill as written the law as
 
04:13:57.950 --> 04:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
written you know 53e could do for our
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
communities in their opportunity to
 
04:14:02.349 --> 04:14:02.359 align:start position:0%
reduce costs while increasing the
 
04:14:04.389 --> 04:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
proliferation of Renewable Power in
 
04:14:06.950 --> 04:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
their portfolio that leads to the goals
 
04:14:09.910 --> 04:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
of communities like Keen who have a 100%
 
04:14:12.429 --> 04:14:12.439 align:start position:0%
goal conquered and other communities
 
04:14:15.149 --> 04:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
also have the these 100% goals that lead
 
04:14:16.950 --> 04:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
to a cleaner Greener future that
 
04:14:19.349 --> 04:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
supports not only the New Hampshire
 
04:14:23.109 --> 04:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
economy but the ecology the education
 
04:14:23.119 --> 04:14:23.990 align:start position:0%
economy but the ecology the education
and

04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:26.070 --> 04:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
jobs thank you for the question and I'm
 
04:14:27.260 --> 04:14:27.270 align:start position:0%
looking forward to the next
 
04:14:27.270 --> 04:14:29.070 align:start position:0%
looking forward to the next

[Music]
 
04:14:31.469 --> 04:14:31.479 align:start position:0%
question representative ssuch is
 
04:14:34.710 --> 04:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question yes uh thank
 
04:14:36.790 --> 04:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you Mr Hayden
 
04:14:41.229 --> 04:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
for taking the my my question uh my
 
04:14:44.149 --> 04:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
question to you is would you character
 
04:14:49.389 --> 04:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
um this bill HB 315 as anti- Innovative
 
04:14:49.399 --> 04:14:51.590 align:start position:0%
um this bill HB 315 as anti- Innovative
and

04:14:51.590 --> 04:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:53.349 --> 04:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive uh that's a great
 
04:14:56.990 --> 04:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
question Peter I really appreciate it um
 
04:14:58.830 --> 04:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
I I think that as
 
04:15:02.630 --> 04:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
written it is anti- innovation there's a
 
04:15:05.830 --> 04:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
surely a future where the utilities will
 
04:15:09.030 --> 04:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to monetize the
 
04:15:13.189 --> 04:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
two-way flow of energy from Storage to
 
04:15:17.309 --> 04:15:17.319 align:start position:0%
generation to usage and to the um
 
04:15:19.710 --> 04:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
virtual battery that all of our storage
 
04:15:22.389 --> 04:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
at home and our cars and our power walls
 
04:15:25.229 --> 04:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
will create that future is a future
 
04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
that's on the way and it'll sweep ac
 
04:15:30.429 --> 04:15:30.439 align:start position:0%
across the country as we will see in the
 
04:15:33.030 --> 04:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
near future so the ability to be on
 
04:15:35.750 --> 04:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
track with those things is incredibly
 
04:15:37.950 --> 04:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
important to not only New Hampshire but
 
04:15:39.469 --> 04:15:39.479 align:start position:0%
all of New England across the New
 
04:15:43.269 --> 04:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:44.910 --> 04:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative crean is
 
04:15:47.389 --> 04:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
04:15:49.389 --> 04:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you Mr Hayden for
 
04:15:51.750 --> 04:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in your testimony
 
04:15:54.149 --> 04:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
you mentioned appreciating that the bill
 
04:15:56.950 --> 04:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
resolves the P issue can you just um
 
04:15:58.710 --> 04:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit more to that what
 
04:16:00.590 --> 04:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
that issue was and and how the bill
 
04:16:03.030 --> 04:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
resolves it uh thank you very much for
 
04:16:05.389 --> 04:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
the question and thank you for your time
 
04:16:07.349 --> 04:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
and service I have had not had the
 
04:16:09.510 --> 04:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
pleasure of meeting with you yet but I
 
04:16:11.070 --> 04:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
do look forward to working with you in
 
04:16:15.429 --> 04:16:15.439 align:start position:0%
the future um I think that the
 
04:16:19.590 --> 04:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
PO language is incredibly important and
 
04:16:22.149 --> 04:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
if we have the pleasure of um dropping
 
04:16:24.830 --> 04:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
this bill we would strongly encourage it
 
04:16:26.229 --> 04:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
be moved to
 
04:16:28.229 --> 04:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
sb91 section
 
04:16:33.550 --> 04:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
3 um but as it is now without po which
 
04:16:38.349 --> 04:16:38.359 align:start position:0%
is a mechanism by way that the utility
 
04:16:41.189 --> 04:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
purchases uh folks who are way behind on
 
04:16:43.070 --> 04:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
their bills they purchase that
 
04:16:45.750 --> 04:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
receivable account and pay the supplier
 
04:16:50.070 --> 04:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
or the entity a discounted value for it
 
04:16:53.670 --> 04:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
so right now um a supplier is in a very
 
04:16:57.510 --> 04:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
bad position to collect um back
 
04:17:01.910 --> 04:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
debt and with po they would receive that
 
04:17:06.109 --> 04:17:06.119 align:start position:0%
discounted value for all bad debt that
 
04:17:09.149 --> 04:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
way suppliers would be more likely to
 
04:17:13.030 --> 04:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
participate in this program one of the
 
04:17:15.030 --> 04:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
primary suppliers in New Hampshire is a
 
04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
company called constellation and it
 
04:17:20.189 --> 04:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
appears as though the only reason
 
04:17:22.189 --> 04:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
they're choosing not to participate at
 
04:17:25.389 --> 04:17:25.399 align:start position:0%
this time is the lack of P which much of
 
04:17:27.870 --> 04:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
the country who's implemented um
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
Community power programs has included in
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
their law
 
04:17:33.840 --> 04:17:37.070 align:start position:0%
their law
language

04:17:37.070 --> 04:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:41.670 --> 04:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
next you have representative cran nope
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
I'm all that thank you very much
 
04:17:46.750 --> 04:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
okay she's all set and so are we so
 
04:17:48.910 --> 04:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Hayden we look forward to
 
04:17:51.269 --> 04:17:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh working with you on this
 
04:17:54.030 --> 04:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
uh on this legislation thank you
 
04:17:55.510 --> 04:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative Vose and thank you for
 
04:17:55.520 --> 04:17:56.189 align:start position:0%
representative Vose and thank you for
your

04:17:56.189 --> 04:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:18:00.710 --> 04:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
time next I'll call on uh Jennifer Smith
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
Miss Smith you have two
 
04:18:05.469 --> 04:18:05.479 align:start position:0%
minutes okay thank you Mr chairman
 
04:18:07.469 --> 04:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I first want
 
04:18:09.389 --> 04:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
to note that I was signed up to speak on
 
04:18:11.590 --> 04:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
the previous bill but I had to sign back
 
04:18:13.309 --> 04:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
out and sign back in by the time I
 
04:18:14.950 --> 04:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
signed back in you had closed the
 
04:18:16.910 --> 04:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
hearing um I think you know it would
 
04:18:18.790 --> 04:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
have been simple enough to unmute me and
 
04:18:22.269 --> 04:18:22.279 align:start position:0%
ask who I was but in any case I I would
 
04:18:24.710 --> 04:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
have appreciated talking on that bill
 
04:18:26.510 --> 04:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
this bill I am a member of energy
 
04:18:29.510 --> 04:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
Committee in Penbrook New Hampshire um I
 
04:18:31.389 --> 04:18:31.399 align:start position:0%
don't know that we're ready to begin
 
04:18:33.229 --> 04:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
thinking about this but I'm distressed
 
04:18:35.830 --> 04:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
to think that a bill like this will in
 
04:18:39.109 --> 04:18:39.119 align:start position:0%
fact delay the Pu issuing rules which I
 
04:18:42.149 --> 04:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
was waiting on to see before I started
 
04:18:44.590 --> 04:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
talking to other members of our energy
 
04:18:47.590 --> 04:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
committee and to the town select board
 
04:18:51.269 --> 04:18:51.279 align:start position:0%
about this um opportunity we do have a
 
04:18:54.670 --> 04:18:54.680 align:start position:0%
um pilot agreement with a so commercial
 
04:18:58.070 --> 04:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
solar um going in in the near future and
 
04:19:00.710 --> 04:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
it would be a wonderful opportunity to
 
04:19:03.189 --> 04:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
um add value kind of value stacking sort
 
04:19:06.550 --> 04:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
of thing um so I would appreciate it if
 
04:19:10.790 --> 04:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
this bill was just retained um and you
 
04:19:13.429 --> 04:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
work with the Senate energy committee to
 
04:19:16.750 --> 04:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
do any fixes that Mr Bel and others can
 
04:19:19.550 --> 04:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
agree to and not spend a lot of time on
 
04:19:21.750 --> 04:19:21.760 align:start position:0%

questions oh okay haven't gotten

minutes thank you very much uh chairman
 
04:19:58.670 --> 04:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
my name is Rebecca McKenzie and I'm a
 
04:20:01.630 --> 04:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
member of the energy advisory committee
 
04:20:03.229 --> 04:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
in Claremont New
 
04:20:05.830 --> 04:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I agree with claremont's mayor
 
04:20:10.269 --> 04:20:10.279 align:start position:0%
Charlene LoveIt who publicly opposed HB
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
315 I am here to respectfully
 
04:20:16.109 --> 04:20:16.119 align:start position:0%
request that you vote inexpedient to
 
04:20:19.910 --> 04:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
legislate on HB 315 for many of the
 
04:20:23.030 --> 04:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
reasons that have already been stated I
 
04:20:25.349 --> 04:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
attended the first hearing was surprised
 
04:20:27.990 --> 04:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
to hear that some say that Community
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
power and Community aggregation are two
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
different things it is my understanding
 
04:20:35.469 --> 04:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
that Community power and Community
 
04:20:38.830 --> 04:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
aggregation are the same I hope that
 
04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
this important issue continues to be
 
04:20:40.800 --> 04:20:43.030 align:start position:0%
this important issue continues to be
clarified

04:20:43.030 --> 04:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
04:20:45.590 --> 04:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
the reason Claremont continues to
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
research Community power is because we
 
04:20:50.790 --> 04:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
would like the option to choose the most
 
04:20:53.910 --> 04:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
economically available electric power
 
04:20:56.349 --> 04:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
source the option to choose from a
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
variety of renewable energy
 
04:21:01.469 --> 04:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
sources be able to transition to
 
04:21:03.550 --> 04:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
community power without having to
 
04:21:06.469 --> 04:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
reinvent a customer base that would make
 
04:21:06.479 --> 04:21:08.030 align:start position:0%
reinvent a customer base that would make
it

04:21:08.030 --> 04:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:21:11.550 --> 04:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
viable and the opportunity to build more
 
04:21:14.070 --> 04:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
self-reliance with local power
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
generation Claremont businesses
 
04:21:19.349 --> 04:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and the municipality continue
 
04:21:22.429 --> 04:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
to invest in local renewable energy and
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
HB 3155 undermines all these options and
 
04:21:28.950 --> 04:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
forces New Hampshire to settle for the
 
04:21:32.349 --> 04:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
inadequate model of community power also
 
04:21:35.550 --> 04:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
known as the mass Massachusetts
 
04:21:38.790 --> 04:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
model we are looking for looking into
 
04:21:40.510 --> 04:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
Community power options that would
 
04:21:43.309 --> 04:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
increase our competitive buying power
 
04:21:45.469 --> 04:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
collaborating with many other New
 
04:21:48.149 --> 04:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire municipalities to reduce the
 
04:21:50.750 --> 04:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
cost of electricity as well as other
 
04:21:54.189 --> 04:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
options that Community power provides
 
04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
our energy advisory committee recently
 
04:21:59.950 --> 04:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
took an energy resilience prod project
 
04:22:02.950 --> 04:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
as part of our portfolio of work for the
 
04:22:05.590 --> 04:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
upcoming foreseeable future we
 
04:22:07.229 --> 04:22:07.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony thank you for
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%

want to get the most economical power
 
04:22:26.870 --> 04:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
for your your town uh would that be then
 
04:22:28.630 --> 04:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
that be the bottom line I believe
 
04:22:33.030 --> 04:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:35.229 --> 04:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor I thought as a co-sponsor I
 
04:22:36.550 --> 04:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
could speak I thought it was just the
 
04:22:39.469 --> 04:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor am I couldn't speak so I'd

coming to testify um let me ask you uh
 
04:23:17.109 --> 04:23:17.119 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a a community question
 
04:23:20.469 --> 04:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh do you believe that this opportunity
 
04:23:23.710 --> 04:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
for Community power is a motivating
 
04:23:26.710 --> 04:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
factor in your community uh for being
 
04:23:28.790 --> 04:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
able to take some local control about
 
04:23:32.790 --> 04:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
your energy use absolutely we're so much
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
looking forward to uh becoming more uh
 
04:23:43.070 --> 04:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
um educated and involved in this
 
04:23:46.950 --> 04:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh special opportunity for creating um
 
04:23:50.910 --> 04:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
energy Innovation and also economic uh
 
04:23:52.830 --> 04:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
Advantage for our community our
 
04:23:56.229 --> 04:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
community is a community that has a 14%
 
04:24:01.790 --> 04:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
poverty rate and uh absolutely the uh
 
04:24:04.750 --> 04:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
expense of energy if at all possible to
 
04:24:06.670 --> 04:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
be reduced in our community would be
 
04:24:09.910 --> 04:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
very important thank you for asking
 
04:24:09.920 --> 04:24:11.349 align:start position:0%

House Bill 315
 
04:25:15.870 --> 04:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
the city of Kean has a long history of
 
04:25:17.870 --> 04:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
prioritizing initiatives that protect
 
04:25:20.790 --> 04:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
our environment and our quality of life
 
04:25:24.229 --> 04:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
in 2017 the Keen city council adopted an
 
04:25:26.630 --> 04:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
energy resolution which among other
 
04:25:28.670 --> 04:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
things sets us on a path for sourcing
 
04:25:31.950 --> 04:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
100% of of our electricity for the
 
04:25:34.269 --> 04:25:34.279 align:start position:0%

2030 just last month the council adopted
 
04:25:40.910 --> 04:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
an energy plan charting the path forward
 
04:25:43.349 --> 04:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
Community power or AG ation is
 
04:25:45.950 --> 04:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
identified as the single biggest tool
 
04:25:48.109 --> 04:25:48.119 align:start position:0%
available to move our community towards
 
04:25:51.269 --> 04:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
that goal in Keen we have both an active
 
04:25:53.710 --> 04:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
energy Community Committee and Community
 
04:25:56.030 --> 04:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
power committee we have a draft
 
04:25:57.950 --> 04:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
Community power plan and have been
 
04:26:00.070 --> 04:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
engaging the public in Outreach efforts
 
04:26:02.910 --> 04:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
around this plan we are well on our way
 
04:26:04.790 --> 04:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
to adopting a community power
 
04:26:06.870 --> 04:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
aggregation plan for businesses and
 
04:26:09.269 --> 04:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
residents all located within the city
 
04:26:11.550 --> 04:26:11.560 align:start position:0%
boundaries and if you have a chance go
 
04:26:14.710 --> 04:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
to our our website at ke ke Community
 
04:26:18.149 --> 04:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
power.com and review that plan we have
 
04:26:20.950 --> 04:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
concerns related to accessing uh the
 
04:26:22.670 --> 04:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
customer data information that you've
 
04:26:25.469 --> 04:26:25.479 align:start position:0%
heard many times already in testimony as
 
04:26:28.269 --> 04:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
well as the ability to use our staff to
 
04:26:30.830 --> 04:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
bring forward the plan for our community
 
04:26:34.309 --> 04:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
to consider and I'm happy to answer any
 
04:26:36.750 --> 04:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
questions that you may
 
04:26:39.149 --> 04:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much we appreciate
 
04:26:42.590 --> 04:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony I have a question for you
 
04:26:45.429 --> 04:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
you think that the city of keen and the
 
04:26:46.910 --> 04:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
you can't ask a
 
04:26:49.469 --> 04:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
question oh are you a pro sponsor oh
 
04:26:51.389 --> 04:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
that's right I'm a sponsor you're the
 
04:26:51.399 --> 04:26:53.590 align:start position:0%
that's right I'm a sponsor you're the
prime

04:26:53.590 --> 04:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
prime
 
04:26:56.469 --> 04:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
sponsor all right you're right I can't
 
04:26:59.910 --> 04:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
ask a question nobody else has a a hand
 
04:27:01.830 --> 04:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
up to ask a question so we'll move to
 
04:27:04.429 --> 04:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
the next Mr chair
 
04:27:06.670 --> 04:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
yes oh I'm sorry there is someone who
 
04:27:08.590 --> 04:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
has their hand up representative cam
 
04:27:11.510 --> 04:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
brills is recognized for a question yes
 
04:27:14.229 --> 04:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh I keep hearing the terms Community
 
04:27:17.870 --> 04:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
aggregation and Community power my
 
04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
understanding of it some people have
 
04:27:22.189 --> 04:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
said that it means exactly the same
 
04:27:24.910 --> 04:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
thing but others have said that
 
04:27:28.389 --> 04:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
Community aggregation is a lot simpler
 
04:27:30.229 --> 04:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
thing whereby
 
04:27:32.990 --> 04:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
communities pull their resources
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
together so that they can buy make
 
04:27:38.550 --> 04:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
contracts and get energy whereas
 
04:27:41.189 --> 04:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
Community power it's a lot more
 
04:27:43.189 --> 04:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
complicated where actually generating
 
04:27:46.550 --> 04:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
electricity and no they therefore have
 
04:27:48.750 --> 04:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh other obligations since you're
 
04:27:50.550 --> 04:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
generating could you
 
04:27:54.149 --> 04:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
maybe give a definition of the two or
 
04:27:57.429 --> 04:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
are they in fact one of the same thank
 
04:28:00.229 --> 04:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
you so it's my understanding that
 
04:28:02.790 --> 04:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
Community power is using the community
 
04:28:07.149 --> 04:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
aggregation uh law and in our case our
 
04:28:10.750 --> 04:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
community draft plan um talks about
 
04:28:14.269 --> 04:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
basically going out to bid for that
 
04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
electric um service for our community
 
04:28:19.750 --> 04:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
and so it's not creating our own power
 
04:28:22.910 --> 04:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
and then selling it it's aggregating all
 
04:28:24.990 --> 04:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
of our businesses and our residences
 
04:28:28.229 --> 04:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
into one pool so that they can get a
 
04:28:30.910 --> 04:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
better um a better cost for their
 
04:28:33.469 --> 04:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
electricity and in addition to that we
 
04:28:35.550 --> 04:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
have options which will move the
 
04:28:38.670 --> 04:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
community gradually to more renewable
 
04:28:41.550 --> 04:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
energy over a period of time and we've
 
04:28:44.229 --> 04:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
surveyed our community to determine what
 
04:28:46.830 --> 04:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
level of renewable energy they're
 
04:28:49.389 --> 04:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
willing to pay for and at what cost and
 
04:28:52.830 --> 04:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
so it is aggregation of power um and
 
04:28:55.349 --> 04:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
then going out to bid for that
 
04:28:59.670 --> 04:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:04.269 --> 04:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
you so you no further questions for
 
04:29:09.070 --> 04:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
IT Miss Dragon we'll move on and I will
 
04:29:12.630 --> 04:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
recognize Phillip Stevenson Mr Stevenson
 
04:29:14.950 --> 04:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
you have two
 
04:29:17.830 --> 04:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
minutes uh thank you chair and thank you
 
04:29:19.550 --> 04:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh committee members for listening to me
 
04:29:21.149 --> 04:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
I'm a private citizen and energy
 
04:29:22.870 --> 04:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
consultant I live in Hollis New
 
04:29:26.309 --> 04:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I oppose HB 315 and I'm
 
04:29:30.109 --> 04:29:30.119 align:start position:0%
asking you to um vote at itl um I moved
 
04:29:31.790 --> 04:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire a year and a half ago
 
04:29:33.550 --> 04:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
and was impressed to learn about the
 
04:29:35.149 --> 04:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
community power law that had just been
 
04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
passed RSA 53e um smart bipartisan
 
04:29:40.349 --> 04:29:40.359 align:start position:0%
legislation that was putting energy
 
04:29:43.349 --> 04:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
Innovation at the Forefront in the state
 
04:29:47.710 --> 04:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
um and HB 315 would destroy that um as
 
04:29:50.070 --> 04:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
written including with the amendment uh
 
04:29:53.550 --> 04:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
which only only sort of um in a small
 
04:29:55.710 --> 04:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
way undo the damage to to what was a
 
04:29:55.720 --> 04:29:56.510 align:start position:0%
way undo the damage to to what was a
very

04:29:56.510 --> 04:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:29:59.469 --> 04:29:59.479 align:start position:0%
Innovative um piece of legislation the
 
04:30:01.070 --> 04:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
rest of the country right now is mostly
 
04:30:03.229 --> 04:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
divided into states where on the one and
 
04:30:05.189 --> 04:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
Monopoly utilities completely manage the
 
04:30:07.189 --> 04:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
power system and on the other state
 
04:30:09.670 --> 04:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
legislators are making all the decisions
 
04:30:12.109 --> 04:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
in 2019 New Hampshire carbed its own
 
04:30:14.710 --> 04:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
Innovative path of bringing the power
 
04:30:18.550 --> 04:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
back to the local level uh bad pun there
 
04:30:22.149 --> 04:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
um and I'd ask that you not undo that
 
04:30:24.510 --> 04:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
progress um I'd also just like to note
 
04:30:28.070 --> 04:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
that I am a an observer a recent because
 
04:30:29.469 --> 04:30:29.479 align:start position:0%
I have only recently joined but would
 
04:30:31.750 --> 04:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
like to become a part of Hollis uh's
 
04:30:35.790 --> 04:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
energy committee uh and when I um they
 
04:30:37.910 --> 04:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
have also submitted comments so while
 
04:30:39.389 --> 04:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
Hollis doesn't show up as a committee
 
04:30:41.630 --> 04:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
that has signed on to community power uh
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
they have written comments to all of you
 
04:30:45.950 --> 04:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
that include uh the concerns about this
 
04:30:48.109 --> 04:30:48.119 align:start position:0%
HP 315 being anti- Innovative
 
04:30:50.070 --> 04:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive and diminishing access
 
04:30:53.790 --> 04:30:53.800 align:start position:0%
to competitive rates um and I would I
 
04:30:55.469 --> 04:30:55.479 align:start position:0%
would emphasize that that is the issue I
 
04:30:56.990 --> 04:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
I think that we should move this
 
04:31:01.790 --> 04:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
conversation from HB 315 back to RSA 53e
 
04:31:04.830 --> 04:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
and ask ourselves what are we trying to
 
04:31:07.950 --> 04:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
achieve uh RSA 53e had very clear
 
04:31:10.149 --> 04:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
objectives which is bringing the power
 
04:31:12.950 --> 04:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
back to the taking the natural monopoly
 
04:31:14.670 --> 04:31:14.680 align:start position:0%
components and separating them from the
 
04:31:16.950 --> 04:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
non- Monopoly components of our
 
04:31:19.109 --> 04:31:19.119 align:start position:0%
electricity system which is a great
 
04:31:21.630 --> 04:31:21.640 align:start position:0%
thing and allows us to have local
 
04:31:24.550 --> 04:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
communities private organizations being
 
04:31:26.790 --> 04:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
Innovative on the parts that are
 
04:31:29.710 --> 04:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
not manage the actual management of the
 
04:31:32.429 --> 04:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
electrical system so let's ask ourselves
 
04:31:34.710 --> 04:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
what are we trying to actually achieve
 
04:31:36.189 --> 04:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
and as of the Senate bill and dealing
 
04:31:38.309 --> 04:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
with issues like P let's focus on those
 
04:31:39.910 --> 04:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
and get them fixed together as was
 
04:31:42.309 --> 04:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
happening in the ru making this bill was
 
04:31:44.229 --> 04:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
brought by one party who's unsatisfied
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
with the compromise level made so far
 
04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
let's get back to the table on the
 
04:31:50.990 --> 04:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
original Law and not try to overhaul it
 
04:31:53.109 --> 04:31:53.119 align:start position:0%
this way um thank you all and appreciate
 
04:31:55.830 --> 04:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
any questions you have for me thank you
 
04:31:58.349 --> 04:31:58.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony although you
 
04:32:01.030 --> 04:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
were a little longwinded
 
04:32:04.510 --> 04:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh no more so than you sir I don't see
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
any hands raised for questions so we
 
04:32:08.910 --> 04:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
will uh move
 
04:32:13.269 --> 04:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
on next person on the list is Howard
 
04:32:18.229 --> 04:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
KET or C Mr KET or k you have the floor
 
04:32:21.870 --> 04:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:24.389 --> 04:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr
 
04:32:24.399 --> 04:32:26.429 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr
chairman

04:32:26.429 --> 04:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:32:29.790 --> 04:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
um first of and uh also want to thank
 
04:32:31.950 --> 04:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
committee members as a resident of Ryan
 
04:32:34.189 --> 04:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
the energy committee I oppose the house
 
04:32:34.199 --> 04:32:35.109 align:start position:0%
the energy committee I oppose the house
bill

04:32:35.109 --> 04:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:32:37.670 --> 04:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
315 Community power and Community
 
04:32:41.070 --> 04:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
aggregation are the same Community power
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
provides an opportunity to provide local
 
04:32:47.229 --> 04:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
control renewable energy and Innovation
 
04:32:50.950 --> 04:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
and direction to all residents of Ry as
 
04:32:53.149 --> 04:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
a resident and energy Committee of Ry we
 
04:32:55.269 --> 04:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
have been forming plans to take
 
04:32:57.750 --> 04:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
advantage of RSA
 
04:33:01.269 --> 04:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
53e which is now threatened by HP
 
04:33:04.029 --> 04:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
315 there's been much discussion today
 
04:33:06.429 --> 04:33:06.439 align:start position:0%
by those much more knowledgeable than
 
04:33:08.830 --> 04:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
myself but I do want to include my
 
04:33:11.789 --> 04:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
concerns put them on the table I do
 
04:33:15.510 --> 04:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
support comments from Mr Belo and Mr Len
 
04:33:17.551 --> 04:33:17.561 align:start position:0%
uh find a lot of similarities in what
 
04:33:17.561 --> 04:33:19.109 align:start position:0%
uh find a lot of similarities in what
they've

04:33:19.109 --> 04:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
they've
 
04:33:21.869 --> 04:33:21.879 align:start position:0%
said the ability to lower costs by
 
04:33:24.390 --> 04:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
purchasing power on a wholesale basis is
 
04:33:26.949 --> 04:33:26.959 align:start position:0%
key additionally power could come from
 
04:33:29.869 --> 04:33:29.879 align:start position:0%
local sources Renewables green energy
 
04:33:33.949 --> 04:33:33.959 align:start position:0%
suppliers note that local power
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
reduces uh capacity demands and
 
04:33:39.990 --> 04:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
transmission costs large customers have
 
04:33:43.470 --> 04:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
the access to competitive markets small
 
04:33:46.590 --> 04:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
customers simply do not have this access
 
04:33:48.750 --> 04:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
large customers have interval
 
04:33:51.269 --> 04:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
metering to better understand usage and
 
04:33:53.949 --> 04:33:53.959 align:start position:0%
lower costs once again smaller customers
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
do not have this option and other load
 
04:33:59.470 --> 04:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
management oportunities the most
 
04:34:02.949 --> 04:34:02.959 align:start position:0%
expensive power is at Peak energy usage
 
04:34:06.349 --> 04:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
periods HP 315 would not specifically
 
04:34:08.629 --> 04:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
encourage load management conservation
 
04:34:12.109 --> 04:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
and Energy Efficiency
 
04:34:15.470 --> 04:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
RSA 53e streamlines the enrollment
 
04:34:18.629 --> 04:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
process for utility default service this
 
04:34:21.189 --> 04:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
is a large piece of the community power
 
04:34:24.150 --> 04:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
startup cost I look forward to guidance
 
04:34:26.429 --> 04:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
from others to lead us and allow Ry to
 
04:34:27.750 --> 04:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
reach our
 
04:34:30.429 --> 04:34:30.439 align:start position:0%
goal please do not support this bill and
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
allow other local communities to provide
 
04:34:35.910 --> 04:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
Power at lower costs with Greener
 
04:34:38.510 --> 04:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
potential thank
 
04:34:42.429 --> 04:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh we appreciate your
 
04:34:45.390 --> 04:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for being here thank
 
04:34:48.029 --> 04:34:48.039 align:start position:0%
you for the edification of the committee
 
04:34:50.429 --> 04:34:50.439 align:start position:0%
I just received word from the house
 
04:34:55.189 --> 04:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
clerk that co-sponsors of a bill can ask
 
04:34:58.189 --> 04:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
questions as long as they aren't
 
04:35:01.349 --> 04:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
testifying or asking impertinent
 
04:35:04.390 --> 04:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
questions that was his exact
 
04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
phraseology so I will permit questions
 
04:35:09.709 --> 04:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
from Representatives C pittz
 
04:35:12.551 --> 04:35:12.561 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington representative
 
04:35:17.910 --> 04:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
Thomas and of course myself so with that
 
04:35:20.029 --> 04:35:20.039 align:start position:0%
clarification I see that there are no
 
04:35:24.830 --> 04:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
hands raised for questions of Mr KET so
 
04:35:27.830 --> 04:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
we will now proceed to our next qu
 
04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
presenter who is Annie Henry Miss Henry
 
04:35:44.029 --> 04:35:44.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:47.029 --> 04:35:47.039 align:start position:0%
Miss Henry don't forget to unmute
 
04:35:49.750 --> 04:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
hello thank you this is actually not
 
04:35:52.189 --> 04:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
Annie Henry my name is Dory drachman and
 
04:35:55.629 --> 04:35:55.639 align:start position:0%
I think I've I'm joining through a
 
04:35:58.551 --> 04:35:58.561 align:start position:0%
different Zoom account which labels me
 
04:36:00.869 --> 04:36:00.879 align:start position:0%
as Annie Henry so I am I'm sorry for
 
04:36:03.029 --> 04:36:03.039 align:start position:0%
that for that confusion but my name is
 
04:36:06.949 --> 04:36:06.959 align:start position:0%
Dory drachman and I am from Peterboro
 
04:36:12.629 --> 04:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I am a volunteer
 
04:36:15.789 --> 04:36:15.799 align:start position:0%
with the community power Coalition of
 
04:36:18.150 --> 04:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and also with the manad
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
sustainability Hub a regional nonprofit
 
04:36:25.429 --> 04:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
I am opposed to HB 315 and hope that the
 
04:36:27.910 --> 04:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
committee will deem it
 
04:36:31.629 --> 04:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
itl my main purpose for speaking now is
 
04:36:35.390 --> 04:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
to in a an aggregate sense dispel the
 
04:36:39.150 --> 04:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
idea that was brought up on uh the first
 
04:36:41.590 --> 04:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
part of the hearing that very few
 
04:36:43.109 --> 04:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
communities have shown interest in
 
04:36:48.029 --> 04:36:48.039 align:start position:0%
community power as it exists in RSA
 
04:36:51.269 --> 04:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
53e as you have heard from Individual
 
04:36:55.310 --> 04:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
other communities this is definitely a
 
04:36:59.670 --> 04:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
false um 471 people have signed into
 
04:37:02.230 --> 04:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
this Committee in opposition to the bill
 
04:37:06.230 --> 04:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
whereas only 11 have signed in as uh
 
04:37:10.390 --> 04:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
supporting it um over 700 New Hampshire
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
citizens represent resenting over a 100
 
04:37:15.551 --> 04:37:15.561 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire towns have signed on to a
 
04:37:18.470 --> 04:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
citizen's petition opposing this bill
 
04:37:20.949 --> 04:37:20.959 align:start position:0%
but even more important than those easy
 
04:37:23.670 --> 04:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
steps of just signing your name there
 
04:37:23.680 --> 04:37:24.470 align:start position:0%
steps of just signing your name there
have

04:37:24.470 --> 04:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:37:28.150 --> 04:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
been many many communities that have put
 
04:37:32.269 --> 04:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
in significant time to learn about and
 
04:37:37.189 --> 04:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
move forward with their Community power
 
04:37:40.551 --> 04:37:40.561 align:start position:0%
programs um and as you know it's hard
 
04:37:43.830 --> 04:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's complicated and so it's it it
 
04:37:46.789 --> 04:37:46.799 align:start position:0%
implies a very significant interest in
 
04:37:50.429 --> 04:37:50.439 align:start position:0%
it um in June
 
04:37:55.510 --> 04:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
cpcn uh had held a summit and at that
 
04:37:59.109 --> 04:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
Summit were 86 elected officials staff
 
04:38:01.470 --> 04:38:01.480 align:start position:0%

represented 23 towns five cities and one
 
04:38:09.429 --> 04:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
County it represented all of the all of
 
04:38:10.990 --> 04:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire counties wor
 
04:38:11.000 --> 04:38:12.349 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire counties wor
represented

04:38:12.349 --> 04:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
represented
 
04:38:16.349 --> 04:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
and significantly it represented 25% of
 
04:38:20.230 --> 04:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
the Statewide utility load 30
 
04:38:23.230 --> 04:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
seconds with with the madn
 
04:38:26.590 --> 04:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
sustainability Hub we have been um we
 
04:38:30.590 --> 04:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
have offering Regional meetings and have
 
04:38:34.429 --> 04:38:34.439 align:start position:0%

uh two of which you've heard today
 
04:38:40.029 --> 04:38:40.039 align:start position:0%
Harrisville and Keen have already been
 
04:38:42.990 --> 04:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
um moving forward with their plans and
 
04:38:45.990 --> 04:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
the others are very interested in the
 
04:38:48.590 --> 04:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
bill that has already or in the law that
 
04:38:51.789 --> 04:38:51.799 align:start position:0%
has already been passed and it has it is
 
04:38:53.830 --> 04:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
through those Innovations in the current
 
04:38:56.869 --> 04:38:56.879 align:start position:0%
law that get most of our communities
 
04:38:59.949 --> 04:38:59.959 align:start position:0%
very excited okay thank you much glad to
 
04:39:02.189 --> 04:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
hear there are excited communities out
 
04:39:06.109 --> 04:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
there are there any questions for M
 
04:39:10.310 --> 04:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh dman dman sorry I forgot your name
 
04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't see it on the screen okay you
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
don't have it written in front of you
 
04:39:16.070 --> 04:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative Cali pittz is recognized
 
04:39:19.949 --> 04:39:19.959 align:start position:0%
for a question miss dman when yes you
 
04:39:22.109 --> 04:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
talk about Community power and that the
 
04:39:24.269 --> 04:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
community is interested that's either
 
04:39:26.510 --> 04:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
the town or the county
 
04:39:29.670 --> 04:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
municipality would the town County or
 
04:39:33.869 --> 04:39:33.879 align:start position:0%
municipality have to take every customer
 
04:39:37.430 --> 04:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
into their system including those
 
04:39:37.440 --> 04:39:39.230 align:start position:0%
into their system including those
customers

04:39:39.230 --> 04:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:39:42.030 --> 04:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
who sometimes default on their
 
04:39:45.430 --> 04:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
payments or can't afford the payments
 
04:39:50.150 --> 04:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
that is gonna it's just a
 
04:39:54.030 --> 04:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
question yes so and a fair question um
 
04:39:57.990 --> 04:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
so yes it is an OP out program so that
 
04:40:01.948 --> 04:40:01.958 align:start position:0%
anybody who is currently on the default
 
04:40:06.190 --> 04:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
utility uh account would then be in the
 
04:40:09.070 --> 04:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
community power program including those
 
04:40:12.150 --> 04:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
that don't have um the the best record
 
04:40:14.990 --> 04:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
of of ontime payments but that's where
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
this P I believe those are the initials
 
04:40:23.788 --> 04:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
uh uh Amendment come in and it gives the
 
04:40:27.948 --> 04:40:27.958 align:start position:0%
community power um program the same
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
right that the utility does to recoup
 
04:40:34.350 --> 04:40:34.360 align:start position:0%
the the Mis
 
04:40:38.948 --> 04:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:44.150 --> 04:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
payments can I follow up follow up I I I
 
04:40:45.910 --> 04:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
just want you to follow up with that and
 
04:40:50.230 --> 04:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
think that someone who lives in a
 
04:40:53.590 --> 04:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
town pays their taxes but runs into
 
04:40:56.830 --> 04:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
trouble with with um paying the electric
 
04:41:00.948 --> 04:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
bill whatever uh is going to be treated
 
04:41:03.030 --> 04:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
differently than
 
04:41:06.270 --> 04:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
somebody who pays their taxes and does
 
04:41:08.948 --> 04:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
pay their electric bill so that the same
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
benefits that the town offers through
 
04:41:14.830 --> 04:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
some of the tax money which would be
 
04:41:18.030 --> 04:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
startup and ever wouldn't be available
 
04:41:22.708 --> 04:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
to that person so I I wonder how does
 
04:41:25.910 --> 04:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
that work as are those the kinds of
 
04:41:29.708 --> 04:41:29.718 align:start position:0%
things that the Pu is trying to work
 
04:41:34.070 --> 04:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
out so so I I need to be honest that I'm
 
04:41:36.868 --> 04:41:36.878 align:start position:0%
not an expert on the Pu and so I would
 
04:41:39.948 --> 04:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
leave that that to other people who know
 
04:41:42.270 --> 04:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
more about that I was not trying to
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
communicate that that that people who
 
04:41:46.350 --> 04:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't pay their bills would be
 
04:41:47.990 --> 04:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
treated differently in fact I was trying
 
04:41:50.310 --> 04:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
to say that they would be treated the
 
04:41:55.030 --> 04:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
same and that we would be accepting all
 
04:41:59.230 --> 04:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
all rate payers and would have the same
 
04:42:01.708 --> 04:42:01.718 align:start position:0%
uh recourses that a utility that the
 
04:42:04.310 --> 04:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
utility has now um that was what I was
 
04:42:06.990 --> 04:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
trying to communicate and I'm sorry if
 
04:42:09.910 --> 04:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
that wasn't clear thank
 
04:42:13.430 --> 04:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:15.430 --> 04:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Thomas has
 
04:42:17.788 --> 04:42:17.798 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you Mr
 
04:42:20.070 --> 04:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:42:23.948 --> 04:42:23.958 align:start position:0%
um since we just heard um that there was
 
04:42:26.110 --> 04:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
no difference between Community power
 
04:42:27.350 --> 04:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
and Community
 
04:42:30.430 --> 04:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
ucation uh to avoid further confusion
 
04:42:32.470 --> 04:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
would you be opposed if we just struck
 
04:42:34.670 --> 04:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
out the word Community power throughout
 
04:42:36.750 --> 04:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
the entire Bill and just stuck with
 
04:42:38.910 --> 04:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
community agregation so we don't have
 
04:42:40.830 --> 04:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
ask these these questions keep being
 
04:42:43.190 --> 04:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
answered what the difference is since
 
04:42:45.230 --> 04:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
there is
 
04:42:48.590 --> 04:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
none so I can give you my opinion I
 
04:42:50.750 --> 04:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
would like to keep the term Community
 
04:42:53.628 --> 04:42:53.638 align:start position:0%
power for a couple of reasons one is
 
04:42:55.590 --> 04:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
that it has now been a year and a half
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
since the the law has been in effect and
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's what people know about in New
 
04:43:05.310 --> 04:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they know Community power my
 
04:43:08.270 --> 04:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is that um Clifton Belo
 
04:43:11.628 --> 04:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
who was the primary author of of that
 
04:43:15.030 --> 04:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
bill chose the term Community power
 
04:43:17.230 --> 04:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
because it is a more accessible term
 
04:43:20.990 --> 04:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
than Community aggregation it has um
 
04:43:23.788 --> 04:43:23.798 align:start position:0%
people can understand it more than what
 
04:43:27.708 --> 04:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
you mean by aggregation I think that the
 
04:43:30.830 --> 04:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
um I think that the confusion comes in
 
04:43:33.310 --> 04:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
that there are just like in community
 
04:43:36.270 --> 04:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
aggregation there are different models
 
04:43:41.270 --> 04:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
of it and what this law does is this
 
04:43:46.110 --> 04:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
is a very Innovative model of community
 
04:43:49.510 --> 04:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
aggregation it allows towns and other
 
04:43:53.910 --> 04:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities to to really be you know
 
04:43:56.788 --> 04:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
the the authors of their energy future
 
04:44:00.390 --> 04:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
by using Innovation and Market
 
04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
competition and so I would say keeping
 
04:44:04.670 --> 04:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
the name would be helpful because that
 
04:44:08.708 --> 04:44:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:11.590 --> 04:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
using follow up
 
04:44:14.350 --> 04:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you for that um I think
 
04:44:15.910 --> 04:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
there's other people that may have a
 
04:44:19.230 --> 04:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
slightly different view so would you uh
 
04:44:22.390 --> 04:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
agree then that at the very least that
 
04:44:25.430 --> 04:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill in any amendment that we
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
come forward that we at least to define
 
04:44:31.550 --> 04:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
the two specifically in in there so that
 
04:44:35.430 --> 04:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have this confusion in in the
 
04:44:38.070 --> 04:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
future I would say that defining
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
Community power as the same as Community
 
04:44:42.350 --> 04:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
Choice ever aggregation might be a
 
04:44:45.270 --> 04:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
helpful piece to add but I would want
 
04:44:48.628 --> 04:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
that to be very clear that they are the
 
04:44:50.990 --> 04:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
same thank
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Harrington
 
04:44:56.350 --> 04:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a question thank you
 
04:44:57.550 --> 04:44:57.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:44:59.510 --> 04:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
question actually I got two specific
 
04:45:01.470 --> 04:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
ones I'll have a follow-up coming first
 
04:45:03.190 --> 04:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
one has to do with the discussion we was
 
04:45:04.990 --> 04:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
just held about delinquent accounts
 
04:45:06.590 --> 04:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
there I just want to make sure I get
 
04:45:09.190 --> 04:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
your understanding of this correctly
 
04:45:11.708 --> 04:45:11.718 align:start position:0%
presently the uh if someone doesn't pay
 
04:45:13.190 --> 04:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
their electric bill over an extended
 
04:45:15.948 --> 04:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
period of time eventually the uh that
 
04:45:18.750 --> 04:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
fee is basically allocated to all rate
 
04:45:22.510 --> 04:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
payers uh through the puc uh for the the
 
04:45:25.628 --> 04:45:25.638 align:start position:0%
utility to be made whole and my question
 
04:45:27.788 --> 04:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
is if somebody was in a situation where
 
04:45:29.590 --> 04:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
they were delinquent on their bill and
 
04:45:31.708 --> 04:45:31.718 align:start position:0%
then they became part of a community
 
04:45:34.550 --> 04:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
aggregation would that delinquency come
 
04:45:37.910 --> 04:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
with them and then be I guess eventually
 
04:45:40.070 --> 04:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
spread out to the community aggregation
 
04:45:42.550 --> 04:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
members or would it retain with the
 
04:45:45.190 --> 04:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
utility and they would simply charge all
 
04:45:47.390 --> 04:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
rate payers in the state a little bit to
 
04:45:49.030 --> 04:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
it so that is a level of
 
04:45:58.030 --> 04:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
detail that I am not um I'm not
 
04:46:00.230 --> 04:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about and I apologize for
 
04:46:05.910 --> 04:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
that I um I would I would refer you to
 
04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh Clifton Belo um or Bob Hayden um as
 
04:46:13.270 --> 04:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
two folks who have spoken today that
 
04:46:15.270 --> 04:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
would I believe be able to speak to
 
04:46:16.948 --> 04:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
those that question much better than me
 
04:46:18.868 --> 04:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you uh followup Mr
 
04:46:20.910 --> 04:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
chairman followup it's not really a
 
04:46:22.590 --> 04:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up it's a different subject to
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
some extent what do you how do you
 
04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
envision uh the use of meters I mean
 
04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line we' have to
 
04:46:31.788 --> 04:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
have a revenue grade meter and if that
 
04:46:34.390 --> 04:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
meter was going to also be used to build
 
04:46:36.390 --> 04:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution charges to
 
04:46:39.948 --> 04:46:39.958 align:start position:0%
the utility as well as electric power
 
04:46:42.670 --> 04:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
charges to the Consortium or the
 
04:46:45.708 --> 04:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
community aggregation would you envision
 
04:46:48.910 --> 04:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
two meters or one meter that was owned
 
04:46:51.990 --> 04:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
by who and would it be required to meet
 
04:46:54.270 --> 04:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
the present pu requirements for
 
04:46:56.230 --> 04:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
calibrations and standards that have to
 
04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:01.470 --> 04:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
meters well first of all I would say
 
04:47:05.548 --> 04:47:05.558 align:start position:0%
that um metering and getting new meters
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
would not be something that would happen
 
04:47:13.470 --> 04:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
right away um I believe as you know as
 
04:47:15.670 --> 04:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
other folks have talked about this there
 
04:47:18.070 --> 04:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
is kind of a basic Community power and
 
04:47:20.510 --> 04:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
then there are some some more of these
 
04:47:23.350 --> 04:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
Innovative aspects of it so the basic
 
04:47:25.110 --> 04:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
Community power of aggregating
 
04:47:27.470 --> 04:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
electricity on behalf of all of your
 
04:47:29.830 --> 04:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses is something
 
04:47:32.990 --> 04:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
that does not require a new meter um
 
04:47:38.110 --> 04:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
down the line it could and at that point
 
04:47:39.590 --> 04:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
I think that the market will have
 
04:47:41.948 --> 04:47:41.958 align:start position:0%
changed enough that it I I can't say for
 
04:47:43.788 --> 04:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
sure whether it would make sense to have
 
04:47:47.110 --> 04:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
two meters or replacing the meter that
 
04:47:49.390 --> 04:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
we've got now or having something that
 
04:47:52.110 --> 04:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
you can add to the current meter so I
 
04:47:55.788 --> 04:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
think that there would be a lot of um of
 
04:47:57.590 --> 04:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
unknowns because it wouldn't be
 
04:47:58.990 --> 04:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
something that would be happening right
 
04:48:02.430 --> 04:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
now then follow up again Mr chairman yes
 
04:48:05.110 --> 04:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
follow up okay this will be the last one
 
04:48:07.868 --> 04:48:07.878 align:start position:0%
um it's having to do with the meters the
 
04:48:10.110 --> 04:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
first phase very inquisitive using the
 
04:48:12.110 --> 04:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
meters that are presently installed so
 
04:48:13.628 --> 04:48:13.638 align:start position:0%
would you envision that the utility
 
04:48:15.628 --> 04:48:15.638 align:start position:0%
would continue to read the meter and
 
04:48:18.548 --> 04:48:18.558 align:start position:0%
send out I guess they'd send a bill for
 
04:48:20.190 --> 04:48:20.200 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution to the
 
04:48:22.788 --> 04:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
individual and then send another bill to
 
04:48:25.150 --> 04:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
the Consortium or the or the the the
 
04:48:26.430 --> 04:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
town or whatever is running this
 
04:48:28.350 --> 04:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
aggregation so that they could then in
 
04:48:31.868 --> 04:48:31.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:34.948 --> 04:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
member um I don't know the answer to
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
that one either I could see that in
 
04:48:39.948 --> 04:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
depending upon how this turns out if
 
04:48:44.030 --> 04:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
we're going with 53 RSA 53e I could also
 
04:48:47.190 --> 04:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
see that the community power company
 
04:48:50.390 --> 04:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
could also be reading that meter um but
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
again these are these are um details
 
04:48:54.160 --> 04:48:55.190 align:start position:0%
again these are these are um details
that

04:48:55.190 --> 04:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:58.390 --> 04:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as a as a community
 
04:49:02.510 --> 04:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
organizer and Advocate I am not as up on
 
04:49:06.670 --> 04:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:09.548 --> 04:49:09.558 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you very much uh
 
04:49:12.948 --> 04:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
representative Sage is recognized for a
 
04:49:15.628 --> 04:49:15.638 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:49:18.270 --> 04:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh Miss Henry for taking
 
04:49:22.270 --> 04:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
my question um do you do you see um in
 
04:49:24.708 --> 04:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
light of the fact that most bigger
 
04:49:27.270 --> 04:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
businesses in this state are already
 
04:49:29.628 --> 04:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
aggregating their needs and getting good
 
04:49:32.708 --> 04:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
prices you see the community power act
 
04:49:35.948 --> 04:49:35.958 align:start position:0%
as as as a vehicle allowing more
 
04:49:38.310 --> 04:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
residents and municipalities to do the
 
04:49:40.750 --> 04:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
04:49:42.788 --> 04:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's a that's a very good
 
04:49:45.750 --> 04:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
question and yes it has been a long time
 
04:49:48.470 --> 04:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
coming um as you mentioned that
 
04:49:51.548 --> 04:49:51.558 align:start position:0%
commercial uh entities have had this
 
04:49:54.990 --> 04:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for many many years and you
 
04:49:59.948 --> 04:49:59.958 align:start position:0%
know anybody who has tried to um get
 
04:50:03.190 --> 04:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
third third party supply on their own
 
04:50:05.430 --> 04:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
knows that that is just not what has
 
04:50:08.750 --> 04:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
been available to the average resident
 
04:50:11.548 --> 04:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
and so this this is really the first
 
04:50:15.030 --> 04:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
time because of being able to Leverage
 
04:50:19.070 --> 04:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
The The Whole Town's load um when going
 
04:50:22.070 --> 04:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
out to get energy it's the first time
 
04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
that residents have been able to reap
 
04:50:28.548 --> 04:50:28.558 align:start position:0%
that that benefit followup Mr chair
 
04:50:33.430 --> 04:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
follow up uh and U you we you were
 
04:50:35.470 --> 04:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
discussing a little bit with represent
 
04:50:38.310 --> 04:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
Harrington about the issue of uh
 
04:50:41.030 --> 04:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
individuals who might be def uh
 
04:50:43.750 --> 04:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
defaulting on their payment
 
04:50:46.750 --> 04:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
um uh if I understood correctly the
 
04:50:48.548 --> 04:50:48.558 align:start position:0%
concept that you were
 
04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
describing uh if a municipality actually
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
ends up getting a better rate for
 
04:50:56.708 --> 04:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
everybody in their Town even the person
 
04:51:00.150 --> 04:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
who is uh in default of that bill would
 
04:51:02.628 --> 04:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
actually be defaulting on a lower lower
 
04:51:04.510 --> 04:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
price Bill isn't that
 
04:51:07.390 --> 04:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
correct yes that is correct that is
 
04:51:09.750 --> 04:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
correct and one thing that I didn't
 
04:51:12.628 --> 04:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
mention yeah oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I
 
04:51:14.230 --> 04:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
interrupted so what I'm saying is
 
04:51:15.788 --> 04:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
they're they're being treated actually
 
04:51:17.510 --> 04:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
better than they would be under the
 
04:51:19.070 --> 04:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
regular utility
 
04:51:22.190 --> 04:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
system they very well could be the the
 
04:51:24.190 --> 04:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
other piece that I think is important to
 
04:51:28.390 --> 04:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
know is that with the um the current law
 
04:51:32.110 --> 04:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
it is a requirement that the uh
 
04:51:35.750 --> 04:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
Community power plan has a mechanism for
 
04:51:38.910 --> 04:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
those folks who are on energy assistance
 
04:51:45.150 --> 04:51:45.160 align:start position:0%
to be included into the plan um so and
 
04:51:46.548 --> 04:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
that is something that we feel really
 
04:51:48.990 --> 04:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
strongly about because it it really
 
04:51:52.948 --> 04:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
makes Community power even more of an of
 
04:51:56.350 --> 04:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
a a vehicle for Equitable an equitable
 
04:52:00.070 --> 04:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:03.230 --> 04:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
much thank you seeing no more questions
 
04:52:06.670 --> 04:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
uh I will call on our next presenter who
 
04:52:10.788 --> 04:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
is Victoria paraly miss paraly you have
 
04:52:20.948 --> 04:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:26.030 --> 04:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:29.230 --> 04:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
unmute sorry sorry about that I I didn't
 
04:52:32.310 --> 04:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
realize I actually got on the list um
 
04:52:33.708 --> 04:52:33.718 align:start position:0%
I've just been listening to a lot of
 
04:52:37.788 --> 04:52:37.798 align:start position:0%
what's been said and um I tremendously
 
04:52:40.510 --> 04:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
admire the work uh of those who are
 
04:52:43.390 --> 04:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
speaking against this bill I think the
 
04:52:46.708 --> 04:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
the uh it's been made very clear why it
 
04:52:49.750 --> 04:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
should not have come forward and that it
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
is a complete waste of everyone's time
 
04:52:54.910 --> 04:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
um that's really pretty much what I need
 
04:52:58.390 --> 04:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
to say um and I hope I hope that the
 
04:53:01.350 --> 04:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
committee will itl this Bill thank you
 
04:53:03.070 --> 04:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much we appreciate
 
04:53:06.150 --> 04:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
that next up is
 
04:53:08.628 --> 04:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
um see has not
 
04:53:12.670 --> 04:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:15.310 --> 04:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
two minutes Nick yeah thank you chairman

law Foundation I appreciate the
 
04:53:22.470 --> 04:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to comment on HB
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
315 HB 315 is essentially a solution in
 
04:53:27.590 --> 04:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
search of a problem that would only
 
04:53:29.070 --> 04:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
provide benefits to New Hampshire's
 
04:53:31.270 --> 04:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
utilities at significant cost to New
 
04:53:33.948 --> 04:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's M municipalities and rate

payers SB
 
04:53:38.070 --> 04:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
286 which greatly strengthen the
 
04:53:39.548 --> 04:53:39.558 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of New Hampshire's
 
04:53:41.830 --> 04:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
Community aggregation ation law was
 
04:53:43.590 --> 04:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
signed into a law less than two years
 
04:53:46.510 --> 04:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
ago by Governor senu the current
 
04:53:48.750 --> 04:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
Community power law will work to allow
 
04:53:50.150 --> 04:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
several municipalities to provide
 
04:53:52.868 --> 04:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregation assume local
 
04:53:54.548 --> 04:53:54.558 align:start position:0%
control over their energy resources and
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
services and rest control of the
 
04:53:59.070 --> 04:53:59.080 align:start position:0%
provision of electricity to Monopoly
 
04:54:03.310 --> 04:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
Utilities in contrast proposed HB 315 is
 
04:54:06.350 --> 04:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
an anti-competitive and anti-market Bill
 
04:54:07.830 --> 04:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
that serves no other purpose than to
 
04:54:10.390 --> 04:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
reestablish utilities Monopoly control
 
04:54:14.190 --> 04:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
over Municipal energy markets HP 315
 
04:54:16.230 --> 04:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
would undo the Innovative aims of the
 
04:54:18.868 --> 04:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
current Community power law and would
 
04:54:21.230 --> 04:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
significantly limit Community Choice and
 
04:54:23.868 --> 04:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
local control of energy resources and
 
04:54:27.110 --> 04:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
services which the current law enables
 
04:54:30.948 --> 04:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
HB 315 would also prevent municipalities
 
04:54:34.270 --> 04:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
from prioritizing clean renewable energy
 
04:54:37.230 --> 04:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
generation and other energy resources
 
04:54:38.590 --> 04:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
such as Energy
 
04:54:40.628 --> 04:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
Efficiency would impose reasonable
 
04:54:42.310 --> 04:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
burdens on the ability of municipalities
 
04:54:44.430 --> 04:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
to form Community power
 
04:54:47.628 --> 04:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
aggregators and some because HP 315 is
 
04:54:49.830 --> 04:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
unneeded only benefits New Hampshire's
 
04:54:52.230 --> 04:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
Electric utilities and harms New
 
04:54:54.910 --> 04:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's municipalities and Rays seof
 
04:54:56.708 --> 04:54:56.718 align:start position:0%
urges the committee to reject the bill
 
04:54:59.070 --> 04:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
and vote inexpedient to legislate thank
 
04:55:00.350 --> 04:55:00.360 align:start position:0%

04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my name is Henry
 
04:55:23.868 --> 04:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
hearnden I am an energy professional and
 
04:55:25.150 --> 04:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
I'm working with numerous communities
 
04:55:26.830 --> 04:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
across the state to educate them about
 
04:55:28.868 --> 04:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
the potential of community power and
 
04:55:31.548 --> 04:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
I'll be very brief uh in in my the
 
04:55:33.390 --> 04:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
issues I want to address I'm opposed to
 
04:55:35.390 --> 04:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 315 I think it should be
 
04:55:38.310 --> 04:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
voted itl or retained at the very least
 
04:55:39.910 --> 04:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
I want to call the committee members
 
04:55:42.110 --> 04:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
attention to three aspects of the bill
 
04:55:45.390 --> 04:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
that I think are re reasonable one we've
 
04:55:46.990 --> 04:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
heard about the purchase of receivables
 
04:55:50.990 --> 04:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
and I believe that is new section six um
 
04:55:53.628 --> 04:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
under billing Arrangements uh which
 
04:55:54.910 --> 04:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
which I think is reasonable and agreed
 
04:55:57.470 --> 04:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
to by all parties the second is uh
 
04:55:59.350 --> 04:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
technical detail about new customer
 
04:56:01.070 --> 04:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
enrollments which I believe is in the
 
04:56:05.788 --> 04:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
amendment Roman uh six on page three
 
04:56:08.230 --> 04:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
this refers to uh the manner in which if
 
04:56:10.708 --> 04:56:10.718 align:start position:0%
a new customer hooks up to the grid they
 
04:56:12.830 --> 04:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
would first enroll in the utility power
 
04:56:14.708 --> 04:56:14.718 align:start position:0%
and then periodically the community
 
04:56:16.548 --> 04:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
power program could could ping the
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
utility to enroll them in their um
 
04:56:21.390 --> 04:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
Community power program just a technical
 
04:56:22.830 --> 04:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
fix that I think all the parties agree
 
04:56:24.548 --> 04:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
to so that's the second one is new
 
04:56:27.548 --> 04:56:27.558 align:start position:0%
customer hookups and then um the third
 
04:56:28.948 --> 04:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
thing I'm I'm happy to talk about the
 
04:56:30.470 --> 04:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
metering question if folks have
 
04:56:32.750 --> 04:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
questions on that but I want to be clear
 
04:56:35.030 --> 04:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's some sort of fear mongering and
 
04:56:37.110 --> 04:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
and and hysteria sometimes around the
 
04:56:40.350 --> 04:56:40.360 align:start position:0%
meter issue but there's a clear narrow
 
04:56:43.830 --> 04:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
regulated process in the existing RSA
 
04:56:47.070 --> 04:56:47.080 align:start position:0%
53e that allows for a couple of of ways
 
04:56:49.070 --> 04:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
for a community to implement metters if
 
04:56:51.150 --> 04:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
they would so choose that wouldn't cause
 
04:56:53.868 --> 04:56:53.878 align:start position:0%
cost to shift onto any other customers
 
04:56:55.510 --> 04:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
um and and I can direct you to that
 
04:56:57.470 --> 04:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
portion of the statute and um would be
 
04:56:59.910 --> 04:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
happy to speak more about that um the
 
04:57:01.750 --> 04:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
final thing that I'll that I'll mention
 
04:57:04.070 --> 04:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
here this sort of community power
 
04:57:06.628 --> 04:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
Community aggregation it's all semantics
 
04:57:08.548 --> 04:57:08.558 align:start position:0%
and they're all just referring to this
 
04:57:11.190 --> 04:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
policy in general so I think you know
 
04:57:12.670 --> 04:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's there's misinformation
 
04:57:14.590 --> 04:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
that comes out through these processes I
 
04:57:16.990 --> 04:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
think some some of the parties um you
 
04:57:18.708 --> 04:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
know they're masters of of confusion and
 
04:57:20.708 --> 04:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
misinformation so that they' theyve sort
 
04:57:23.270 --> 04:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
of used that to spread confusion in this
 
04:57:25.310 --> 04:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
particular instance but uh I agree with
 
04:57:27.270 --> 04:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
what Dory dman said about really
 
04:57:29.628 --> 04:57:29.638 align:start position:0%
Community power is relatable you'd call
 
04:57:31.110 --> 04:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
it Peterborough Community power
 
04:57:32.390 --> 04:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
conquered Community power nashv
 
04:57:34.310 --> 04:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
Community power whatever you might have
 
04:57:36.150 --> 04:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
um and we should just put aside the
 
04:57:38.030 --> 04:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
confusion that's been spread around that
 
04:57:39.868 --> 04:57:39.878 align:start position:0%
issue because they all refer to the same
 
04:57:42.390 --> 04:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
thing the final thing I'll mention is I
 
04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
I'd like to participate in any uh
 
04:57:46.990 --> 04:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
processes if there are discussions about
 
04:57:47.990 --> 04:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
how we can move this piece of
 
04:57:50.270 --> 04:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
legislation forward if there is work to
 
04:57:53.070 --> 04:57:53.080 align:start position:0%
uh to to fix it up um and with that I
 
04:57:54.510 --> 04:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions from
 
04:57:55.670 --> 04:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
any of the committee members thank you
 
04:57:57.270 --> 04:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
for your
 
04:58:01.230 --> 04:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
time thank you any questions as
 
04:58:03.150 --> 04:58:03.160 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has recognized for
 
04:58:06.110 --> 04:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chairman thank
 
04:58:08.548 --> 04:58:08.558 align:start position:0%
you for Tak my question again getting
 
04:58:12.510 --> 04:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
back to community power um uh so okay so
 
04:58:14.270 --> 04:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
the community power and aggregation are
 
04:58:17.230 --> 04:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
are the same thing so uh do you think it
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
would be okay then if the communities
 
04:58:23.430 --> 04:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
that you know conf with Community power
 
04:58:25.350 --> 04:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
would it be okay if they would if they
 
04:58:27.150 --> 04:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
would since they would be having the
 
04:58:30.270 --> 04:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
same Services as say any other utility
 
04:58:32.350 --> 04:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
then it would be okay to have the Pu
 
04:58:33.830 --> 04:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
regulate them just like the utilities
 
04:58:36.350 --> 04:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
are since you're provided the same
 
04:58:38.548 --> 04:58:38.558 align:start position:0%
Services I I would disagree with that
 
04:58:40.150 --> 04:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the public utility commit
 
04:58:41.948 --> 04:58:41.958 align:start position:0%
mission is to regulate the natural
 
04:58:44.470 --> 04:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
monopoly of the distribution utility
 
04:58:46.948 --> 04:58:46.958 align:start position:0%
that maintains the distribution grid the
 
04:58:49.110 --> 04:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
low voltage electric distribution grid
 
04:58:51.670 --> 04:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
and not to regulate competitive retail
 
04:58:53.788 --> 04:58:53.798 align:start position:0%
customer services or wholesale power
 
04:58:55.750 --> 04:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
markets which Community power could
 
04:58:59.430 --> 04:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
engage in so um I would I would not say
 
04:59:00.868 --> 04:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
that these programs should be regulated
 
04:59:02.310 --> 04:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
by the Public Utility Commission I think
 
04:59:04.830 --> 04:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
that would be um that would defeat the
 
04:59:06.230 --> 04:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
purpose of
 
04:59:09.230 --> 04:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
innovation follow up yes thank you uh
 
04:59:12.470 --> 04:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
Ken uh oh okay so uh I'm just curious as
 
04:59:14.788 --> 04:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
I don't know how how this exactly would
 
04:59:18.548 --> 04:59:18.558 align:start position:0%
work how do we resolve differences
 
04:59:22.430 --> 04:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
control uh or avoid situations like they
 
04:59:23.670 --> 04:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
had back in the turn of the other
 
04:59:25.788 --> 04:59:25.798 align:start position:0%
century when they had wires everywhere
 
04:59:27.868 --> 04:59:27.878 align:start position:0%
how do we how do we control and regulate
 
04:59:30.868 --> 04:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
that make sure that one one entity
 
04:59:34.230 --> 04:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't become so powerful that they
 
04:59:36.830 --> 04:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
themselves Monopoly I don't understand
 
04:59:39.510 --> 04:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
how that might work I I I think I
 
04:59:41.310 --> 04:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
misunderstood the question and I think I
 
04:59:44.190 --> 04:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
understand it better now um so for
 
04:59:46.708 --> 04:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
particular um issues such as the
 
04:59:49.628 --> 04:59:49.638 align:start position:0%
metering issue um no Community the way
 
04:59:51.430 --> 04:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
the law is written is no Community can
 
04:59:53.270 --> 04:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
Implement meters without going through a
 
04:59:55.270 --> 04:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
Public Utility Commission regulated
 
04:59:57.270 --> 04:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
process that would approve that is in
 
04:59:59.788 --> 04:59:59.798 align:start position:0%
the public good and I would direct your
 
05:00:03.070 --> 05:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
attention to RSA
 
05:00:03.080 --> 05:00:04.708 align:start position:0%
attention to RSA
53e

05:00:04.708 --> 05:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
53e
 
05:00:08.948 --> 05:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
specifically uh section four regulation
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
Roman IV or Roman 4 and what it says
 
05:00:15.030 --> 05:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
there is for the purposes of obtaining
 
05:00:17.430 --> 05:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
interval meta data meter data for load
 
05:00:19.150 --> 05:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
settlement the provision of Energy
 
05:00:21.670 --> 05:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
Services and near realtime customer
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
access to such data a municipal or
 
05:00:25.750 --> 05:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
County aggregator may contri there's
 
05:00:28.310 --> 05:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
three options one may contribute to the
 
05:00:31.030 --> 05:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
cost of the utility provided meter two
 
05:00:33.390 --> 05:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
jointly own a revenue grade meter with
 
05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
the electric utility or three provide
 
05:00:38.030 --> 05:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
its own meter and pay for the cost of
 
05:00:39.470 --> 05:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
that and that would be in addition to
 
05:00:41.548 --> 05:00:41.558 align:start position:0%
the utility meter and the only way you
 
05:00:43.910 --> 05:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
can do any of those three options is if
 
05:00:45.590 --> 05:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
you go through a regulated Public
 
05:00:48.030 --> 05:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
Utility Commission process that the
 
05:00:49.270 --> 05:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
Public Utility Commission approves
 
05:00:51.868 --> 05:00:51.878 align:start position:0%
that's in the public good so there is a
 
05:00:53.868 --> 05:00:53.878 align:start position:0%
very narrowly defined process for the
 
05:00:56.510 --> 05:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
metering issue um I hope that helps to
 
05:01:01.750 --> 05:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:03.990 --> 05:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
question one more thank you okay thank
 
05:01:07.948 --> 05:01:07.958 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you very much so so um so
 
05:01:11.110 --> 05:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
what you just explain this covers not
 
05:01:14.150 --> 05:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
only the initial um you know process to
 
05:01:16.590 --> 05:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
set it up but it would cover for All
 
05:01:19.110 --> 05:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
Time Eternity for all ongoing Services
 
05:01:20.948 --> 05:01:20.958 align:start position:0%
they would come under the same uh
 
05:01:22.708 --> 05:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
regulation is that what you're saying
 
05:01:25.030 --> 05:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
for for every
 
05:01:27.708 --> 05:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
member I I don't know that I understand
 
05:01:29.548 --> 05:01:29.558 align:start position:0%
the question but I don't I don't agree
 
05:01:32.350 --> 05:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
that we should impose strict regulation
 
05:01:34.430 --> 05:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
on competitive markets for services I'm
 
05:01:37.230 --> 05:01:37.240 align:start position:0%
a proponent of of free markets and and
 
05:01:38.910 --> 05:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
Market competition and I believe that
 
05:01:40.788 --> 05:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
the market is left When there's less
 
05:01:42.788 --> 05:01:42.798 align:start position:0%
government sort of meddling and
 
05:01:44.310 --> 05:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
intervention there and and I understand
 
05:01:46.350 --> 05:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
there's a necessity for regulation over
 
05:01:49.390 --> 05:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
the Monopoly utility company as it owns
 
05:01:50.830 --> 05:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
the poles and wires and it makes sense
 
05:01:53.070 --> 05:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
to just have one set of poles and wires
 
05:01:55.470 --> 05:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
and we have to ensure that they are not
 
05:01:59.430 --> 05:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh extracting excessive uh profits from
 
05:02:01.310 --> 05:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
people who are captive to that Monopoly
 
05:02:04.030 --> 05:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
utility but if there are any aspects of
 
05:02:05.830 --> 05:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
the market that we can give to Market
 
05:02:07.390 --> 05:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
competition and really let the the
 
05:02:09.070 --> 05:02:09.080 align:start position:0%
customer choose I think the customer
 
05:02:10.990 --> 05:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
will will know best
 
05:02:14.548 --> 05:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:17.150 --> 05:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
you okay representative McGee has
 
05:02:19.628 --> 05:02:19.638 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you Mr
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr hearnen for
 
05:02:26.910 --> 05:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
your testimony um I I'm looking at uh at
 
05:02:29.628 --> 05:02:29.638 align:start position:0%
53e as really part of the growing pains
 
05:02:32.670 --> 05:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
coming out of our grid modernization and
 
05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
deregulation of the Monopoly utilities
 
05:02:40.990 --> 05:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:42.990 --> 05:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
to to to representative Thomas's
 
05:02:45.750 --> 05:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
question if you could speak to the need
 
05:02:48.948 --> 05:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
for definition of how Community power
 
05:02:50.590 --> 05:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
will actually interact with the
 
05:02:52.670 --> 05:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
utilities because I think that's what
 
05:02:55.230 --> 05:02:55.240 align:start position:0%
people keep grappling with so since you
 
05:02:58.110 --> 05:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
work in that space can you just speak to
 
05:03:00.868 --> 05:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
that portion of it yeah I think it's a
 
05:03:03.590 --> 05:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
great question and I'll I'll just by by
 
05:03:05.390 --> 05:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
way of answering I'll let the committee
 
05:03:08.030 --> 05:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
members know that I conducted Master's
 
05:03:10.430 --> 05:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh thesis research on Public Utility
 
05:03:11.750 --> 05:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
Commission here in New Hampshire and I
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
looked at a number of policies including
 
05:03:15.948 --> 05:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
Grid modernization at the Public Utility
 
05:03:17.430 --> 05:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
Commission that's been ongoing for the
 
05:03:19.868 --> 05:03:19.878 align:start position:0%
past six years and what has become clear
 
05:03:23.350 --> 05:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
is that regulated attempts to modernize
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
our electric grid have failed and have
 
05:03:29.070 --> 05:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
stalled in the regulatory process so we
 
05:03:31.270 --> 05:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
can't rely on sort of top- down state
 
05:03:33.510 --> 05:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
regulation to to give us all these
 
05:03:35.350 --> 05:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
Innovations we know about we know that
 
05:03:37.990 --> 05:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
we could have in terms of time based
 
05:03:39.910 --> 05:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
price signals battery storage
 
05:03:42.788 --> 05:03:42.798 align:start position:0%
integrating Community Resources uh to to
 
05:03:45.150 --> 05:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
lower cost and to lower things like
 
05:03:47.310 --> 05:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
capacity cost and transmission cost and
 
05:03:48.868 --> 05:03:48.878 align:start position:0%
that's where Community power comes in as
 
05:03:51.190 --> 05:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
a vehicle to partner with the utility
 
05:03:53.310 --> 05:03:53.320 align:start position:0%
company to achieve those ends and I
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
think the utility partnership is a key
 
05:03:57.510 --> 05:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
piece we hear about Liberty Utilities
 
05:03:59.110 --> 05:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
they've been a leader they have an
 
05:04:01.708 --> 05:04:01.718 align:start position:0%
Innovative home battery storage pilot
 
05:04:02.830 --> 05:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
program and they're going to work with
 
05:04:04.470 --> 05:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
the city of Lebanon on their Community
 
05:04:06.230 --> 05:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
power program and it really is a
 
05:04:08.070 --> 05:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
partnership we talked about data sharing
 
05:04:10.350 --> 05:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
and we need the utility to share the
 
05:04:12.390 --> 05:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
necessary data with the community power
 
05:04:15.628 --> 05:04:15.638 align:start position:0%
aggregation so that they can um go get
 
05:04:17.190 --> 05:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
pricing and purchase power for their
 
05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
customers and the meter is sort of this
 
05:04:20.990 --> 05:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
shared resource that's collecting that
 
05:04:22.470 --> 05:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
information that's necessary for the
 
05:04:24.788 --> 05:04:24.798 align:start position:0%
utilities business model and that's good
 
05:04:26.430 --> 05:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
but it's also necessary for Community
 
05:04:28.070 --> 05:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
power to be successful and really add
 
05:04:30.430 --> 05:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
values to our community so so this is
 
05:04:32.548 --> 05:04:32.558 align:start position:0%
all a way of saying that Community power
 
05:04:35.548 --> 05:04:35.558 align:start position:0%
is a means to use the market to achieve
 
05:04:37.750 --> 05:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
a modern Energy System as opposed to
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
relying on regulation or Monopoly
 
05:04:42.510 --> 05:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
utility companies that are great for
 
05:04:44.230 --> 05:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
reliability and they do a really great
 
05:04:46.270 --> 05:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
job but they're they're not capable of
 
05:04:50.788 --> 05:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
innovation follow up Mr chair follow up
 
05:04:54.230 --> 05:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
so is that is what you're saying that
 
05:04:56.510 --> 05:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
this is simply a new
 
05:04:58.788 --> 05:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
configuration in term you talked about a
 
05:05:00.750 --> 05:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
partnership between people who are
 
05:05:02.750 --> 05:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
working for local sustainable energy
 
05:05:05.110 --> 05:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
within the communities and the utilities
 
05:05:06.910 --> 05:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
learning how to work learning how to
 
05:05:08.910 --> 05:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
coexist is that what you're saying
 
05:05:10.948 --> 05:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right and I really do
 
05:05:12.230 --> 05:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
believe that there are a lot of
 
05:05:14.190 --> 05:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities for Partnerships take NH
 
05:05:15.990 --> 05:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
saves in the efficiency programs for
 
05:05:17.910 --> 05:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
example the utilities currently
 
05:05:20.190 --> 05:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
administer efficiency programs on behalf
 
05:05:21.948 --> 05:05:21.958 align:start position:0%
of our state and there's an opportunity
 
05:05:23.750 --> 05:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
for Community power to then work with
 
05:05:25.990 --> 05:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
those utility program administrators to
 
05:05:27.390 --> 05:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
make sure the efficiency dollars are
 
05:05:29.030 --> 05:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
getting into their communities in the
 
05:05:31.590 --> 05:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
best ways to low lower costs for
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
individual residents but also for the
 
05:05:35.548 --> 05:05:35.558 align:start position:0%
system as a whole so I think I think the
 
05:05:37.948 --> 05:05:37.958 align:start position:0%
partnership piece is really key here and
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
and it's sort of it's an alter
 
05:05:41.350 --> 05:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
alternative but it's it's the New
 
05:05:42.868 --> 05:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way we've looked around at
 
05:05:45.430 --> 05:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
other states and they have topped down
 
05:05:47.590 --> 05:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
mandated procurements top down
 
05:05:49.868 --> 05:05:49.878 align:start position:0%
regulation and I think there's this
 
05:05:51.910 --> 05:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
really exciting opportunity for New
 
05:05:53.868 --> 05:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to maybe Leap Frog over some
 
05:05:56.030 --> 05:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
of those and take the free market
 
05:05:57.670 --> 05:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
approach take the local control approach
 
05:05:59.430 --> 05:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
and and that's why I'm working so hard
 
05:06:02.830 --> 05:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
on community power thank
 
05:06:05.230 --> 05:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh representative
 
05:06:08.548 --> 05:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
Harrington is recognized for a
 
05:06:10.548 --> 05:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
question muted here thank you Mr
 
05:06:11.670 --> 05:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
05:06:13.110 --> 05:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
question it sounds like you're very
 
05:06:14.510 --> 05:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable on the subject so I'll ask
 
05:06:16.110 --> 05:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
you the question I asked the previous
 
05:06:18.750 --> 05:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
speaker who wasn't able to answer it can
 
05:06:20.628 --> 05:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
you tell us your how you envision
 
05:06:22.350 --> 05:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
metering working here would it be two
 
05:06:24.830 --> 05:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
meters one meter who would own them uh
 
05:06:26.788 --> 05:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
who would read them how would billing be
 
05:06:28.750 --> 05:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
done for transmission and distribution
 
05:06:31.190 --> 05:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
as well as for this bulk power
 
05:06:33.390 --> 05:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
consumption thank you for your question
 
05:06:35.708 --> 05:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
representative uh I would Envision that
 
05:06:38.948 --> 05:06:38.958 align:start position:0%
in initial programs the utility owns the
 
05:06:41.470 --> 05:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
meter and they collect the meter data
 
05:06:43.030 --> 05:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
and in order for the community power
 
05:06:44.830 --> 05:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
program to go and get pricing and to go
 
05:06:46.788 --> 05:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
and know how much electricity it needs
 
05:06:49.030 --> 05:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
to buy they would receive the data from
 
05:06:51.590 --> 05:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
the utility via their electronic data
 
05:06:53.548 --> 05:06:53.558 align:start position:0%
interchange or their service provider or
 
05:06:55.708 --> 05:06:55.718 align:start position:0%
the community power Coalition would
 
05:06:57.788 --> 05:06:57.798 align:start position:0%
receive all of the meter data from the
 
05:06:59.310 --> 05:06:59.320 align:start position:0%
utility this is how competitive
 
05:07:01.470 --> 05:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
suppliers currently work if a supplier
 
05:07:03.350 --> 05:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
wants to sell electricity to any large
 
05:07:05.430 --> 05:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
customer they get the data from the
 
05:07:07.750 --> 05:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
utility company so there's a process by
 
05:07:10.270 --> 05:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
which the utility shares meter data with
 
05:07:12.510 --> 05:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregators down the
 
05:07:15.708 --> 05:07:15.718 align:start position:0%
line there are opportunities for meters
 
05:07:17.270 --> 05:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
that instead of collecting information
 
05:07:19.910 --> 05:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
once monthly meter that collects
 
05:07:22.430 --> 05:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
information during the day to know to to
 
05:07:24.030 --> 05:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
be able to provide some of those those
 
05:07:25.868 --> 05:07:25.878 align:start position:0%
more Innovative Services where you're
 
05:07:27.548 --> 05:07:27.558 align:start position:0%
responding to prices in real time we
 
05:07:30.070 --> 05:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
heard Clifton Belo talk about how they
 
05:07:32.830 --> 05:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
reduce their capacity cost enormously by
 
05:07:34.670 --> 05:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
just responding to the real-time price
 
05:07:36.750 --> 05:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of untapped potential
 
05:07:38.590 --> 05:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
there so down the line it's a question
 
05:07:41.830 --> 05:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
of um will there's one of those three
 
05:07:44.030 --> 05:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
paths will the utility invest in a smart
 
05:07:45.868 --> 05:07:45.878 align:start position:0%
meter and then share smart meter data
 
05:07:48.430 --> 05:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
with the community or will the community
 
05:07:50.150 --> 05:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
invest to their own meter and they'll
 
05:07:52.150 --> 05:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
put that alongside the utilities meter
 
05:07:55.070 --> 05:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
and use that meter I I hope that gets at
 
05:07:56.830 --> 05:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
your question it's a good question and I
 
05:07:59.548 --> 05:07:59.558 align:start position:0%
and I think it's uh will will Merit much
 
05:07:59.558 --> 05:08:00.628 align:start position:0%
and I think it's uh will will Merit much
more

05:08:00.628 --> 05:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:08:03.788 --> 05:08:03.798 align:start position:0%
discussion followup Mr chairman follow
 
05:08:07.110 --> 05:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
up yeah yeah thank you um I you sort of
 
05:08:08.708 --> 05:08:08.718 align:start position:0%
anticipated my next question which was
 
05:08:11.430 --> 05:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
going down the Road of um time of use or
 
05:08:14.310 --> 05:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
realtime monitoring uh it would seem and
 
05:08:15.788 --> 05:08:15.798 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm you're asking for an
 
05:08:17.030 --> 05:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
opinion on this that if we're really
 
05:08:19.390 --> 05:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
going to make use of savings say say
 
05:08:21.868 --> 05:08:21.878 align:start position:0%
typically in say like a residential town
 
05:08:24.548 --> 05:08:24.558 align:start position:0%
where their electric use between the
 
05:08:27.190 --> 05:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
hours of 8 and five is somewhat reduced
 
05:08:28.948 --> 05:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
because everybody's well assuming we get
 
05:08:30.510 --> 05:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
back to normal they're off to work or
 
05:08:33.070 --> 05:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
school or something and a lot of those
 
05:08:34.628 --> 05:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
houses wouldn't be using that much
 
05:08:36.270 --> 05:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
electricity during the peak times
 
05:08:39.510 --> 05:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
especially in the summer um would that
 
05:08:41.390 --> 05:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
with Advanced metering then give them
 
05:08:43.628 --> 05:08:43.638 align:start position:0%
the option of having a a much better
 
05:08:45.788 --> 05:08:45.798 align:start position:0%
profile and subsequently a much better
 
05:08:48.830 --> 05:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
price from A supplier yes you are
 
05:08:50.830 --> 05:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
exactly right representative the purpose
 
05:08:52.350 --> 05:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
of the the advanced metering
 
05:08:55.670 --> 05:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is to harness the load so
 
05:08:58.430 --> 05:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
you can you can you your pricing comes
 
05:09:00.548 --> 05:09:00.558 align:start position:0%
based upon are you using electricity
 
05:09:02.788 --> 05:09:02.798 align:start position:0%
when it's expensive or are you using
 
05:09:04.788 --> 05:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
electricity when it's cheap and once you
 
05:09:06.390 --> 05:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
have a smart meter you can begin to
 
05:09:06.400 --> 05:09:07.230 align:start position:0%
have a smart meter you can begin to
understand

05:09:07.230 --> 05:09:07.240 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:09:09.390 --> 05:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
CommunityWide okay these certain
 
05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
customers they're really driving up our
 
05:09:13.190 --> 05:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
cost because they use electricity at the
 
05:09:15.670 --> 05:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
peak times let's provide a specific
 
05:09:17.230 --> 05:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
service to those customers where we're
 
05:09:18.750 --> 05:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
going to install batteries or Energy
 
05:09:21.190 --> 05:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
Efficiency measures or just ask them to
 
05:09:23.868 --> 05:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
curtail their their energy usage
 
05:09:25.868 --> 05:09:25.878 align:start position:0%
processes and and give them a a discount
 
05:09:27.230 --> 05:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
for that because that will lower the
 
05:09:29.030 --> 05:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
costs for all of us and you can't really
 
05:09:30.868 --> 05:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
do that on a one by one customer by
 
05:09:32.750 --> 05:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
customer but once you have a whole city
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
or a town with a community power program
 
05:09:37.830 --> 05:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
you can really start to look at okay how
 
05:09:40.590 --> 05:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
can we lower people time usage across
 
05:09:42.990 --> 05:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
the entire community and drive down our
 
05:09:44.948 --> 05:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
capacity costs and drive down our
 
05:09:46.830 --> 05:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
transmission costs and maybe there's a
 
05:09:49.830 --> 05:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
way where we could uh construct a new uh
 
05:09:51.948 --> 05:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
solar plus storage facility in the
 
05:09:55.910 --> 05:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
community and use that to do the same
 
05:09:57.948 --> 05:09:57.958 align:start position:0%
thing to to discharge power into the
 
05:10:00.150 --> 05:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
Grid at the time of high cost and lower
 
05:10:01.708 --> 05:10:01.718 align:start position:0%
cost for our community as a whole so I
 
05:10:03.070 --> 05:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
think I think you're exactly right that
 
05:10:04.628 --> 05:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
this is some of the these are some of
 
05:10:07.150 --> 05:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
the complex aspects of community power
 
05:10:09.590 --> 05:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
that um folks who really really like the
 
05:10:11.310 --> 05:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
weeds of the energy industry get really
 
05:10:11.320 --> 05:10:14.430 align:start position:0%
weeds of the energy industry get really
excited

05:10:14.430 --> 05:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:16.670 --> 05:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
about okay thank you representative
 
05:10:20.590 --> 05:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
ssuch is recognized for a question thank
 
05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you uh Mr
 
05:10:26.030 --> 05:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
Hearn for taking my question um so if I
 
05:10:29.110 --> 05:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
understood you correctly um any any type
 
05:10:32.510 --> 05:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
of um structure in a community power
 
05:10:35.670 --> 05:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
entity W would be first would have to
 
05:10:38.070 --> 05:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
first go through some kind of pu process
 
05:10:39.750 --> 05:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
to to
 
05:10:42.548 --> 05:10:42.558 align:start position:0%
ascertain that this is a a verifiable
 
05:10:45.990 --> 05:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
and and sanctioned process is that
 
05:10:48.990 --> 05:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
correct uh no representative the the
 
05:10:50.868 --> 05:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
community power program if they wanted
 
05:10:53.230 --> 05:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
to do metering then they would have to
 
05:10:55.510 --> 05:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
go through a regulated Public Utility
 
05:10:57.470 --> 05:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
Commission process it is my
 
05:10:59.590 --> 05:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
understanding that under the current law
 
05:10:59.600 --> 05:11:00.868 align:start position:0%
understanding that under the current law
RSA

05:11:00.868 --> 05:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
05:11:03.470 --> 05:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
53e there is you're not subjected to
 
05:11:05.270 --> 05:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission regulation
 
05:11:08.310 --> 05:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
this is perhaps a third point that is
 
05:11:10.470 --> 05:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
merits discussion in this and I
 
05:11:11.990 --> 05:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
understand Clifton Bel has done some
 
05:11:13.670 --> 05:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
thinking and some drafting around this
 
05:11:16.390 --> 05:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
but in the original draft of House Bill
 
05:11:20.350 --> 05:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
315 it said every uh city or town would
 
05:11:22.990 --> 05:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
have to go to Public Utility Commission
 
05:11:25.990 --> 05:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
regulation to get approved and a lot of
 
05:11:27.708 --> 05:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
us got scared and we said oh no that
 
05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
could slow things down for years and
 
05:11:31.070 --> 05:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
that would be difficult and and there's
 
05:11:33.548 --> 05:11:33.558 align:start position:0%
a potential compromise there where a
 
05:11:36.868 --> 05:11:36.878 align:start position:0%
city or town could submit its Community
 
05:11:39.708 --> 05:11:39.718 align:start position:0%
power aggregation plan to the Public
 
05:11:41.430 --> 05:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
Utility Commission and the commission
 
05:11:44.190 --> 05:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
would have an opportunity to review it
 
05:11:46.350 --> 05:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
and reject it within a limited time
 
05:11:49.350 --> 05:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
window say 30 days um and provide
 
05:11:51.548 --> 05:11:51.558 align:start position:0%
comment on why that plan failed to meet
 
05:11:53.670 --> 05:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
the statute so there's one potential
 
05:11:56.030 --> 05:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
compromise where there could be a Way
 
05:11:58.110 --> 05:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
Forward where you don't have arduous
 
05:12:00.948 --> 05:12:00.958 align:start position:0%
long drawn out year-long adjudication
 
05:12:02.788 --> 05:12:02.798 align:start position:0%
but maybe just there's a check where the
 
05:12:05.430 --> 05:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
Pu looks at a plan and if they say
 
05:12:07.548 --> 05:12:07.558 align:start position:0%
nothing after 30 days it's approved but
 
05:12:10.470 --> 05:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
they can flag any red flags if they need
 
05:12:13.110 --> 05:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
to uh followup Mr
 
05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up uh and Mr Hen um
 
05:12:20.708 --> 05:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
looking at the original HB
 
05:12:24.230 --> 05:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
315 would you characterize that bill as
 
05:12:27.270 --> 05:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a at least for some utilities as
 
05:12:30.310 --> 05:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
a monopoly protection Bill and an
 
05:12:34.750 --> 05:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:37.110 --> 05:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
power yes uh representative I think that
 
05:12:38.788 --> 05:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
that is accurate I think that I tried it
 
05:12:41.070 --> 05:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
at the in my testimony to highlight
 
05:12:43.750 --> 05:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
three or three of the small areas that I
 
05:12:45.230 --> 05:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
believe are reasonable and that there
 
05:12:47.628 --> 05:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
are reasonable fixes to be made but the
 
05:12:49.150 --> 05:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the bill there are many
 
05:12:51.070 --> 05:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
many changes in the bill repeal and
 
05:12:53.350 --> 05:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
replace strike words all over the place
 
05:12:55.470 --> 05:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
replace language here and there and much
 
05:12:57.670 --> 05:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
of that I don't see the public policy
 
05:12:59.830 --> 05:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
purpose for and the effect of it would
 
05:13:02.390 --> 05:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
be to curtail Market competition and
 
05:13:04.750 --> 05:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
restrict Market competition which is why
 
05:13:10.310 --> 05:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
I'm vinant opposed to the Bill thank you
 
05:13:13.750 --> 05:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you see no more questions for Mr
 
05:13:17.548 --> 05:13:17.558 align:start position:0%
Heen we'll now turn to Cynthia Walter
 
05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
Miss Walter you have the floor for two
 
05:13:25.110 --> 05:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
minutes hello can you hear me you can't
 
05:13:27.990 --> 05:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
we can okay great um yes thank you I'm a
 
05:13:30.110 --> 05:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
DOA resident and I wish to State my
 
05:13:32.990 --> 05:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to House Bill 315 in
 
05:13:35.350 --> 05:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
addition to the testimony I emailed to
 
05:13:37.230 --> 05:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
those of you um on in the committee on
 
05:13:40.670 --> 05:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
February 21 I'm one to 400,000 citizens
 
05:13:43.350 --> 05:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
whose Mayors oppose this bill and I
 
05:13:45.830 --> 05:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
applaud my Mayor Bob carrier and his
 
05:13:49.390 --> 05:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
colleagues this bill creates too many
 
05:13:52.110 --> 05:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
expensive unnecessary restrictions that
 
05:13:54.430 --> 05:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
disadvantage Community power aggregation
 
05:13:57.788 --> 05:13:57.798 align:start position:0%
products projects the 2019 law should go
 
05:14:00.510 --> 05:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
forward any adjustments can be made in
 
05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
adjudicated regulations possibly even
 
05:14:05.150 --> 05:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
including the P that was discussed
 
05:14:07.948 --> 05:14:07.958 align:start position:0%
earlier most of House Bill 315 with
 
05:14:11.430 --> 05:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
amendments um do not protect me instead
 
05:14:13.788 --> 05:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
and they protect the old business model
 
05:14:16.590 --> 05:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
of big energy corporations too much of
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
my money now goes to Big corporations
 
05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
and out of our state also um these
 
05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
corporations have to focus more on
 
05:14:27.708 --> 05:14:27.718 align:start position:0%
profits Than Rap pairs instead I want
 
05:14:29.548 --> 05:14:29.558 align:start position:0%
more of my energy bill to go to
 
05:14:32.430 --> 05:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
Innovative local projects managed by
 
05:14:35.390 --> 05:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
people I know and I don't buy the scare
 
05:14:37.868 --> 05:14:37.878 align:start position:0%
stories from every Source such as meters
 
05:14:40.270 --> 05:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
that mysteriously might not connect
 
05:14:42.948 --> 05:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
instead I know we are smart enough here
 
05:14:44.990 --> 05:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure local projects that use
 
05:14:47.430 --> 05:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
Community power will use compatible
 
05:14:49.030 --> 05:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
equipment and keep our energy
 
05:14:51.708 --> 05:14:51.718 align:start position:0%
distribution consistent local energy
 
05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
wins an efficiency too because big
 
05:14:55.788 --> 05:14:55.798 align:start position:0%
Corporation energy means long
 
05:14:58.430 --> 05:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
transmission lines where up to 90% of
 
05:15:01.110 --> 05:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
the energy is wasted this is a fact of
 
05:15:04.030 --> 05:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
physics diverse energy also makes us
 
05:15:07.270 --> 05:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
more resilient during emergencies more
 
05:15:10.430 --> 05:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
local projects also mean more good local
 
05:15:13.310 --> 05:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
jobs listen to the facts please and
 
05:15:18.430 --> 05:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
Common Sense and drop HB 315 thank
 
05:15:22.590 --> 05:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you we appreciate that any
 
05:15:26.510 --> 05:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss
 
05:15:29.230 --> 05:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
Walter seeing none I will turn to our
 
05:15:32.350 --> 05:15:32.360 align:start position:0%

cleen energy New Hampshire Miss Mano you
 
05:15:39.030 --> 05:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
have the floor for two minutes thank you
 
05:15:40.750 --> 05:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um clean energy New
 
05:15:43.030 --> 05:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire opposes House Bill 315 and
 
05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
asks you to itl this bill we work
 
05:15:47.070 --> 05:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
closely with energy committees and
 
05:15:48.750 --> 05:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities throughout the state and
 
05:15:50.788 --> 05:15:50.798 align:start position:0%
we've seen a lot of enthusiasm for the
 
05:15:52.510 --> 05:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
potential of what community power can
 
05:15:55.110 --> 05:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
offer we've also actively participated
 
05:15:56.750 --> 05:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
in the pre- rulemaking stakeholder
 
05:15:59.590 --> 05:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
process on this issue at the commission
 
05:16:01.310 --> 05:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
some seem to want to draw a distinction
 
05:16:02.590 --> 05:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
between Municipal aggregation and
 
05:16:04.708 --> 05:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
Community power and I want to Echo those
 
05:16:06.590 --> 05:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
that have said before that they are the
 
05:16:09.350 --> 05:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
same thing they're simply different
 
05:16:12.628 --> 05:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
versions of the same thing um eversource
 
05:16:14.470 --> 05:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
wants to refer to Municipal aggregation
 
05:16:17.948 --> 05:16:17.958 align:start position:0%
as the very basic 1.0 version while they
 
05:16:20.430 --> 05:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
seem threatened by the more advanced 2.0
 
05:16:23.070 --> 05:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
or 3.0 version where our communities
 
05:16:24.868 --> 05:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
have more options to evolve their
 
05:16:27.590 --> 05:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
programs House Bill 315 would lock New
 
05:16:30.110 --> 05:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire into the 1.0 or Massachusetts
 
05:16:32.350 --> 05:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
model of Municipal aggregation that's
 
05:16:34.070 --> 05:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
not what our towns and cities want they
 
05:16:37.110 --> 05:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
want to have options opposing HB 315 is
 
05:16:39.190 --> 05:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
about giving customers more choice
 
05:16:41.070 --> 05:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
giving residential customers choice for
 
05:16:43.190 --> 05:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
the first time here in New Hampshire
 
05:16:45.310 --> 05:16:45.320 align:start position:0%
more options is good for customers and
 
05:16:47.230 --> 05:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
more competition is good for
 
05:16:49.788 --> 05:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
markets you asked us to be very specific
 
05:16:51.830 --> 05:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
about what HB 315 would take away that
 
05:16:54.190 --> 05:16:54.200 align:start position:0%
we need and I'll focus on two things we
 
05:16:56.350 --> 05:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
need the ability to contract with local
 
05:16:58.868 --> 05:16:58.878 align:start position:0%
generators therefore ccas should not be
 
05:17:01.548 --> 05:17:01.558 align:start position:0%
forced to only procure power supply from
 
05:17:03.430 --> 05:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
a broker and they must be allowed to be
 
05:17:05.110 --> 05:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
Market participants and manage a
 
05:17:07.470 --> 05:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
portfolio of resources it sounds like
 
05:17:09.150 --> 05:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
your proposed amendments make that
 
05:17:10.708 --> 05:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
slightly better but does not fully
 
05:17:12.190 --> 05:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
address this
 
05:17:15.390 --> 05:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
problem ccas should be allowed to offer
 
05:17:17.430 --> 05:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency demand response
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
battery and Innovative rate structures
 
05:17:22.070 --> 05:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to fully implement the
 
05:17:24.310 --> 05:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
options and innovations that were
 
05:17:27.070 --> 05:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
envisioned for our community power law
 
05:17:29.670 --> 05:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
15 of restructuring is that utility
 
05:17:31.350 --> 05:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
Monopoly be restricted only to
 
05:17:33.548 --> 05:17:33.558 align:start position:0%
electricity delivery or distribution
 
05:17:35.510 --> 05:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for them to hold on to
 
05:17:37.708 --> 05:17:37.718 align:start position:0%
Monopoly beyond that and that is exactly
 
05:17:40.470 --> 05:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
what house bill 315 is attempting to do
 
05:17:40.480 --> 05:17:41.670 align:start position:0%
what house bill 315 is attempting to do
thank

05:17:41.670 --> 05:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:17:50.868 --> 05:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:55.150 --> 05:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
Mano see yes representative McGee is
 
05:17:57.150 --> 05:17:57.160 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you Mr
 
05:17:58.910 --> 05:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Miss Mano for
 
05:18:02.310 --> 05:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
your testimony um are you aware of a
 
05:18:04.310 --> 05:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
citizen petition that was put around I
 
05:18:05.990 --> 05:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
know when we had
 
05:18:08.390 --> 05:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
heard when I know you work with a lot of
 
05:18:10.910 --> 05:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
citizens and when we had heard the bill
 
05:18:14.430 --> 05:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
uh in its initial session I had heard
 
05:18:15.788 --> 05:18:15.798 align:start position:0%
that there was a petition that was being
 
05:18:17.868 --> 05:18:17.878 align:start position:0%
submitted I don't know if it was
 
05:18:19.708 --> 05:18:19.718 align:start position:0%
submitted to the
 
05:18:22.350 --> 05:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
committee um that was not organized by
 
05:18:24.548 --> 05:18:24.558 align:start position:0%
our organization but I am aware that one
 
05:18:27.470 --> 05:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
was circulating um last I'd heard I
 
05:18:29.990 --> 05:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
think there was over 700 signatures on
 
05:18:33.788 --> 05:18:33.798 align:start position:0%
it but um that was not ours so Mr chair
 
05:18:35.788 --> 05:18:35.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if we've received that or
 
05:18:37.628 --> 05:18:37.638 align:start position:0%
if maybe Jen knows about it I I know
 
05:18:39.030 --> 05:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
there were people trying to MIT
 
05:18:40.390 --> 05:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
something and I'm just wondering if that
 
05:18:42.270 --> 05:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
came in as part of
 
05:18:44.590 --> 05:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
testimony I believe it did I got it in
 
05:18:46.750 --> 05:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
my inbox and it was addressed to the
 
05:18:49.830 --> 05:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
house science technology and energy
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
committee okay thank
 
05:18:55.548 --> 05:18:55.558 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative parshall is
 
05:18:57.470 --> 05:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
05:19:00.310 --> 05:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
question yes uh thank you chair and
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh Miss
 
05:19:07.830 --> 05:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
Manel uh I think that the uh what we're
 
05:19:10.230 --> 05:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
talking about the ition wasn't that part
 
05:19:14.110 --> 05:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
of Andrea hodson's uh um testimony that
 
05:19:16.270 --> 05:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
she submitted there was over 711
 
05:19:22.670 --> 05:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:25.070 --> 05:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
believe and I see she still on maybe you
 
05:19:27.270 --> 05:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
could ask her if you really need to know
 
05:19:30.150 --> 05:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
this that's that's not so much of a
 
05:19:33.670 --> 05:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:38.750 --> 05:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
me okay are there any other questions
 
05:19:43.030 --> 05:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none chair now recognizes Peter
 
05:19:46.470 --> 05:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
Hansel uh to speak Mr Hansel you have
 
05:19:46.480 --> 05:19:47.628 align:start position:0%
Hansel uh to speak Mr Hansel you have
two

05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:19:50.788 --> 05:19:50.798 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you for allowing me to
 
05:19:53.390 --> 05:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
speak I I've spoken on some of your
 
05:19:56.150 --> 05:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
earlier hearings and you you probably
 
05:19:58.230 --> 05:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with some of this but I'm the
 
05:20:00.670 --> 05:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
committee I'm the chairman of the city
 
05:20:03.510 --> 05:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
of Kean energy and climate committee and
 
05:20:06.470 --> 05:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
I'm also on the uh Community power
 
05:20:09.270 --> 05:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
committee uh part of the plan you've
 
05:20:11.310 --> 05:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
already heard from uh Elizabeth Dragon
 
05:20:14.910 --> 05:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
our city manager and Bob Hayden who has
 
05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
been hired by our city to uh help us uh
 
05:20:24.030 --> 05:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
put together a community power plan and
 
05:20:27.868 --> 05:20:27.878 align:start position:0%
uh what I'm most concerned about is the
 
05:20:30.470 --> 05:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
the amount of time that this is taking
 
05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
that would delay our process we have uh
 
05:20:36.190 --> 05:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
we have a plan in front of us that we've
 
05:20:39.350 --> 05:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
been working on for uh a while while our
 
05:20:41.910 --> 05:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
our community uh sustain energy
 
05:20:45.390 --> 05:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
sustainability plan has been a two-year
 
05:20:47.750 --> 05:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
process and has been approved by our
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
city council uh unanimously just last
 
05:20:53.708 --> 05:20:53.718 align:start position:0%
month but also along with that is our
 
05:20:56.830 --> 05:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
community power plan which is a key
 
05:20:59.830 --> 05:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
component of the sustainable energy plan
 
05:21:02.628 --> 05:21:02.638 align:start position:0%
and we're we've been uh under the
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
impression that the Pu was going along
 
05:21:08.628 --> 05:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
at a fairly good Pace to approve the
 
05:21:10.310 --> 05:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
regulations that would allow us to put
 
05:21:13.230 --> 05:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
this plan in action uh up until the
 
05:21:16.788 --> 05:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
point when HB 315 was introduced which
 
05:21:20.910 --> 05:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
seemed to uh uh Sidetrack that that
 
05:21:24.310 --> 05:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
progress and uh I I don't want to add
 
05:21:26.350 --> 05:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
much more to my testimony other than
 
05:21:29.590 --> 05:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
what what Bob uh Hayden has said and our
 
05:21:32.110 --> 05:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
city manager that we're all ready to
 
05:21:35.030 --> 05:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
begin uh implementing a plan as soon as
 
05:21:38.590 --> 05:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
the puc is finished and if HB 315 goes
 
05:21:41.190 --> 05:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
through we would have a hard time seeing
 
05:21:44.590 --> 05:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
that uh going forward so I urge you
 
05:21:49.948 --> 05:21:49.958 align:start position:0%
please to uh vote no on HB 315 or or itl
 
05:21:52.750 --> 05:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:56.470 --> 05:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative partial rep
 
05:21:58.670 --> 05:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative Pim Andel rather is that
 
05:22:00.390 --> 05:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
05:22:04.070 --> 05:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
question um thank you Mr chairman uh
 
05:22:08.190 --> 05:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Hamill uh for answering my
 
05:22:08.200 --> 05:22:10.230 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Hamill uh for answering my
question

05:22:10.230 --> 05:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:22:14.628 --> 05:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
is it you you talked about uh everything
 
05:22:17.070 --> 05:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
kind of the breaks going on everything
 
05:22:21.390 --> 05:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
ever since HP 315 was uh
 
05:22:23.670 --> 05:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
introduced uh is there going to be a
 
05:22:27.510 --> 05:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
difference in how things progress if it
 
05:22:31.560 --> 05:22:31.570 align:start position:0%
is ited as opposed to uh
 
05:22:31.570 --> 05:22:34.310 align:start position:0%
is ited as opposed to uh
[Music]

05:22:34.310 --> 05:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:22:36.868 --> 05:22:36.878 align:start position:0%
retained I do not know the answer to
 
05:22:39.230 --> 05:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
that I've heard testimony just through
 
05:22:40.868 --> 05:22:40.878 align:start position:0%
these hearings that there is a Senate
 
05:22:43.150 --> 05:22:43.160 align:start position:0%
bill that covers a lot of the uh
 
05:22:47.390 --> 05:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
concerns that the Pu has I don't know
 
05:22:49.548 --> 05:22:49.558 align:start position:0%
anything about that bill um so I don't
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
know that for how that applies but I
 
05:22:56.110 --> 05:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
think uh Bob Hayden's testimony
 
05:23:00.030 --> 05:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
indicated that if you uh itl this bill
 
05:23:02.070 --> 05:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
or retain it and concentrate on the
 
05:23:03.670 --> 05:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
other bill it would probably resolve
 
05:23:06.548 --> 05:23:06.558 align:start position:0%
some of the remaining issues that the Pu
 
05:23:10.830 --> 05:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:14.628 --> 05:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you no followup no
 
05:23:18.628 --> 05:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
followup okay good thank you I seeing no
 
05:23:18.638 --> 05:23:19.670 align:start position:0%
followup okay good thank you I seeing no
further

05:23:19.670 --> 05:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:23:23.590 --> 05:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
questions and seeing no further hands
 
05:23:27.270 --> 05:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
raised amongst the those in attendance I
 
05:23:31.470 --> 05:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
think we can safely conclude that we can
 
05:23:34.830 --> 05:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
adjourn this public hearing so that is
 
05:23:38.990 --> 05:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
what we shall do at 3:24
 
05:23:42.390 --> 05:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
I thank you all for your for
 
05:23:45.750 --> 05:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
participation for the part two of this
 
05:23:49.948 --> 05:23:49.958 align:start position:0%
uh hearing on HB 315 we had 120 people
 
05:23:52.150 --> 05:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
who signed in in opposition to the bill
 
05:23:56.110 --> 05:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
three who signed in in support of it so
 
05:23:58.750 --> 05:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
we will now take a six minute break
 
05:24:01.788 --> 05:24:01.798 align:start position:0%
until 3:30 at which time we will
 
05:24:05.110 --> 05:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
reconvene and conduct some executive
 
05:24:07.910 --> 05:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
sessions thank you I'll see you in uh

that's

05:26:05.230 --> 05:26:05.240 align:start position:0%

representative McGee thank you Mr
 
05:33:16.350 --> 05:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um isn't this the bill that was
 
05:33:20.390 --> 05:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
asked for by um the consumer Advocate
 
05:33:23.510 --> 05:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
that codified that the adjudicative
 
05:33:25.788 --> 05:33:25.798 align:start position:0%
proceeding was the way that rate setting
 
05:33:27.910 --> 05:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
would be done wasn't it like a I thought
 
05:33:29.150 --> 05:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
it was a simple one I'm wondering why
 
05:33:30.788 --> 05:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
we're iing it I didn't think we were
 
05:33:32.868 --> 05:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
going to can you just tell
 
05:33:36.230 --> 05:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
me yes it that this is the bill you're
 
05:33:39.430 --> 05:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
correct it was requested by the consumer
 
05:33:41.788 --> 05:33:41.798 align:start position:0%
Advocate and unfortunately at the public
 
05:33:43.830 --> 05:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
hearing for the bill only the consumer
 
05:33:45.470 --> 05:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
Advocate testified there was no
 
05:33:48.070 --> 05:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Public Utilities
 
05:33:50.350 --> 05:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
Commission but the Public Utilities
 
05:33:54.030 --> 05:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
Commission reached out to a couple of uh
 
05:33:55.830 --> 05:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
us on the committee
 
05:33:59.948 --> 05:33:59.958 align:start position:0%
afterwards and in uh written letters
 
05:34:03.270 --> 05:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
they indicated that this bill would
 
05:34:07.070 --> 05:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
hamper their ability to conduct their
 
05:34:08.990 --> 05:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
business that they would have to require
 
05:34:13.190 --> 05:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
an uh hire another person in order to do
 
05:34:15.788 --> 05:34:15.798 align:start position:0%
the extra work that would be involved
 
05:34:21.110 --> 05:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
and that it would U require more time
 
05:34:25.470 --> 05:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
to handle all the the matters that they
 
05:34:27.510 --> 05:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
they handle on a day-by-day
 
05:34:30.430 --> 05:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
basis representative Harrington spent
 
05:34:33.430 --> 05:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
more time talking to them that I did and
 
05:34:35.110 --> 05:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
he can tell you more so I'm going to
 
05:34:37.150 --> 05:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Harrington
 
05:34:38.708 --> 05:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
right now thank you thank you Mr
 
05:34:41.070 --> 05:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah I spoke to uh the chair of
 
05:34:43.150 --> 05:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
the Pu a couple of times over the
 
05:34:47.110 --> 05:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
weekend on this and the basic issue is
 
05:34:48.750 --> 05:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
is just as the chairman had stated but
 
05:34:51.110 --> 05:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
also with the new twist that was uh came
 
05:34:53.670 --> 05:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
out after this bill was originally
 
05:34:56.230 --> 05:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
proposed and that's the uh I guess will
 
05:34:58.548 --> 05:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
be hb2 reorganization of the Public
 
05:35:01.670 --> 05:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and really need to
 
05:35:03.910 --> 05:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
see how that shakes out first before we
 
05:35:07.030 --> 05:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
start imposing any new types of edicts
 
05:35:08.910 --> 05:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
on them just think that that's not going
 
05:35:11.590 --> 05:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
to be come to fruition till I don't know
 
05:35:13.070 --> 05:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
I guess sometime in the summer or
 
05:35:14.670 --> 05:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
whatever then we could certainly come
 
05:35:16.510 --> 05:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
back and look at this again for
 
05:35:18.670 --> 05:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
something similar to this or maybe not
 
05:35:20.470 --> 05:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
you know maybe not quite so similar
 
05:35:21.910 --> 05:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
depending on how that reorganization
 
05:35:23.830 --> 05:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
comes out and we can address it at that
 
05:35:25.190 --> 05:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
time that's what they've requested and
 
05:35:27.430 --> 05:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
it seems to make sense to me not in the
 
05:35:29.150 --> 05:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
middle of a reorganization don't try to
 
05:35:30.830 --> 05:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
impose something on there that they
 
05:35:31.788 --> 05:35:31.798 align:start position:0%
think they're going to have trouble
 
05:35:34.548 --> 05:35:34.558 align:start position:0%
working with thank you for the
 
05:35:37.830 --> 05:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
explanation I and I appreciate your your
 
05:35:40.830 --> 05:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
your willingness not to unduly burden
 
05:35:42.670 --> 05:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission but I
 
05:35:44.910 --> 05:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
think what is interesting here is that
 
05:35:46.948 --> 05:35:46.958 align:start position:0%
the language I'm looking at it that it
 
05:35:48.990 --> 05:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
says proceedings of the commission every
 
05:35:50.628 --> 05:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
proceeding conducted by the commission
 
05:35:53.628 --> 05:35:53.638 align:start position:0%
to determine rates and charges of a
 
05:35:53.638 --> 05:35:54.548 align:start position:0%
to determine rates and charges of a
public

05:35:54.548 --> 05:35:54.558 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:35:56.868 --> 05:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
utility so it's not all of their
 
05:35:58.708 --> 05:35:58.718 align:start position:0%
procedures it's the procedures that are
 
05:36:01.990 --> 05:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
considered adjudicative now and so what
 
05:36:04.070 --> 05:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
I heard from the consumer Advocate was
 
05:36:06.030 --> 05:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
that he was the one that surfaced the
 
05:36:09.070 --> 05:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
fact that that there was sort of a
 
05:36:11.590 --> 05:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
sliding or a bending of the rules that
 
05:36:14.430 --> 05:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
they were not
 
05:36:18.390 --> 05:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
um not always adhering to using an
 
05:36:20.350 --> 05:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
adjudicative procedure and they were
 
05:36:22.110 --> 05:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
saying that they might sometimes
 
05:36:23.990 --> 05:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
consider themselves a legislative body
 
05:36:25.230 --> 05:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of making these
 
05:36:27.548 --> 05:36:27.558 align:start position:0%
decisions and skirt the idea of all of
 
05:36:29.628 --> 05:36:29.638 align:start position:0%
the due process that they're required to
 
05:36:32.070 --> 05:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
do so this doesn't say everything they
 
05:36:34.430 --> 05:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
do it doesn't say Ru making or all the
 
05:36:36.470 --> 05:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't list it's very specific it
 
05:36:39.230 --> 05:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
just says to determine rates and charges
 
05:36:41.750 --> 05:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
of Public Utilities so that's why I'm
 
05:36:44.788 --> 05:36:44.798 align:start position:0%
confused because I don't this is what he
 
05:36:45.990 --> 05:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
explained was that it was a
 
05:36:48.430 --> 05:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
clarification of what is in law now but
 
05:36:51.430 --> 05:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
it is more explicit so that there is no
 
05:36:51.440 --> 05:36:52.670 align:start position:0%
it is more explicit so that there is no
ability

05:36:52.670 --> 05:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
ability
 
05:36:55.788 --> 05:36:55.798 align:start position:0%
to skirt the process that was intended I
 
05:36:57.390 --> 05:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
guess by the Public Utilities Commission
 
05:36:59.390 --> 05:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington uh do you
 
05:37:03.390 --> 05:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
remember the specific instances cited in
 
05:37:06.548 --> 05:37:06.558 align:start position:0%
the uh commissioner's letter about the
 
05:37:09.708 --> 05:37:09.718 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that would be impeded um
 
05:37:11.470 --> 05:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
I have to I could pull it up if you just
 
05:37:14.110 --> 05:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
be me for a second please I'll I'll try
 
05:37:16.548 --> 05:37:16.558 align:start position:0%
to get to that someone else wants to
 
05:37:20.070 --> 05:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
speak go ahead yes thank you I was uh
 
05:37:22.470 --> 05:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned by some of the
 
05:37:26.548 --> 05:37:26.558 align:start position:0%
types of activities that indicated would
 
05:37:29.868 --> 05:37:29.878 align:start position:0%
be impeded uh by this legislation I was
 
05:37:31.548 --> 05:37:31.558 align:start position:0%
also kind of somewhat
 
05:37:35.510 --> 05:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
distressed that the consumer Advocate
 
05:37:35.520 --> 05:37:36.430 align:start position:0%
distressed that the consumer Advocate
and

05:37:36.430 --> 05:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:37:40.030 --> 05:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
the chair of the puc couldn't work this
 
05:37:41.868 --> 05:37:41.878 align:start position:0%
out between them I mean they're both
 
05:37:45.070 --> 05:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
lawyers they understand the implications
 
05:37:49.310 --> 05:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
of of the legal issues here I was quite
 
05:37:50.670 --> 05:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
disappointed that they couldn't come up
 
05:37:53.788 --> 05:37:53.798 align:start position:0%
with some kind of a compromised position
 
05:37:56.708 --> 05:37:56.718 align:start position:0%
on this that would allow the committee
 
05:37:59.590 --> 05:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
the commission to do its business in a
 
05:38:02.830 --> 05:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
straightforward way uh while still
 
05:38:05.430 --> 05:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
giving the consumer Advocate the
 
05:38:07.788 --> 05:38:07.798 align:start position:0%
assurance that he would need that the
 
05:38:07.798 --> 05:38:08.868 align:start position:0%
assurance that he would need that the
committee

05:38:08.868 --> 05:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:38:13.310 --> 05:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
is following a judicative legal
 
05:38:15.948 --> 05:38:15.958 align:start position:0%
procedure so
 
05:38:19.350 --> 05:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh I think is is reason enough to itl
 
05:38:22.548 --> 05:38:22.558 align:start position:0%
this bill because um we should ask those
 
05:38:25.868 --> 05:38:25.878 align:start position:0%
two folks to go back to to the table and
 
05:38:27.670 --> 05:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
see if they can come up with some some
 
05:38:31.470 --> 05:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
compromise uh language for legislation
 
05:38:32.670 --> 05:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
of this
 
05:38:35.350 --> 05:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
sort were able to find that letter I'm
 
05:38:37.548 --> 05:38:37.558 align:start position:0%
still looking I was uh because it didn't
 
05:38:40.030 --> 05:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
come directly from Diane it came from l
 
05:38:43.390 --> 05:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
so I have to check it out that way um I
 
05:38:45.350 --> 05:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
think they'd be both open to that I know
 
05:38:47.230 --> 05:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
uh the chair of the Pu said that she was
 
05:38:49.548 --> 05:38:49.558 align:start position:0%
more than willing to sit down and and
 
05:38:51.030 --> 05:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
work out something on this they just
 
05:38:52.590 --> 05:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
didn't have the opportunity to do it at
 
05:38:52.600 --> 05:38:53.390 align:start position:0%
didn't have the opportunity to do it at
this

05:38:53.390 --> 05:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:38:55.990 --> 05:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
time let me see where am I here while
 
05:38:57.990 --> 05:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
you continue to look for that letter I'm
 
05:38:59.948 --> 05:38:59.958 align:start position:0%
gonna recognize Rec representative
 
05:39:03.310 --> 05:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
oxenham for a question or for a
 
05:39:05.190 --> 05:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you very much for
 
05:39:08.910 --> 05:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm really puzzled
 
05:39:11.708 --> 05:39:11.718 align:start position:0%
that there is a discussion going on
 
05:39:14.190 --> 05:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
about letters that have gone to certain
 
05:39:16.670 --> 05:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
members but not other members about
 
05:39:18.948 --> 05:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
testimony that has been provided not in
 
05:39:21.750 --> 05:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
the course of a public hearing I I don't
 
05:39:23.948 --> 05:39:23.958 align:start position:0%
think that this is a proper legislative
 
05:39:27.468 --> 05:39:27.478 align:start position:0%
procedure and I I would request that
 
05:39:29.708 --> 05:39:29.718 align:start position:0%
that this be
 
05:39:32.510 --> 05:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
clarified what's not SL you raise a good
 
05:39:37.590 --> 05:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
point I uh uh will acknowledge that um
 
05:39:39.830 --> 05:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
the Pu did not show up for the public
 
05:39:42.230 --> 05:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
hearing and therefore did not testify
 
05:39:44.868 --> 05:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
right then they did also reach out to
 
05:39:47.868 --> 05:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
both myself and to representative
 
05:39:52.830 --> 05:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
Harrington um privately or non-publicly
 
05:39:55.390 --> 05:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
I guess you could say it um they never
 
05:39:57.150 --> 05:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
told us that we couldn't share any of
 
05:39:59.990 --> 05:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
the information that they shared with us
 
05:40:02.310 --> 05:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh otherwise we wouldn't be talking
 
05:40:03.948 --> 05:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
about that right now
 
05:40:06.350 --> 05:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
but especially if it's influencing the
 
05:40:07.510 --> 05:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
decision of how we're going going to
 
05:40:09.430 --> 05:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
dispose of the bill that's I think the
 
05:40:11.390 --> 05:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
point that that representative oxenham
 
05:40:15.270 --> 05:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
is making yes well uh I agree with her
 
05:40:17.230 --> 05:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm hoping representative
 
05:40:20.270 --> 05:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
Harrington can find the letter that U
 
05:40:20.280 --> 05:40:21.310 align:start position:0%
Harrington can find the letter that U
came

05:40:21.310 --> 05:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
came
 
05:40:25.270 --> 05:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
from the puc commissioner because uh she
 
05:40:28.190 --> 05:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
listed some very specific activities
 
05:40:31.070 --> 05:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
that would be harmed in her judgment by
 
05:40:34.070 --> 05:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation and to me they were
 
05:40:37.430 --> 05:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
persuasive so I'm hoping he can find
 
05:40:39.590 --> 05:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
that and maybe if you can't
 
05:40:42.468 --> 05:40:42.478 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington maybe I can I
 
05:40:46.150 --> 05:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
can look you EXC you think perhaps found
 
05:40:46.160 --> 05:40:46.830 align:start position:0%
can look you EXC you think perhaps found
the

05:40:46.830 --> 05:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:40:49.230 --> 05:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
letter okay representative Harington
 
05:40:50.910 --> 05:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
could you share that with us yes it's
 
05:40:52.510 --> 05:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
pretty short and I can also you know
 
05:40:53.868 --> 05:40:53.878 align:start position:0%
email it to people as well I'll just
 
05:40:56.110 --> 05:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
send it to every all committee members
 
05:40:57.270 --> 05:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
just says the Public Utilities
 
05:41:00.350 --> 05:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
Commission takes no position on HB 371
 
05:41:01.830 --> 05:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
however we offer the following your
 
05:41:03.628 --> 05:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
consideration regarding potential
 
05:41:05.708 --> 05:41:05.718 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and legal effect
 
05:41:07.590 --> 05:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
of the legislation there number of
 
05:41:08.948 --> 05:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
matters that come before the commission
 
05:41:10.350 --> 05:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
that can be resolved in an efficient
 
05:41:12.510 --> 05:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
manner to not generally involve full
 
05:41:14.110 --> 05:41:14.120 align:start position:0%
litigation as this bill would seem to
 
05:41:16.270 --> 05:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
require these include annual adjustments
 
05:41:18.310 --> 05:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
to line extension policies qualified
 
05:41:20.110 --> 05:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
Capital adjustment charges water
 
05:41:22.190 --> 05:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure conservation adjustments
 
05:41:24.070 --> 05:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
and minor tariff changes including those
 
05:41:26.670 --> 05:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
for late fees meter testing rate case
 
05:41:29.070 --> 05:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
expenses and temporary to permanent rate
 
05:41:31.430 --> 05:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
recoups among others it appears that the
 
05:41:33.070 --> 05:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
effect of this legislation would requir
 
05:41:34.350 --> 05:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
these changes be subject to full
 
05:41:37.230 --> 05:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
litigation which would Impact Staff
 
05:41:38.910 --> 05:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
resources potentially require hiring
 
05:41:40.628 --> 05:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
additional staff as well as create
 
05:41:42.190 --> 05:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
additional regulatory leg with the
 
05:41:43.788 --> 05:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
commission which the commission's
 
05:41:45.430 --> 05:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
current flexible procedures are designed
 
05:41:47.750 --> 05:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
to prevent we currently have a pending
 
05:41:49.390 --> 05:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
matter regarding the substance of the
 
05:41:50.910 --> 05:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
bill and are necessarily constrained in
 
05:41:52.990 --> 05:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
our Communications of as a result
 
05:41:55.468 --> 05:41:55.478 align:start position:0%
because that would be expar so that
 
05:41:57.150 --> 05:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
that's it and not it sounds like it's
 
05:41:59.230 --> 05:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
another bill that should be retained it
 
05:42:01.468 --> 05:42:01.478 align:start position:0%
just sounds like these two parties need
 
05:42:04.150 --> 05:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
to have a conversation about what the
 
05:42:06.230 --> 05:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
language needs to be because I think I
 
05:42:08.030 --> 05:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
think the intention of the consumer
 
05:42:10.430 --> 05:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
Advocate was that it'd be very discreet
 
05:42:13.230 --> 05:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
and if there's concerns by the chief
 
05:42:15.948 --> 05:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
commissioner or the I don't know is that
 
05:42:18.868 --> 05:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
what she's called the head commissioner
 
05:42:20.990 --> 05:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
woman yeah that it might spill over into
 
05:42:23.910 --> 05:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
other things and and and be um untenable
 
05:42:25.830 --> 05:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
then I I would imagine that that would
 
05:42:28.190 --> 05:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
be easy to resolve so rather than itl it
 
05:42:32.708 --> 05:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
can't we just retain it and fix it
 
05:42:37.468 --> 05:42:37.478 align:start position:0%
representative here it's disc courteous
 
05:42:40.070 --> 05:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
committee members to speak without being
 
05:42:42.788 --> 05:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
recognized because you deprive them oh
 
05:42:46.310 --> 05:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to speak so if you could just
 
05:42:48.788 --> 05:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
raise your like everybody else I'll be
 
05:42:50.948 --> 05:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
sure to call for recogniz you because I
 
05:42:53.230 --> 05:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
always enjoy what you have to say but I
 
05:42:55.868 --> 05:42:55.878 align:start position:0%
wish you would do it in turn so that
 
05:42:57.060 --> 05:42:57.070 align:start position:0%
other people can
 
05:42:57.070 --> 05:42:58.990 align:start position:0%
other people can
[Music]

05:42:58.990 --> 05:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:43:01.670 --> 05:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
have representative man you're
 
05:43:04.430 --> 05:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
recognized Jo the discussion don't
 
05:43:07.150 --> 05:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
forget to unmute thank you Mr chairman
 
05:43:08.948 --> 05:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just going to support the I
 
05:43:11.430 --> 05:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
the um um um
 
05:43:11.440 --> 05:43:14.070 align:start position:0%
the um um um
retain

05:43:14.070 --> 05:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
retain
 
05:43:16.990 --> 05:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
idea I think it needs I think it needs I
 
05:43:19.190 --> 05:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
think we need to understand it before
 
05:43:21.910 --> 05:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
much better than we do before we um make
 
05:43:23.590 --> 05:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
a decision and I think retain is the
 
05:43:26.110 --> 05:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
only way to do that well itl is another
 
05:43:31.190 --> 05:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
way but uh it looks like it's worth um
 
05:43:38.830 --> 05:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:41.750 --> 05:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my I I want to
 
05:43:44.590 --> 05:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
just uh Echo some of the comments that I
 
05:43:48.948 --> 05:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
think that if if um if members of of the
 
05:43:51.750 --> 05:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh committee leadership receive these
 
05:43:54.350 --> 05:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
kind of letters we probably should get
 
05:43:58.230 --> 05:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
copies of those letters or um emails
 
05:44:00.270 --> 05:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
because what representative Harrington
 
05:44:02.510 --> 05:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
just read sounds like a
 
05:44:05.708 --> 05:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
testimony and normally like you said the
 
05:44:08.468 --> 05:44:08.478 align:start position:0%
Pu was not there testify so we couldn't
 
05:44:11.310 --> 05:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
ask questions so I would just request
 
05:44:12.948 --> 05:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
that if something like this happens in
 
05:44:15.708 --> 05:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
the future that copies of those be made
 
05:44:18.910 --> 05:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
available to the Democratic side as well
 
05:44:21.110 --> 05:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh but I did have a you know I I'm I'm
 
05:44:23.310 --> 05:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
also curious about the fact that and
 
05:44:25.030 --> 05:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
maybe representative Harrington is the
 
05:44:27.310 --> 05:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
best one to answer this since he served
 
05:44:30.868 --> 05:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
on the Pu uh what exactly did the
 
05:44:33.510 --> 05:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate mean when he thought
 
05:44:37.110 --> 05:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
that the Pu in some instances is doing
 
05:44:40.788 --> 05:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
what he called a quasi legislative
 
05:44:45.468 --> 05:44:45.478 align:start position:0%
process and that's where he had some
 
05:44:51.230 --> 05:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:53.468 --> 05:44:53.478 align:start position:0%
Harrington trying to he we okay I think
 
05:44:55.070 --> 05:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
I'm unmuted now I'd have to go back and
 
05:44:56.590 --> 05:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
look at the specifics on that I know it
 
05:44:59.110 --> 05:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
was in a particular ruling that they
 
05:45:03.030 --> 05:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
made uh last uh fall that uh brought the
 
05:45:04.788 --> 05:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
thing up I I just don't have it off the
 
05:45:07.070 --> 05:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
top of my head I I could I could get it
 
05:45:08.628 --> 05:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
someone if you want to find out what it
 
05:45:10.868 --> 05:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
is but it was specific to a particular
 
05:45:12.670 --> 05:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
ruling that came out of the Pu and I'm
 
05:45:14.590 --> 05:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
sure Dawn probably has the information
 
05:45:17.430 --> 05:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
on his fingertips but it wasn't like a
 
05:45:20.110 --> 05:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
general at least I saw it as not being
 
05:45:22.628 --> 05:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
as a general Trend if they were doing
 
05:45:24.230 --> 05:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
something that he did didn't think was
 
05:45:26.430 --> 05:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
proper but it was a specific case
 
05:45:29.150 --> 05:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
involved thank you very much by the way
 
05:45:30.750 --> 05:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington can you send
 
05:45:32.350 --> 05:45:32.360 align:start position:0%
that letter to the members of the
 
05:45:35.390 --> 05:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
committee working on it as we speak okay
 
05:45:37.510 --> 05:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
good thank you representative Bern is
 
05:45:40.270 --> 05:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak thank you Mr
 
05:45:40.280 --> 05:45:41.990 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak thank you Mr
chairman

05:45:41.990 --> 05:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:45:46.230 --> 05:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh um so as I understand
 
05:45:50.030 --> 05:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
hb2 is causing a reorganization of the
 
05:45:52.708 --> 05:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
Pu and and how they're going to conduct
 
05:45:56.070 --> 05:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
some activities we have a conflict here
 
05:45:59.628 --> 05:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
between uh the Pu and
 
05:46:03.468 --> 05:46:03.478 align:start position:0%
uh on how how things need to be done
 
05:46:06.430 --> 05:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
they need to work this out this bill
 
05:46:07.830 --> 05:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
then is
 
05:46:10.310 --> 05:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
really not written the way it needs to
 
05:46:14.510 --> 05:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
be written to resolve that conflict so
 
05:46:17.708 --> 05:46:17.718 align:start position:0%
itl seems like a very reasonable method
 
05:46:20.548 --> 05:46:20.558 align:start position:0%
to address the problem and and they can
 
05:46:23.070 --> 05:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
come back with with some piece of
 
05:46:26.910 --> 05:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
revised legislation go forward once the
 
05:46:29.788 --> 05:46:29.798 align:start position:0%
whole understanding of how the p is
 
05:46:33.150 --> 05:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
going to operate when hb2 is implemented
 
05:46:33.160 --> 05:46:34.628 align:start position:0%
going to operate when hb2 is implemented
it's

05:46:34.628 --> 05:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:46:38.430 --> 05:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
done okay thank you next up is
 
05:46:38.440 --> 05:46:40.070 align:start position:0%
done okay thank you next up is
representative

05:46:40.070 --> 05:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
pintel thank you Mr chairman um this is
 
05:46:47.788 --> 05:46:47.798 align:start position:0%
all really kind of strange to me I mean
 
05:46:51.310 --> 05:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
we had the the original hearing on
 
05:46:54.030 --> 05:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
February 8th and then this
 
05:46:56.350 --> 05:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
weekend uh representative Harrington
 
05:46:58.590 --> 05:46:58.600 align:start position:0%
gets a letter that we don't know about
 
05:47:00.110 --> 05:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
until right
 
05:47:03.070 --> 05:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
now uh which all of a CH sudden is
 
05:47:05.110 --> 05:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
changing what appeared to be and ought
 
05:47:07.430 --> 05:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
to pass to an it
 
05:47:07.440 --> 05:47:09.030 align:start position:0%
to pass to an it
L

05:47:09.030 --> 05:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
L
 
05:47:11.390 --> 05:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh they would have known about this
 
05:47:14.548 --> 05:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
hearing in the first place and and now
 
05:47:18.910 --> 05:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
we're we being asked to itl a bill that
 
05:47:21.708 --> 05:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
essentially uh Mr
 
05:47:24.350 --> 05:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
C um
 
05:47:28.830 --> 05:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
requested and we're giving deference to
 
05:47:33.270 --> 05:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
a letter that was arrive to some people
 
05:47:34.510 --> 05:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
over the
 
05:47:39.190 --> 05:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
weekend and and and iing this bill it
 
05:47:40.750 --> 05:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
seems that if we're going to give
 
05:47:45.430 --> 05:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
difference to the Pu then it should be
 
05:47:50.590 --> 05:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
to uh retain the bill and give both
 
05:47:53.670 --> 05:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
parties uh some breathing room to to
 
05:47:55.510 --> 05:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
work out their
 
05:47:58.468 --> 05:47:58.478 align:start position:0%
differences uh but it Ling it just does
 
05:48:01.830 --> 05:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
sense thank you that's it thank you uh
 
05:48:06.000 --> 05:48:07.310 align:start position:0%
sense thank you that's it thank you uh
representative

05:48:07.310 --> 05:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:48:11.190 --> 05:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
until I would just say that you may re
 
05:48:13.548 --> 05:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
may recall that at that public hearing
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
we had on February 8th I expressed my
 
05:48:19.190 --> 05:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
displeasure and and
 
05:48:22.390 --> 05:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
my dismay at the fact that the Public
 
05:48:24.990 --> 05:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission did not appear to
 
05:48:29.708 --> 05:48:29.718 align:start position:0%
testify on that remember that and uh
 
05:48:35.868 --> 05:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
when they contacted us um after the fact
 
05:48:37.990 --> 05:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
I think they did so because they
 
05:48:43.270 --> 05:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
believed that the issue under
 
05:48:46.468 --> 05:48:46.478 align:start position:0%
discussion was about a docket that was
 
05:48:49.910 --> 05:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
still open at the Pu and they felt that
 
05:48:53.468 --> 05:48:53.478 align:start position:0%
by law they could not discuss the matter
 
05:48:56.070 --> 05:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
at hand because of that open
 
05:49:00.990 --> 05:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
docket and uh the restrictions about ex
 
05:49:04.590 --> 05:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
parte Communications about open dockets
 
05:49:07.350 --> 05:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
so I I sort of understand why they
 
05:49:09.868 --> 05:49:09.878 align:start position:0%
didn't communicate with the full
 
05:49:12.350 --> 05:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
committee about that but at the same
 
05:49:14.788 --> 05:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
time I also understand why they decided
 
05:49:18.030 --> 05:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
to reach out uh and express their
 
05:49:21.708 --> 05:49:21.718 align:start position:0%
concerns in a kind of an unofficial
 
05:49:24.230 --> 05:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
capacity and for my
 
05:49:28.830 --> 05:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
own situation or my own uh feelings
 
05:49:32.110 --> 05:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
about it I didn't rushed to inform the
 
05:49:33.590 --> 05:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee about it because I
 
05:49:37.150 --> 05:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
was unsure about whether this was that
 
05:49:39.948 --> 05:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
could be shared or not so I just want to
 
05:49:44.670 --> 05:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
make that clear to everybody Mr chair um
 
05:49:47.628 --> 05:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
representative PL J is recognized for
 
05:49:52.310 --> 05:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
for a comment I just want to make it uh
 
05:49:55.270 --> 05:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
heard and open that you did not share
 
05:49:58.430 --> 05:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
with anyone else other than Mr Thomas
 
05:50:01.750 --> 05:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
because not only the Democrats the other
 
05:50:03.468 --> 05:50:03.478 align:start position:0%
side did not here this
 
05:50:06.230 --> 05:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
iset was just you and I'm sorry
 
05:50:06.240 --> 05:50:08.350 align:start position:0%
iset was just you and I'm sorry
represent

05:50:08.350 --> 05:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:50:10.948 --> 05:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
Harrington Harrington do you mean
 
05:50:10.958 --> 05:50:12.910 align:start position:0%
Harrington Harrington do you mean
representative

05:50:12.910 --> 05:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:50:15.270 --> 05:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
Harrington yes representative Harrington
 
05:50:17.230 --> 05:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
and I were discussing what to do about
 
05:50:21.070 --> 05:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
this because we weren't entirely sure
 
05:50:24.468 --> 05:50:24.478 align:start position:0%
what the legal situation was um but we
 
05:50:26.510 --> 05:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
decided we had to do something at this
 
05:50:30.990 --> 05:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
point so followup I'm sorry my point was
 
05:50:34.430 --> 05:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
that was just between the chair and
 
05:50:36.788 --> 05:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
representative par
 
05:50:38.190 --> 05:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:50:41.030 --> 05:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
correct well it was between yes the
 
05:50:43.110 --> 05:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
chair and representative farington but
 
05:50:44.788 --> 05:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
now we've made it the entire committee's
 
05:50:44.798 --> 05:50:46.190 align:start position:0%
now we've made it the entire committee's
business

05:50:46.190 --> 05:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
business
 
05:50:49.030 --> 05:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
so uh chair now recognizes
 
05:50:51.390 --> 05:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
representative cran for a
 
05:50:54.510 --> 05:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
comment you Mr chair um I guess I'm a
 
05:50:58.190 --> 05:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
little confused about why the the letter
 
05:51:01.270 --> 05:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
from the Pu would be explicitly
 
05:51:05.150 --> 05:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
on one one case um when this seems to
 
05:51:07.708 --> 05:51:07.718 align:start position:0%
apply to any kinds of cases um and I
 
05:51:09.788 --> 05:51:09.798 align:start position:0%
apologize that I can't speak to the
 
05:51:11.230 --> 05:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
specifics that are in the ladder because
 
05:51:13.750 --> 05:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen it but um from what
 
05:51:16.310 --> 05:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative Harington said it sounded
 
05:51:18.670 --> 05:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
like they were they had some examples of
 
05:51:21.830 --> 05:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
specific cases where they felt like
 
05:51:28.030 --> 05:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
adjusting rates um should follow a less
 
05:51:32.868 --> 05:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
um Less open less judicative uh
 
05:51:35.868 --> 05:51:35.878 align:start position:0%
procedure do you agree with that do we
 
05:51:39.070 --> 05:51:39.080 align:start position:0%
need to put some else in statute to make
 
05:51:41.510 --> 05:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
that clear what Things Fall above and
 
05:51:46.150 --> 05:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
below this line or um sorry I'm not
 
05:51:50.468 --> 05:51:50.478 align:start position:0%
being especially articulate but um it
 
05:51:52.190 --> 05:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
sounds like there maybe is a great area
 
05:51:54.190 --> 05:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
is that something that we should address
 
05:51:56.990 --> 05:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
in legislation to your mind or does
 
05:52:00.548 --> 05:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
anyone else have opinions on that
 
05:52:04.030 --> 05:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
obviously that we should address this
 
05:52:08.070 --> 05:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
legislation request to submit
 
05:52:11.628 --> 05:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
the fact that the BC didn't respond put
 
05:52:13.548 --> 05:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
us in
 
05:52:16.350 --> 05:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
position Mr chair we cannot hear
 
05:52:20.310 --> 05:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
you no I forgot to turn on I forgot to
 
05:52:22.310 --> 05:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
unmute we heard
 
05:52:26.390 --> 05:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
you what I was trying to say is that uh
 
05:52:28.548 --> 05:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
obviously Mr cre thought that this was
 
05:52:31.230 --> 05:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
an important issue but the fact that the
 
05:52:34.708 --> 05:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
Pu didn't respond put us kind of in a in
 
05:52:36.990 --> 05:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
a difficult position
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
because especially after they responded
 
05:52:44.510 --> 05:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
to us kind of off the Record uh here we
 
05:52:46.310 --> 05:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
had this information what are we going
 
05:52:50.510 --> 05:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
to do with it and uh ultimately we
 
05:52:54.230 --> 05:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
decided we had to uh reveal it and
 
05:52:56.430 --> 05:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately we also decided that it
 
05:52:56.440 --> 05:52:57.510 align:start position:0%
ultimately we also decided that it
probably

05:52:57.510 --> 05:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
probably
 
05:53:00.628 --> 05:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
warranted uh sending these two parties
 
05:53:03.468 --> 05:53:03.478 align:start position:0%
back to the drawing board get them to a
 
05:53:05.190 --> 05:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
table talking to each other and one way
 
05:53:07.990 --> 05:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
to do that is to it this bill
 
05:53:10.190 --> 05:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative Cali pittz has recognized
 
05:53:11.390 --> 05:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
for a
 
05:53:13.830 --> 05:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
comment well I want to thank the chair
 
05:53:17.468 --> 05:53:17.478 align:start position:0%
for making this public but I I I think
 
05:53:20.670 --> 05:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
that the lawyers on the commission know
 
05:53:23.510 --> 05:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
better than to try to communicate or
 
05:53:24.788 --> 05:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
Lobby in the
 
05:53:28.628 --> 05:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
background I would say I would not itl
 
05:53:31.990 --> 05:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
this bill I would hold it as a hammer uh
 
05:53:33.750 --> 05:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
and that may sound a little bit harsh
 
05:53:35.310 --> 05:53:35.320 align:start position:0%
but how do you get somebody to go to the
 
05:53:38.468 --> 05:53:38.478 align:start position:0%
table if you don't have something and
 
05:53:41.868 --> 05:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
say look you guys get together and talk
 
05:53:45.590 --> 05:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh and we'll meet again in the fall and
 
05:53:47.270 --> 05:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
this bill will either go forth or you
 
05:53:50.510 --> 05:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
will have settled the problem and I I I
 
05:53:52.510 --> 05:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
think that's what we need to do I I
 
05:53:55.110 --> 05:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
think if we just itl
 
05:53:58.868 --> 05:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
it it's not a very good idea at this
 
05:54:01.830 --> 05:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
point not if we want to see results
 
05:54:01.840 --> 05:54:03.190 align:start position:0%
point not if we want to see results
thank

05:54:03.190 --> 05:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:54:06.708 --> 05:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
you representative is recognized for
 
05:54:09.190 --> 05:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
don't we get the same place by itl it
 
05:54:11.310 --> 05:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
bringing it back next year I'm concerned
 
05:54:13.030 --> 05:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
about the number of bills who've already
 
05:54:16.310 --> 05:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
retained how we can handle so with the
 
05:54:18.468 --> 05:54:18.478 align:start position:0%
itl it doesn't mean it's dead it means
 
05:54:20.788 --> 05:54:20.798 align:start position:0%
it's dead for this session and it comes
 
05:54:22.750 --> 05:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
back next year in some
 
05:54:27.030 --> 05:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
form um my is correct
 
05:54:29.230 --> 05:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
representative in fact that did figure
 
05:54:32.310 --> 05:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
into our decision Mak
 
05:54:32.320 --> 05:54:33.990 align:start position:0%
into our decision Mak
do

05:54:33.990 --> 05:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:54:37.750 --> 05:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
and happen you
 
05:54:40.590 --> 05:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
is offic
 
05:54:44.830 --> 05:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
is man this button uh I do think that's
 
05:54:48.548 --> 05:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
an acceptable solution this Linda get
 
05:54:50.430 --> 05:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
the parties to talk to each other and
 
05:54:52.190 --> 05:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
then bring us back something next year
 
05:54:54.590 --> 05:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
that they can both live with
 
05:54:57.070 --> 05:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington did you have a
 
05:54:59.150 --> 05:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
comment uh no I'm sorry I thought I was
 
05:55:00.708 --> 05:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
on mute I was talking to my
 
05:55:03.350 --> 05:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
wife is
 
05:55:05.948 --> 05:55:05.958 align:start position:0%
still um representative Thomas is
 
05:55:08.350 --> 05:55:08.360 align:start position:0%
recogniz nice for a comment thank you Mr
 
05:55:08.360 --> 05:55:09.990 align:start position:0%
recogniz nice for a comment thank you Mr
chairman

05:55:09.990 --> 05:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:55:13.310 --> 05:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
um with the Pu
 
05:55:16.468 --> 05:55:16.478 align:start position:0%
letter not withstanding that I haven't
 
05:55:20.548 --> 05:55:20.558 align:start position:0%
seen um I I go back to the original
 
05:55:24.510 --> 05:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
testimony of Mr C and it it did sound to
 
05:55:28.468 --> 05:55:28.478 align:start position:0%
me that let me say that for the last
 
05:55:30.510 --> 05:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
four years at
 
05:55:33.788 --> 05:55:33.798 align:start position:0%
least has not had a problem with pu been
 
05:55:36.788 --> 05:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
no issues there been no
 
05:55:39.110 --> 05:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
no no things he thought was was
 
05:55:42.070 --> 05:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
inappropriate in heing but it seemed to
 
05:55:44.350 --> 05:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
me that in in his testimony there was
 
05:55:44.360 --> 05:55:45.548 align:start position:0%
me that in in his testimony there was
one

05:55:45.548 --> 05:55:45.558 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:55:49.110 --> 05:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
case that Disturbed him and he was
 
05:55:51.830 --> 05:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
making his case on that one case I don't
 
05:55:53.390 --> 05:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
believe that we should
 
05:55:57.150 --> 05:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:01.868 --> 05:56:01.878 align:start position:0%
law a oneoff situation so that to me was
 
05:56:03.430 --> 05:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
enough for me to decide that it should
 
05:56:05.948 --> 05:56:05.958 align:start position:0%
be ideal what they wanted to discuss on
 
05:56:09.150 --> 05:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
their own Act is up to them but uh I
 
05:56:13.150 --> 05:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
don't see this as as problem at all so
 
05:56:13.160 --> 05:56:15.310 align:start position:0%
don't see this as as problem at all so
that's

05:56:15.310 --> 05:56:15.320 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:56:18.510 --> 05:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
why representative oxen I'm recognized
 
05:56:19.830 --> 05:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
for a
 
05:56:23.310 --> 05:56:23.320 align:start position:0%
comment thank you very much Mr chair I
 
05:56:26.510 --> 05:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
was going to read um from my notes of of
 
05:56:29.390 --> 05:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
the last meeting I I think it's not at
 
05:56:33.270 --> 05:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
all an issue about one case but but
 
05:56:35.430 --> 05:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
rather than read I it seems to me Mr
 
05:56:36.830 --> 05:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
cis's presid
 
05:56:39.830 --> 05:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
we could ask him whether in fact this
 
05:56:43.190 --> 05:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
comes from one case or whether as he
 
05:56:46.030 --> 05:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
testified this was from his experience
 
05:56:49.590 --> 05:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
both as general counsel of the Pu and as
 
05:56:52.830 --> 05:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
a professor of administrative law that
 
05:56:56.590 --> 05:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
there had been a a sloppiness in
 
05:56:56.600 --> 05:56:58.390 align:start position:0%
there had been a a sloppiness in
procedure

05:56:58.390 --> 05:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
05:57:01.350 --> 05:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
that that adjudicative proceedings which
 
05:57:04.030 --> 05:57:04.040 align:start position:0%
were you know characterized as vanilla
 
05:57:06.990 --> 05:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
and then the this other uh form of
 
05:57:09.788 --> 05:57:09.798 align:start position:0%
proceeding which was chocolate but
 
05:57:13.150 --> 05:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
somehow a a new version of reality was
 
05:57:16.270 --> 05:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
being introduced as a quasi legislative
 
05:57:17.868 --> 05:57:17.878 align:start position:0%
and of course I think for every member
 
05:57:19.628 --> 05:57:19.638 align:start position:0%
present the hairs on the back of our
 
05:57:21.750 --> 05:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
neck stands up when when an agency
 
05:57:24.270 --> 05:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
starts talking about being quasi
 
05:57:26.310 --> 05:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
legislative and I think that was part of
 
05:57:28.948 --> 05:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
the reason that we were all um so so on
 
05:57:31.150 --> 05:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
board but could could we ask Mr CH to
 
05:57:34.868 --> 05:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
explain further I I I I think this is a
 
05:57:37.590 --> 05:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
Salient Point here
 
05:57:40.230 --> 05:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh that's a uh legitimate question
 
05:57:43.350 --> 05:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative oxam but it is my
 
05:57:44.670 --> 05:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that since we're an
 
05:57:48.468 --> 05:57:48.478 align:start position:0%
executive session we cannot ask Mr G
 
05:57:52.548 --> 05:57:52.558 align:start position:0%
question I think we follow up by we
 
05:57:54.510 --> 05:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
certainly have in the past we're not in
 
05:57:56.590 --> 05:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
a work session we're in an executive
 
05:57:59.708 --> 05:57:59.718 align:start position:0%
session and so I believe that that would
 
05:58:03.310 --> 05:58:03.320 align:start position:0%
be a well well excuse me Mr chairman we
 
05:58:06.190 --> 05:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
do not have work sessions anymore so we
 
05:58:08.868 --> 05:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
can't ask anybody to clarify anything
 
05:58:12.510 --> 05:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
anymore if we stick by that Orthodox
 
05:58:16.750 --> 05:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
rule well that is true and if we were
 
05:58:18.948 --> 05:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
living in a normal world I guess we
 
05:58:20.868 --> 05:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
would have work sessions but we're not
 
05:58:23.468 --> 05:58:23.478 align:start position:0%
we're living in a pandemic world so we
 
05:58:26.670 --> 05:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
have to play the hand we're dealt and we
 
05:58:28.030 --> 05:58:28.040 align:start position:0%
just don't have time to have work
 
05:58:31.110 --> 05:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
sessions unfortunately so asking Mr Cree
 
05:58:32.948 --> 05:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
to answer that question seems like a
 
05:58:35.750 --> 05:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
very simple and not very timec consuming
 
05:58:38.230 --> 05:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
thing to do and he's available so I
 
05:58:40.468 --> 05:58:40.478 align:start position:0%
don't see why we're not doing
 
05:58:44.948 --> 05:58:44.958 align:start position:0%
it well I just don't
 
05:58:47.030 --> 05:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
understand whether the rules would
 
05:58:50.070 --> 05:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
permit that I think they
 
05:58:54.390 --> 05:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:58.390 --> 05:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
don't email that we haven't
 
05:59:00.750 --> 05:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
seen now there were three people talking
 
05:59:02.708 --> 05:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't understand any of them
 
05:59:04.270 --> 05:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
hand raised over here representative
 
05:59:06.270 --> 05:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
Cali pittz could you tell us whether you
 
05:59:09.350 --> 05:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
think I believe we can because if the
 
05:59:11.910 --> 05:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
committee agrees we can ask somebody to
 
05:59:14.868 --> 05:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
clarify something and that's not to give
 
05:59:17.670 --> 05:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
a GU a try but to clarify and I and
 
05:59:19.590 --> 05:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's been done before now whether it
 
05:59:21.510 --> 05:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
was legal or not I don't know but it's
 
05:59:25.150 --> 05:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
been done last 20 years that I
 
05:59:30.190 --> 05:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
know okay well why don't we uh recess
 
05:59:32.868 --> 05:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
this executive session then while
 
05:59:35.150 --> 05:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas consults with the
 
05:59:37.670 --> 05:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
clerk to find out if we can ask
 
05:59:41.430 --> 05:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
questions during a exe session and then
 
05:59:44.110 --> 05:59:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh we will reopen this executive session
 
05:59:47.030 --> 05:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
later Mr chair of of point of order who
 
05:59:49.708 --> 05:59:49.718 align:start position:0%
has a point of order representative
 
05:59:53.788 --> 05:59:53.798 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chairman uh I I
 
05:59:57.350 --> 05:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
I'm unclear but if we open up for
 
05:59:59.910 --> 05:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the consumer Advocate to
 
06:00:02.670 --> 06:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
address part of this bill don't we have
 
06:00:06.030 --> 06:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
to then go back to the Pu and say you
 
06:00:08.190 --> 06:00:08.200 align:start position:0%
need to comment and let's get the full
 
06:00:10.948 --> 06:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
story otherwise we'll get half a
 
06:00:13.750 --> 06:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
Lo that's a legitimate concern
 
06:00:13.760 --> 06:00:14.910 align:start position:0%
Lo that's a legitimate concern
legitimate

06:00:14.910 --> 06:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
06:00:14.920 --> 06:00:16.788 align:start position:0%
legitimate
concern

06:00:16.788 --> 06:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
concern
 
06:00:20.190 --> 06:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
so uh so all right so we will recess
 
06:00:27.070 --> 06:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:30.150 --> 06:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman just a question for you
 
06:00:32.310 --> 06:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't couldn't you have the
 
06:00:34.788 --> 06:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
authority that you just recess this
 
06:00:38.310 --> 06:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
session to open up a work session and
 
06:00:40.350 --> 06:00:40.360 align:start position:0%
just for that one purpose and then close
 
06:00:41.590 --> 06:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
the work
 
06:00:43.628 --> 06:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
session then you don't have to ask
 
06:00:46.190 --> 06:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
permission that's a reasonable uh
 
06:00:50.150 --> 06:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
suggestion so let's close the work the
 
06:00:54.110 --> 06:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
executive session on HB 371 and open a
 
06:00:57.310 --> 06:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
work session on HB
 
06:01:00.548 --> 06:01:00.558 align:start position:0%
371 so with this work session was there
 
06:01:04.510 --> 06:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
a question uh representative
 
06:01:06.868 --> 06:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
oxen I forgot
 
06:01:11.750 --> 06:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
yes I the we're asking U Mr C to clarify
 
06:01:14.190 --> 06:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
the issue surrounding the notion of a
 
06:01:18.270 --> 06:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
quasi legislative procedure and whether
 
06:01:23.270 --> 06:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
this was in fact a oneoff issue or
 
06:01:26.628 --> 06:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
not uh Mr Cree could you answer the
 
06:01:29.510 --> 06:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
question was this a oneoff issue or
 
06:01:31.830 --> 06:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
not uh my answer first of all good
 
06:01:33.590 --> 06:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon everybody and thank you for
 
06:01:35.548 --> 06:01:35.558 align:start position:0%
letting me uh say a few things to the
 
06:01:35.558 --> 06:01:36.708 align:start position:0%
letting me uh say a few things to the
committee

06:01:36.708 --> 06:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:01:39.910 --> 06:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh I would not characterize it as a as a
 
06:01:42.948 --> 06:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
oneoff situation the commission has for
 
06:01:47.110 --> 06:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
whatever reason uh asserted a I guess a
 
06:01:50.910 --> 06:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
permanent right to uh make certain rate
 
06:01:52.830 --> 06:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
decisions without conducting an
 
06:01:55.948 --> 06:01:55.958 align:start position:0%
adjudication I I've actually seen the uh
 
06:01:58.350 --> 06:01:58.360 align:start position:0%
communication from the chairwoman to
 
06:02:00.510 --> 06:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
Representatives Harrington and Vose and
 
06:02:02.510 --> 06:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
I agree with them that it would be
 
06:02:04.868 --> 06:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
possible at least for me to address
 
06:02:07.708 --> 06:02:07.718 align:start position:0%
their concerns but my my assumption has
 
06:02:09.948 --> 06:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
always been that if you itl a bill like
 
06:02:11.788 --> 06:02:11.798 align:start position:0%
this then the issue is dead for the
 
06:02:14.468 --> 06:02:14.478 align:start position:0%
banum so I I would prefer to see it
 
06:02:17.190 --> 06:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
retained uh the commission issued an
 
06:02:20.270 --> 06:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
order on Friday that resolved the
 
06:02:22.350 --> 06:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
pending issue that's actually before
 
06:02:25.150 --> 06:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
them in an open docket so the EXP parte
 
06:02:28.390 --> 06:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
problem that led the commission not to
 
06:02:30.150 --> 06:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
appear and I have some sympathy for
 
06:02:32.230 --> 06:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
their sensitivities around that that
 
06:02:34.868 --> 06:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
resolved itself on Friday and that would
 
06:02:36.788 --> 06:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
make it I think more possible for me to
 
06:02:38.990 --> 06:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
have that kind of discussion with uh
 
06:02:41.868 --> 06:02:41.878 align:start position:0%
chairwoman Martin and and as also has
 
06:02:44.788 --> 06:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
been pointed out uh if the provisions
 
06:02:46.990 --> 06:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
about reorganizing the Pu into a
 
06:02:49.910 --> 06:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
department of energy in the uh Budget
 
06:02:52.150 --> 06:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
Trailer Bill actually are adopted that
 
06:02:56.468 --> 06:02:56.478 align:start position:0%
really will um I think um supersede the
 
06:02:58.430 --> 06:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
conversation that we've been having in
 
06:03:01.110 --> 06:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
the HB 371 context but we don't know for
 
06:03:03.590 --> 06:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
sure that that's going to happen hope
 
06:03:05.390 --> 06:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
that was responsive and then some to the
 
06:03:06.788 --> 06:03:06.798 align:start position:0%
question was actually
 
06:03:09.310 --> 06:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
asked okay thank you Mr GRE we
 
06:03:12.070 --> 06:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate that okay
 
06:03:15.150 --> 06:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
so uh representative Chan do you have a
 
06:03:19.110 --> 06:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:23.070 --> 06:03:23.080 align:start position:0%
comment or neither no I am sorry that
 
06:03:27.390 --> 06:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
was from before oh okay thank you okay
 
06:03:30.150 --> 06:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
so we've resolved that question so uh
 
06:03:32.190 --> 06:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
you want to end the work session and go
 
06:03:34.430 --> 06:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
back into executive
 
06:03:37.670 --> 06:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
session see no objections to that uh
 
06:03:40.030 --> 06:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
proposal we'll end the work session on
 
06:03:40.040 --> 06:03:41.150 align:start position:0%
proposal we'll end the work session on
HB

06:03:41.150 --> 06:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
HB
 
06:03:45.750 --> 06:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
371 and resume the exec session on HP
 
06:03:48.390 --> 06:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
371 where there's a motion on the floor
 
06:03:50.310 --> 06:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
by representative Thomas second by
 
06:03:54.350 --> 06:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
representative plet to itl HB 371 is
 
06:03:55.990 --> 06:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
there any further discussion
 
06:03:56.000 --> 06:03:57.548 align:start position:0%
there any further discussion
representative

06:03:57.548 --> 06:03:57.558 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:04:00.750 --> 06:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chair I was going to
 
06:04:02.590 --> 06:04:02.600 align:start position:0%
unmute but I was already unmuted I was
 
06:04:06.948 --> 06:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
just waiting for permission um so I I
 
06:04:08.150 --> 06:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
understand the itail motion is the
 
06:04:10.990 --> 06:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
motion that's pending um but we the new
 
06:04:13.190 --> 06:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
information was to clarify whether or
 
06:04:15.430 --> 06:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
not there was a purpose to retaining the
 
06:04:17.190 --> 06:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
bill and whether there was a benefit to
 
06:04:19.590 --> 06:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
the bill because itl inexpedient to
 
06:04:21.910 --> 06:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
legislate means it's not worth our time
 
06:04:24.910 --> 06:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
so I I understand you want to go to the
 
06:04:26.590 --> 06:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
vote but the vote will then kill the
 
06:04:29.788 --> 06:04:29.798 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm just curious whether we
 
06:04:31.670 --> 06:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
think this can be resolved to everyone's
 
06:04:33.948 --> 06:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
satisfaction so that we can actually
 
06:04:35.390 --> 06:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
address the issue that the bill was
 
06:04:36.670 --> 06:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
present presented to our committee for
 
06:04:39.708 --> 06:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
in the first place rather than just
 
06:04:39.718 --> 06:04:40.590 align:start position:0%
in the first place rather than just
ignore

06:04:40.590 --> 06:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
ignore
 
06:04:42.948 --> 06:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
it I just don't think it's an I just
 
06:04:47.350 --> 06:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:50.750 --> 06:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
um option to be calling for an itl on
 
06:04:50.760 --> 06:04:51.948 align:start position:0%
um option to be calling for an itl on
this

06:04:51.948 --> 06:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:04:56.270 --> 06:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:59.190 --> 06:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
man thank you Mr Speaker I yeah I
 
06:05:01.990 --> 06:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
believe the retain is you know it might
 
06:05:05.150 --> 06:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
be an opportunity for the consumer
 
06:05:08.468 --> 06:05:08.478 align:start position:0%
advocate the Pu to have discussions uh
 
06:05:10.948 --> 06:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
with a with a with a retain hanging over
 
06:05:13.708 --> 06:05:13.718 align:start position:0%
their head they they now really would
 
06:05:16.110 --> 06:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
know that they'd have to they need to
 
06:05:18.548 --> 06:05:18.558 align:start position:0%
resolve that issue and I think that
 
06:05:23.110 --> 06:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
would be um I think that would work well
 
06:05:25.990 --> 06:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
frankly it's just that it just forces
 
06:05:29.270 --> 06:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
them to to come to a table I would
 
06:05:32.070 --> 06:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
think thank you I appreciate the uh
 
06:05:34.190 --> 06:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
motion I don't know if representative
 
06:05:36.468 --> 06:05:36.478 align:start position:0%
Packard would appreciate it
 
06:05:39.070 --> 06:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
um so you're in favor then
 
06:05:42.070 --> 06:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative man of itl no I'm in
 
06:05:44.670 --> 06:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
favor of um U
 
06:05:47.350 --> 06:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
retain strongly in favor of retain
 
06:05:49.350 --> 06:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi is recognized
 
06:05:51.990 --> 06:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
for discussion thank you Mr chairman I
 
06:05:55.030 --> 06:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify the uh consumer
 
06:05:57.670 --> 06:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
Advocate said that if the itail list is
 
06:06:00.430 --> 06:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
dead for the bani I don't believe that's
 
06:06:04.750 --> 06:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
true dead for this half the then it
 
06:06:06.830 --> 06:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
opens up again
 
06:06:09.310 --> 06:06:09.320 align:start position:0%
OPP for
 
06:06:13.190 --> 06:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
next so if the real question is are you
 
06:06:15.750 --> 06:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
going to retain it and with all the
 
06:06:18.590 --> 06:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
other bills that deal with it to fall or
 
06:06:21.030 --> 06:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
are we going to push it to next
 
06:06:25.350 --> 06:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
year well there are what 60 70 house
 
06:06:27.468 --> 06:06:27.478 align:start position:0%
rules so I'm sure you haven't had a
 
06:06:29.590 --> 06:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
chance to learn them all yet but there
 
06:06:32.030 --> 06:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
is a house rule that says if a bill is
 
06:06:34.548 --> 06:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
defeated in the first year of a of the
 
06:06:37.230 --> 06:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
biennium same bill can't be brought back
 
06:06:38.990 --> 06:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
the second
 
06:06:41.110 --> 06:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
year it would have to be a different
 
06:06:41.120 --> 06:06:43.350 align:start position:0%
year it would have to be a different
bill

06:06:43.350 --> 06:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:06:46.030 --> 06:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
so you are incorrect about that but I
 
06:06:47.868 --> 06:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
can understand why you thought maybe
 
06:06:50.868 --> 06:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
that wasn't true but it is a learning
 
06:06:58.150 --> 06:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
process right so U representative uh G
 
06:07:00.670 --> 06:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
now you've already had a chance to well
 
06:07:03.430 --> 06:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
I wanted to just respond to that what
 
06:07:06.468 --> 06:07:06.478 align:start position:0%
was just being said but you asked me to
 
06:07:09.190 --> 06:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
raise my hand if I wanted to
 
06:07:12.468 --> 06:07:12.478 align:start position:0%
comment but uh representative pel hasn't
 
06:07:16.548 --> 06:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
had a chance to speak so okay first uh
 
06:07:17.830 --> 06:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
06:07:22.750 --> 06:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
chairman uh do I got okay I'm off mute
 
06:07:27.708 --> 06:07:27.718 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm hoping that uh that the uh
 
06:07:31.948 --> 06:07:31.958 align:start position:0%
itl motion gets uh withdrawn so that we
 
06:07:34.030 --> 06:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
can make a motion to
 
06:07:35.948 --> 06:07:35.958 align:start position:0%
retain um
 
06:07:40.190 --> 06:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
this isn't uh this isn't a big deal uh
 
06:07:43.510 --> 06:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
to retain this bill this isn't going to
 
06:07:46.468 --> 06:07:46.478 align:start position:0%
bury Us in work uh in the next half of
 
06:07:48.910 --> 06:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
the year it's very simple it's a very
 
06:07:51.270 --> 06:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
simple bill
 
06:07:54.990 --> 06:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
um but it allows them to work together
 
06:07:57.788 --> 06:07:57.798 align:start position:0%
to try and find out their differences
 
06:08:01.948 --> 06:08:01.958 align:start position:0%
and um decide if it really needs
 
06:08:06.390 --> 06:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
changing if in fact as uh Mr CH said
 
06:08:10.150 --> 06:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
this is all about a bill which is uh an
 
06:08:15.468 --> 06:08:15.478 align:start position:0%
issue that has now been resolved then um
 
06:08:18.350 --> 06:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
you know maybe there should be no
 
06:08:22.350 --> 06:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
objection to the bill as written now and
 
06:08:25.628 --> 06:08:25.638 align:start position:0%
if it is something that is still an
 
06:08:28.750 --> 06:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
issue maybe since the issue has been
 
06:08:32.910 --> 06:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
resolved then Mr cre will make a a move
 
06:08:36.030 --> 06:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
to change it more to their liking either
 
06:08:38.150 --> 06:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
way I think we should retain it we
 
06:08:40.628 --> 06:08:40.638 align:start position:0%
shouldn't kill the bill for two
 
06:08:44.230 --> 06:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
years so let's just uh change the motion
 
06:08:47.510 --> 06:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
and retain it and move on okay thank you
 
06:08:51.468 --> 06:08:51.478 align:start position:0%
for that I I would ask the committee to
 
06:08:53.830 --> 06:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
give us or your opinion of what
 
06:08:56.350 --> 06:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill would look like what
 
06:08:58.390 --> 06:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
what would the committee actually
 
06:09:02.150 --> 06:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
do none of us are lawyers uh what would
 
06:09:08.510 --> 06:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:10.548 --> 06:09:10.558 align:start position:0%
well can we
 
06:09:10.558 --> 06:09:12.230 align:start position:0%
well can we
speak

06:09:12.230 --> 06:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
speak
 
06:09:15.110 --> 06:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
I if we retain it we don't really even
 
06:09:17.708 --> 06:09:17.718 align:start position:0%
have to do anything we can do something
 
06:09:19.190 --> 06:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
but we don't have
 
06:09:22.030 --> 06:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
to it will either come back to us in the
 
06:09:25.230 --> 06:09:25.240 align:start position:0%
same form in the fall in which case we
 
06:09:28.310 --> 06:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
can have another hearing and they show
 
06:09:31.948 --> 06:09:31.958 align:start position:0%
up for the exact same bill or the two of
 
06:09:35.110 --> 06:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
them will work together to change the
 
06:09:35.120 --> 06:09:36.708 align:start position:0%
them will work together to change the
bill

06:09:36.708 --> 06:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:09:39.670 --> 06:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
or we could do a subcommittee to try and
 
06:09:41.548 --> 06:09:41.558 align:start position:0%
work this out but we don't have to do
 
06:09:44.150 --> 06:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
that we can just let it come back just
 
06:09:46.868 --> 06:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
the way it is without doing
 
06:09:49.190 --> 06:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
anything hey to explain the process when
 
06:09:50.788 --> 06:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
you retain a bill the bill itself
 
06:09:50.798 --> 06:09:51.830 align:start position:0%
you retain a bill the bill itself
doesn't

06:09:51.830 --> 06:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
06:09:55.868 --> 06:09:55.878 align:start position:0%
change right all you do
 
06:09:59.468 --> 06:09:59.478 align:start position:0%
is delay making a decision on it to give
 
06:10:01.070 --> 06:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
you time to think about whether you want
 
06:10:04.350 --> 06:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
to change it so it would be up to us to
 
06:10:06.230 --> 06:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
change the bill
 
06:10:08.390 --> 06:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
if we decide that's what we want to do
 
06:10:11.430 --> 06:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
the other option would be to six months
 
06:10:15.468 --> 06:10:15.478 align:start position:0%
from now just decide to itail it then or
 
06:10:17.230 --> 06:10:17.240 align:start position:0%
pass it then those would be the other
 
06:10:17.240 --> 06:10:18.548 align:start position:0%
pass it then those would be the other
two

06:10:18.548 --> 06:10:18.558 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:10:22.030 --> 06:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
options so I'm trying to get a sense
 
06:10:24.910 --> 06:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
what the committee would like to do if
 
06:10:26.948 --> 06:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
they retain this particular
 
06:10:29.270 --> 06:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
Bill representative
 
06:10:33.510 --> 06:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
ssuch uh yes thank you Mr chairman I I I
 
06:10:35.830 --> 06:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
just like to make a motion to
 
06:10:37.830 --> 06:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
to retain this
 
06:10:40.270 --> 06:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
bill we already have a motion pending on
 
06:10:44.110 --> 06:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
the floor so that's that's out sorry all
 
06:10:47.350 --> 06:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
right representative McGee thank you I I
 
06:10:49.510 --> 06:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify some things that
 
06:10:49.520 --> 06:10:51.030 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify some things that
I'm

06:10:51.030 --> 06:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
06:10:55.070 --> 06:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
hearing if we itl the bill then the idea
 
06:10:57.468 --> 06:10:57.478 align:start position:0%
is off the table and whether or not it
 
06:11:01.468 --> 06:11:01.478 align:start position:0%
had Merit we'll never know um I believe
 
06:11:04.750 --> 06:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
that what uh consumer Advocate Cree had
 
06:11:07.468 --> 06:11:07.478 align:start position:0%
said was that that there was a a
 
06:11:09.190 --> 06:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
proceeding going on at the
 
06:11:12.310 --> 06:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
Pu that prohibited him from having this
 
06:11:14.070 --> 06:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
conversation with the commissioner at
 
06:11:16.310 --> 06:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
the time that that was resolved I guess
 
06:11:19.548 --> 06:11:19.558 align:start position:0%
last week so now they can discuss it so
 
06:11:21.628 --> 06:11:21.638 align:start position:0%
if there is something that the
 
06:11:23.628 --> 06:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
commission has a problem with in the
 
06:11:25.910 --> 06:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
bill I think it could probably be
 
06:11:29.390 --> 06:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
resolved fairly easily but the idea of
 
06:11:31.830 --> 06:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
an inexpedient to legislate designation
 
06:11:33.670 --> 06:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
on a bill means that it isn't worth
 
06:11:35.910 --> 06:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
anybody's time and there's nothing there
 
06:11:37.350 --> 06:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
and that's why you try to kill it for
 
06:11:40.910 --> 06:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
two years so I don't think this meets
 
06:11:44.110 --> 06:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
that qualification I think that the EXP
 
06:11:47.628 --> 06:11:47.638 align:start position:0%
parte communication with our committee
 
06:11:52.070 --> 06:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
um was interesting um you know I but I
 
06:11:54.310 --> 06:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
don't think we should respond to an
 
06:11:57.628 --> 06:11:57.638 align:start position:0%
expart letter and let that govern the
 
06:12:00.150 --> 06:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
disposition of the bill as if the
 
06:12:02.030 --> 06:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
original presentation that was made to
 
06:12:05.670 --> 06:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
us that there was a problem um
 
06:12:08.030 --> 06:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
had no merit so I I feel like we're
 
06:12:10.628 --> 06:12:10.638 align:start position:0%
making that decision by saying it's it's
 
06:12:14.750 --> 06:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
not worth anybody else's time and so I
 
06:12:17.750 --> 06:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
really disagree with the idea of just
 
06:12:19.750 --> 06:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
getting it off our plate it it doesn't
 
06:12:21.670 --> 06:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
seem like if these two parties who are
 
06:12:23.390 --> 06:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
now able to talk to each other about the
 
06:12:26.230 --> 06:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
issue can give us the answer that we
 
06:12:28.788 --> 06:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
couldn't retain it and dispose of it
 
06:12:31.628 --> 06:12:31.638 align:start position:0%
properly without a lot of work to to
 
06:12:32.948 --> 06:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
somebody else's point that they already
 
06:12:35.468 --> 06:12:35.478 align:start position:0%
made representative MC Williams is
 
06:12:37.948 --> 06:12:37.958 align:start position:0%
recognized for
 
06:12:41.150 --> 06:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
com um two things first I want to set
 
06:12:44.590 --> 06:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
the record straight I'm a lawyer uh
 
06:12:47.430 --> 06:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
second um I think it's important that we
 
06:12:51.628 --> 06:12:51.638 align:start position:0%
do work with um both sides so if we
 
06:12:54.390 --> 06:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
retain the bill we could ask for comment
 
06:12:57.110 --> 06:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
or Amendment suggestions from both sides
 
06:12:58.990 --> 06:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
so that's my two
 
06:13:02.270 --> 06:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
cents my apologies for not remembering
 
06:13:03.628 --> 06:13:03.638 align:start position:0%
that you were a
 
06:13:06.190 --> 06:13:06.200 align:start position:0%
liyar uh representative Thomas has
 
06:13:09.110 --> 06:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
recognized for comments thank you Mr uh
 
06:13:12.270 --> 06:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
first i i i u I disagree with
 
06:13:15.750 --> 06:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative assessment uh itl does
 
06:13:18.270 --> 06:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
not necessarily mean that a bill is not
 
06:13:20.670 --> 06:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
worth one's time it can mean many
 
06:13:23.750 --> 06:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
reasons one uh and I've seen it happen
 
06:13:27.990 --> 06:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
often where it's not a bad idea like the
 
06:13:32.230 --> 06:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
bill but it needs so much work that uh
 
06:13:33.670 --> 06:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
really needs to go back to the Joint
 
06:13:36.070 --> 06:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
board and come up with some different
 
06:13:38.030 --> 06:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
approaches and that's why it would be
 
06:13:40.830 --> 06:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
itl another reason would be for obvious
 
06:13:43.910 --> 06:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
reasons um the majority would feel it's
 
06:13:47.830 --> 06:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
just a outright bad idea and they don't
 
06:13:50.190 --> 06:13:50.200 align:start position:0%
think it should be pass law so there's
 
06:13:53.390 --> 06:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
several reasons why one will itail this
 
06:13:56.150 --> 06:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
bill other is might be legislature might
 
06:13:57.750 --> 06:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
feel like you know they should not be
 
06:14:00.468 --> 06:14:00.478 align:start position:0%
getting involved in this type of a law
 
06:14:03.830 --> 06:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
should be worked out by some of method
 
06:14:07.110 --> 06:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
which in the leads stronger to what I
 
06:14:10.510 --> 06:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill is like and also
 
06:14:13.270 --> 06:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
if we do ideal this bill and I I do not
 
06:14:17.548 --> 06:14:17.558 align:start position:0%
intend to withdraw my my motion or ideel
 
06:14:22.590 --> 06:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
uh if this is IDE then a bill can come
 
06:14:26.948 --> 06:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
back next year if it is written in a a
 
06:14:29.750 --> 06:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
different approach with a different
 
06:14:33.708 --> 06:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
enough idea trying to get at the same
 
06:14:36.670 --> 06:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
thing but it has different language and
 
06:14:38.670 --> 06:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
maybe even has a potential solution in
 
06:14:41.070 --> 06:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
this one if it's different enough and
 
06:14:43.868 --> 06:14:43.878 align:start position:0%
the speaker allows it then it the bill
 
06:14:46.590 --> 06:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
would be introduced and so it doesn't
 
06:14:50.030 --> 06:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
mean that it's dead for next2 years but
 
06:14:52.110 --> 06:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
I think this is the
 
06:14:56.110 --> 06:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
case and if the two parties can work out
 
06:14:57.468 --> 06:14:57.478 align:start position:0%
the differences and if they want to
 
06:14:59.628 --> 06:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
codify it they can come back with
 
06:15:01.390 --> 06:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
another bill which certainly would be
 
06:15:05.230 --> 06:15:05.240 align:start position:0%
different than one that's now
 
06:15:07.110 --> 06:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
that's a good point uh representative
 
06:15:09.070 --> 06:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
Thomas representative partial you
 
06:15:12.270 --> 06:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
recognized for a comment yes thank you
 
06:15:14.788 --> 06:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
chairman um let me understand one thing
 
06:15:16.708 --> 06:15:16.718 align:start position:0%
you said earlier may I ask a question
 
06:15:19.390 --> 06:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
you said we could uh retain it and the
 
06:15:22.628 --> 06:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
fall come back and either itl it then we
 
06:15:25.110 --> 06:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
can also accept amendments to it as well
 
06:15:27.468 --> 06:15:27.478 align:start position:0%
in the fall can we
 
06:15:30.390 --> 06:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
not yes and I indicated that that was
 
06:15:32.590 --> 06:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
another possibility okay forgive me I
 
06:15:36.390 --> 06:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
guess I missed that segment of it um
 
06:15:38.990 --> 06:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
I you said you wanted our um us to weigh
 
06:15:41.670 --> 06:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
in I would weigh in to retain it that's
 
06:15:43.190 --> 06:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to come back next year
 
06:15:45.670 --> 06:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
and deal with it again it doesn't sound
 
06:15:49.510 --> 06:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
like it's a very time consumptive uh
 
06:15:51.830 --> 06:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
bill from our perspective as long as we
 
06:15:54.708 --> 06:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
can get them to the table however I will
 
06:15:57.510 --> 06:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
list in deference to whatever the uh
 
06:15:59.628 --> 06:15:59.638 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill recommends I would
 
06:16:01.750 --> 06:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
like to hear what he has to say about it
 
06:16:05.030 --> 06:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:05.040 --> 06:16:06.030 align:start position:0%
 
thank

06:16:06.030 --> 06:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:16:09.468 --> 06:16:09.478 align:start position:0%
you doesn't sound like it be a time but
 
06:16:14.948 --> 06:16:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:17.070 --> 06:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
minutes I
 
06:16:20.270 --> 06:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
think ra my hand here sorry oh
 
06:16:23.230 --> 06:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
representative recognize for comment yes
 
06:16:25.788 --> 06:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
thank you um just in response to what
 
06:16:27.868 --> 06:16:27.878 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas had said that if
 
06:16:31.270 --> 06:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
we choose to itl this bill and then it
 
06:16:32.868 --> 06:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
needs to come back next year it would
 
06:16:34.310 --> 06:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
have to be in substantially different
 
06:16:37.030 --> 06:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
form I guess I'm not convinced that as
 
06:16:39.350 --> 06:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
written is not the best way of
 
06:16:42.270 --> 06:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
addressing the issue that we think is
 
06:16:46.270 --> 06:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
here um or maybe here uh so for that
 
06:16:47.910 --> 06:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
reason I would be in favor of retaining
 
06:16:50.230 --> 06:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
it rather than iing it to leave this
 
06:16:52.510 --> 06:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
solution potentially on the table if we
 
06:16:57.270 --> 06:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:59.468 --> 06:16:59.478 align:start position:0%
needed representative Harrington's
 
06:17:01.350 --> 06:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
06:17:04.030 --> 06:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
comment um I think we're kind of killing
 
06:17:07.230 --> 06:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
this over over doing this uh I would uh
 
06:17:10.708 --> 06:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
I could go either retaining it or it
 
06:17:12.548 --> 06:17:12.558 align:start position:0%
Ling it because it's probably going to
 
06:17:15.150 --> 06:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
be some change to it necessary due to
 
06:17:18.150 --> 06:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
the reorg in the Pu there's certainly a
 
06:17:20.910 --> 06:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
a good enough chance of that but uh I
 
06:17:22.788 --> 06:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
also think we've probably spent enough
 
06:17:24.510 --> 06:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
time on it now we should do something
 
06:17:27.788 --> 06:17:27.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:31.948 --> 06:17:31.958 align:start position:0%
other okay seeing no further uh hands
 
06:17:33.990 --> 06:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
raised and no further discussion on this
 
06:17:37.350 --> 06:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
issue I'm going to ask the clerk to call

I'm a uh co-sponsor on this bill this
 
06:19:39.708 --> 06:19:39.718 align:start position:0%
was one that was retained last year um
 
06:19:41.590 --> 06:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
and it was brought forward and we all
 
06:19:44.868 --> 06:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
felt that it had Merit and we asked the
 
06:19:46.990 --> 06:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
original sponsors to work on the bill
 
06:19:48.990 --> 06:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
and bring it back at the beginning of
 
06:19:51.468 --> 06:19:51.478 align:start position:0%
the session however when the bill saw
 
06:19:53.708 --> 06:19:53.718 align:start position:0%
the light of day we discovered that
 
06:19:57.030 --> 06:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
there had been no changes so I agree and
 
06:20:00.990 --> 06:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
support the notion of itl this is uh we
 
06:20:03.150 --> 06:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
we we we were in support of a change and
 
06:20:05.868 --> 06:20:05.878 align:start position:0%
what we got was no change therefore we
 
06:20:08.030 --> 06:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
should not support
 
06:20:10.830 --> 06:20:10.840 align:start position:0%

06:23:29.070 --> 06:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
recognized the last bill we saw Meritt
 
06:23:31.510 --> 06:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
in and asked for
 
06:23:33.910 --> 06:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
changes we didn't get those changes so
 
06:23:37.590 --> 06:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
we it yiled it this bill is the bill
 
06:23:40.230 --> 06:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
that has the changes that we
 
06:23:43.788 --> 06:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
requested I'm flabbergasted that
 
06:23:43.798 --> 06:23:45.310 align:start position:0%
requested I'm flabbergasted that
we're

06:23:45.310 --> 06:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
we're
 
06:23:47.830 --> 06:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
moving forward with the the notion of
 
06:23:51.990 --> 06:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:55.830 --> 06:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
from do we have any explanation for that
 
06:23:58.390 --> 06:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
motion uh representative white did you
 
06:24:07.868 --> 06:24:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:10.030 --> 06:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
this you don't have to if you don't want
 
06:24:15.270 --> 06:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:18.990 --> 06:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
comment okay representative
 
06:24:24.468 --> 06:24:24.478 align:start position:0%
bee yes thank you Mr chairman um I'm
 
06:24:26.948 --> 06:24:26.958 align:start position:0%
very surprised with an itl motion and no
 
06:24:30.390 --> 06:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
explanation of why an itl motion um I
 
06:24:33.190 --> 06:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
thought this Bill had the support from
 
06:24:34.830 --> 06:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
the governor when
 
06:24:37.390 --> 06:24:37.400 align:start position:0%
representative Lang moved forward with
 
06:24:41.430 --> 06:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
it which is why I was a co-sponsor on it
 
06:24:43.830 --> 06:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
um because there was
 
06:24:47.430 --> 06:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
a significant need for some relief in
 
06:24:51.708 --> 06:24:51.718 align:start position:0%
terms of Municipal net metering and um
 
06:24:54.110 --> 06:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
and this was the response to that outcry
 
06:24:56.750 --> 06:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
and it was also supported last time
 
06:24:59.750 --> 06:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
around when it was um hb12 62 from the
 
06:25:02.910 --> 06:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
governor's office so I I'm just kind of
 
06:25:05.350 --> 06:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
shocked that we're thinking this is not
 
06:25:08.230 --> 06:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
needed when uh all the testimony was to
 
06:25:10.750 --> 06:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
the contrary so I I'm just trying to
 
06:25:12.750 --> 06:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
figure out where this comes from why why
 
06:25:15.468 --> 06:25:15.478 align:start position:0%
would we kill this bill after this is
 
06:25:17.510 --> 06:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
the third well it's more than the third
 
06:25:20.430 --> 06:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
year I think but it's at least three
 
06:25:23.990 --> 06:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
years in the making um so there's not
 
06:25:30.510 --> 06:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:33.510 --> 06:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
gonna we have no other vehicle so is is
 
06:25:36.070 --> 06:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
there is it no explanation for why were
 
06:25:37.310 --> 06:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is being
 
06:25:41.310 --> 06:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
killed actually there is um those of you
 
06:25:45.110 --> 06:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
who were around last year may recall
 
06:25:49.910 --> 06:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
that at the time uh the original bill I
 
06:25:51.190 --> 06:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
think it was
 
06:25:56.230 --> 06:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
1262 was introduced by representative
 
06:25:59.750 --> 06:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
Cal there was expressed concern by a
 
06:26:01.350 --> 06:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
couple of people who
 
06:26:04.430 --> 06:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
testified that
 
06:26:06.150 --> 06:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
would open up
 
06:26:11.070 --> 06:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
a wild west market for the sale of
 
06:26:13.628 --> 06:26:13.638 align:start position:0%
electricity and that there would be no
 
06:26:18.270 --> 06:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
protections for consumers who engaged in
 
06:26:21.868 --> 06:26:21.878 align:start position:0%
the purchase of electricity from um
 
06:26:24.670 --> 06:26:24.680 align:start position:0%
another fellow
 
06:26:27.430 --> 06:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
Citizen and the concern was
 
06:26:30.110 --> 06:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
that this Market would be would be
 
06:26:32.628 --> 06:26:32.638 align:start position:0%
subject to fraud it would be subject to
 
06:26:35.270 --> 06:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
lawsuits it would be
 
06:26:38.948 --> 06:26:38.958 align:start position:0%
uh a good concept that would probably
 
06:26:40.350 --> 06:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
eventually lead
 
06:26:44.548 --> 06:26:44.558 align:start position:0%
to abuse and it was suggested at the
 
06:26:46.468 --> 06:26:46.478 align:start position:0%
time that if the bill was ever brought
 
06:26:48.788 --> 06:26:48.798 align:start position:0%
back that there would be language added
 
06:26:51.948 --> 06:26:51.958 align:start position:0%
to it that would provide some kind of
 
06:26:54.190 --> 06:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
consumer protection for people who
 
06:26:58.150 --> 06:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
engaged in these um in these
 
06:27:01.310 --> 06:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
transactions between essentially between
 
06:27:07.110 --> 06:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
private citizens um to me that makes
 
06:27:10.548 --> 06:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
this bill extremely difficult to
 
06:27:14.230 --> 06:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
consider passing and u i was hopeful
 
06:27:17.150 --> 06:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
that when we saw it again there would be
 
06:27:17.160 --> 06:27:18.548 align:start position:0%
that when we saw it again there would be
more

06:27:18.548 --> 06:27:18.558 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:27:21.788 --> 06:27:21.798 align:start position:0%
language introduced that would provide
 
06:27:23.670 --> 06:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
some protection for people who want to
 
06:27:28.310 --> 06:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
do these uh these kinds of one-on-one
 
06:27:28.320 --> 06:27:29.468 align:start position:0%
do these uh these kinds of one-on-one
person-to-person

06:27:29.468 --> 06:27:29.478 align:start position:0%
person-to-person
 
06:27:31.468 --> 06:27:31.478 align:start position:0%
transactions but I didn't see that in
 
06:27:35.150 --> 06:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and uh so that was the concern
 
06:27:38.190 --> 06:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
that I had and I know there are other
 
06:27:40.270 --> 06:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
people who have other concerns about the
 
06:27:43.390 --> 06:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
bill yeah that's interesting I've been
 
06:27:45.150 --> 06:27:45.160 align:start position:0%
working on the bill for a while I've
 
06:27:46.948 --> 06:27:46.958 align:start position:0%
never heard that explanation I've never
 
06:27:49.310 --> 06:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
heard that concern before um limited
 
06:27:51.070 --> 06:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
electric energy producers would be
 
06:27:54.708 --> 06:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
regulated they would not be able to be a
 
06:27:56.750 --> 06:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
wild wild west the way that you're
 
06:28:00.628 --> 06:28:00.638 align:start position:0%
characterizing it um I I'm just really
 
06:28:03.070 --> 06:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
surprised that none of this came up in
 
06:28:04.910 --> 06:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
the hearing none of these conversations
 
06:28:08.270 --> 06:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
none of these characterizations of what
 
06:28:09.868 --> 06:28:09.878 align:start position:0%
it could
 
06:28:12.510 --> 06:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
do um so you don't remember the
 
06:28:14.990 --> 06:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
conversations from last year I remember
 
06:28:16.948 --> 06:28:16.958 align:start position:0%
the conversations around double dipping
 
06:28:20.708 --> 06:28:20.718 align:start position:0%
and people being able to uh participate
 
06:28:23.070 --> 06:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
in multiple types of markets or have net
 
06:28:25.390 --> 06:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
metering as well as being able to sell
 
06:28:28.150 --> 06:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
and they didn't want people who were
 
06:28:31.110 --> 06:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
qualified as under the Lepa The Limited
 
06:28:34.350 --> 06:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
electric energy producer act uh to be
 
06:28:35.910 --> 06:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
able to participate in those other
 
06:28:38.788 --> 06:28:38.798 align:start position:0%
markets or they wanted the definition of
 
06:28:40.948 --> 06:28:40.958 align:start position:0%
what someone was if they were a leap
 
06:28:44.590 --> 06:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
person uh to be kind of confined and
 
06:28:46.948 --> 06:28:46.958 align:start position:0%
restricted but this idea that they would
 
06:28:48.788 --> 06:28:48.798 align:start position:0%
they could commit fraud because of how
 
06:28:51.270 --> 06:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
they were selling and all that I I I I I
 
06:28:55.310 --> 06:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
don't I don't understand how how you're
 
06:28:58.310 --> 06:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
getting there to to say that that that
 
06:28:59.990 --> 06:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
could happen with this bill that they
 
06:29:01.628 --> 06:29:01.638 align:start position:0%
that there wouldn't be any regulation of
 
06:29:04.150 --> 06:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
people who are selling okay thank you
 
06:29:04.160 --> 06:29:05.830 align:start position:0%
people who are selling okay thank you
representative

06:29:05.830 --> 06:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:29:09.708 --> 06:29:09.718 align:start position:0%
pel thank you Mr chairman uh when we had
 
06:29:12.750 --> 06:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
the hearings none of the things that you
 
06:29:15.150 --> 06:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
talked about came
 
06:29:18.750 --> 06:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
up um you mentioned that they were
 
06:29:21.590 --> 06:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
talked about in last year's Bill well
 
06:29:25.070 --> 06:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
this is essentially an amended version
 
06:29:29.390 --> 06:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
of last year's bill um I mean the
 
06:29:32.910 --> 06:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
comments that we heard at the um at the
 
06:29:36.030 --> 06:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
hearings were very fa favorable and once
 
06:29:40.030 --> 06:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
again we're being asked to itl a bill
 
06:29:45.468 --> 06:29:45.478 align:start position:0%
based on stuff that was not available to
 
06:29:48.270 --> 06:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
at the hearing we did not have an
 
06:29:51.110 --> 06:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ask questions on these
 
06:29:56.070 --> 06:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
things it just seems um like once again
 
06:29:56.080 --> 06:29:56.948 align:start position:0%
things it just seems um like once again
we're

06:29:56.948 --> 06:29:56.958 align:start position:0%
we're
 
06:30:01.910 --> 06:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
being uh as to itl a bill which to me
 
06:30:04.948 --> 06:30:04.958 align:start position:0%
looks like a pretty good bill
 
06:30:04.958 --> 06:30:07.788 align:start position:0%
looks like a pretty good bill
thank

06:30:07.788 --> 06:30:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:12.310 --> 06:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:15.548 --> 06:30:15.558 align:start position:0%
crean thank you um just adding to this
 
06:30:18.868 --> 06:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
that all the information that I had all
 
06:30:20.708 --> 06:30:20.718 align:start position:0%
emails that I received on this bill
 
06:30:22.628 --> 06:30:22.638 align:start position:0%
we're all in support of the bill so I
 
06:30:24.230 --> 06:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
can't really in good conscience vote to
 
06:30:24.240 --> 06:30:27.948 align:start position:0%
can't really in good conscience vote to
itl

06:30:27.948 --> 06:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:34.230 --> 06:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:37.310 --> 06:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um yeah I too
 
06:30:39.670 --> 06:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
have received lots of Communications on
 
06:30:42.590 --> 06:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
this bill and they're all favorable and
 
06:30:44.670 --> 06:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
if you remember the blue sheet sign up
 
06:30:50.468 --> 06:30:50.478 align:start position:0%
was 164 for it one person against it
 
06:30:55.590 --> 06:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a PR loc control Bill
 
06:30:58.468 --> 06:30:58.478 align:start position:0%
and this is also a bill that gives local
 
06:31:00.030 --> 06:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities we're talking
 
06:31:02.990 --> 06:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities now not individuals the
 
06:31:06.628 --> 06:31:06.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to make use of instate
 
06:31:08.910 --> 06:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
Hydro power that they have in their
 
06:31:11.788 --> 06:31:11.798 align:start position:0%
communities and and towns uh to the
 
06:31:15.510 --> 06:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
maximum ability uh as a renewable energy
 
06:31:18.350 --> 06:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
source I don't know why we would be
 
06:31:22.110 --> 06:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
disparaging our own instate energy
 
06:31:24.990 --> 06:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
resources uh and not supporting them so
 
06:31:28.628 --> 06:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:31.110 --> 06:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
idea uh representative
 
06:31:34.628 --> 06:31:34.638 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair uh seem to
 
06:31:36.868 --> 06:31:36.878 align:start position:0%
recall there was some issue about a
 
06:31:38.788 --> 06:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
06:31:44.240 --> 06:31:44.250 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:44.250 --> 06:31:46.628 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:31:46.628 --> 06:31:46.638 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:31:49.070 --> 06:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
needed I think the bill contains a
 
06:31:49.080 --> 06:31:49.948 align:start position:0%
needed I think the bill contains a
property

06:31:49.948 --> 06:31:49.958 align:start position:0%
property
 
06:31:55.788 --> 06:31:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:58.590 --> 06:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
the for for the
 
06:32:01.628 --> 06:32:01.638 align:start position:0%
actual right right that's right now we
 
06:32:05.510 --> 06:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
call the the the local utility or
 
06:32:08.750 --> 06:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
whoever that would be gets a property
 
06:32:11.708 --> 06:32:11.718 align:start position:0%
tax exemption on this bill as well where
 
06:32:14.430 --> 06:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
the other utility does not and we've had
 
06:32:16.750 --> 06:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
many issues before about towns
 
06:32:19.750 --> 06:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
collecting property taxes from utilities
 
06:32:22.628 --> 06:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
and so this seems to me that it would be
 
06:32:27.230 --> 06:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
rather unfair and also would Rob to of
 
06:32:30.708 --> 06:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
tax doll so the bill does a work and I
 
06:32:32.750 --> 06:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
think it's just too too much to go on
 
06:32:35.430 --> 06:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
here so that's another reason why I
 
06:32:37.990 --> 06:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
was really having trouble understanding
 
06:32:39.788 --> 06:32:39.798 align:start position:0%
what Doug's saying uh something to do
 
06:32:44.510 --> 06:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:47.270 --> 06:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
mumbled his microphone isn't real close
 
06:32:50.788 --> 06:32:50.798 align:start position:0%
here here's another one I don't have a
 
06:32:53.548 --> 06:32:53.558 align:start position:0%
micone uh what I said was that this bill
 
06:32:56.270 --> 06:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
contains an exemption for property taxes
 
06:32:58.670 --> 06:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
on any entity that would be supplying
 
06:33:00.750 --> 06:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
power uh which you know they function
 
06:33:03.110 --> 06:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
like a small utility so being exempt
 
06:33:06.270 --> 06:33:06.280 align:start position:0%
from a U ility property tax again would
 
06:33:08.270 --> 06:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
be unfair to the other utilities and
 
06:33:10.788 --> 06:33:10.798 align:start position:0%
also the fact that we rob Talent of tax
 
06:33:12.388 --> 06:33:12.398 align:start position:0%
dollars and we've had many bills on this
 
06:33:13.948 --> 06:33:13.958 align:start position:0%
before in the past involving property
 
06:33:15.548 --> 06:33:15.558 align:start position:0%
taxes on utilities how much are they
 
06:33:17.868 --> 06:33:17.878 align:start position:0%
assess and so forth and so this bill has
 
06:33:19.990 --> 06:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
problems along those lines as well uh
 
06:33:21.590 --> 06:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that is a subject that would be way
 
06:33:23.548 --> 06:33:23.558 align:start position:0%
too difficult to fix on this bill as
 
06:33:26.750 --> 06:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
well so that's why I also support itl
 
06:33:30.310 --> 06:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
for that reason is may I may I speak to
 
06:33:32.430 --> 06:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
that chairman Bose because that's not
 
06:33:32.440 --> 06:33:34.270 align:start position:0%
that chairman Bose because that's not
accurate

06:33:34.270 --> 06:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
06:33:37.190 --> 06:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
the language that's added to the statute
 
06:33:40.628 --> 06:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
is do it when it's your
 
06:33:43.310 --> 06:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
turn representative oxam is in the queue
 
06:33:46.670 --> 06:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
ahead of ahead of you representative
 
06:33:50.270 --> 06:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
oxam thank thank you Mr chair um Tom
 
06:33:54.030 --> 06:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
France of the Pu actually uh was present
 
06:33:56.350 --> 06:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
at the hearing and and was asked
 
06:33:59.990 --> 06:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
questions uh by the chair and according
 
06:34:03.070 --> 06:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
to my notes he was um happy with the
 
06:34:06.670 --> 06:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
bill he you know did the suggestion that
 
06:34:08.948 --> 06:34:08.958 align:start position:0%
there's an issue of a possibility of
 
06:34:12.628 --> 06:34:12.638 align:start position:0%
fraud or lawsuits or this leading to
 
06:34:16.788 --> 06:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
abuse none of that was raised by the Pu
 
06:34:19.670 --> 06:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
in fact they felt that the um that this
 
06:34:21.310 --> 06:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
bill addressed the points that have been
 
06:34:25.430 --> 06:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
raised last year so I'm again I'm I'm
 
06:34:28.548 --> 06:34:28.558 align:start position:0%
really flabbergasted by the notion of of
 
06:34:29.990 --> 06:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
proceeding to an
 
06:34:34.070 --> 06:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
itl thank you okay now representative
 
06:34:36.190 --> 06:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
your turn thank you Mr chair and excuse
 
06:34:40.070 --> 06:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
me for before um when um representative
 
06:34:42.230 --> 06:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
Thomas mentioned the exemption that came
 
06:34:44.548 --> 06:34:44.558 align:start position:0%
at the end I did the explanation I have
 
06:34:47.830 --> 06:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
my written testimony and that section at
 
06:34:51.788 --> 06:34:51.798 align:start position:0%
the end that is relative to um the
 
06:34:55.910 --> 06:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
utility prop property tax exclusion def
 
06:34:58.548 --> 06:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
definition all that is doing is adding
 
06:35:00.590 --> 06:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
language to
 
06:35:03.708 --> 06:35:03.718 align:start position:0%
accommodate this new producer with in
 
06:35:07.350 --> 06:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
the list of of other non utilities that
 
06:35:10.510 --> 06:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
are producing and adds the word storage
 
06:35:12.948 --> 06:35:12.958 align:start position:0%
because it is not represented in the
 
06:35:16.430 --> 06:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
language yet so it's definitional only
 
06:35:18.548 --> 06:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
and that exemption would go to these
 
06:35:21.430 --> 06:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
producers because they're not utilities
 
06:35:23.788 --> 06:35:23.798 align:start position:0%
um they're they're they're generators or
 
06:35:25.388 --> 06:35:25.398 align:start position:0%
storage but they're not utilities so
 
06:35:28.910 --> 06:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
they're totally entitled to it um no one
 
06:35:31.310 --> 06:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
had any testimony to the contrary so I
 
06:35:34.190 --> 06:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clear that that item up
 
06:35:36.110 --> 06:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
and the other language above in the bill
 
06:35:38.708 --> 06:35:38.718 align:start position:0%
from 2 three four five all those
 
06:35:42.548 --> 06:35:42.558 align:start position:0%
sections talk about how this category of
 
06:35:45.910 --> 06:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
producer will be treated um through the
 
06:35:47.910 --> 06:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission so there
 
06:35:49.788 --> 06:35:49.798 align:start position:0%
it's not a wild west I mean the same
 
06:35:51.670 --> 06:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
process they're just a different type of
 
06:35:53.548 --> 06:35:53.558 align:start position:0%
generator and that's all we were trying
 
06:35:56.310 --> 06:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
to do was add that language to the
 
06:36:00.350 --> 06:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
statute in in conjunction with all of
 
06:36:01.708 --> 06:36:01.718 align:start position:0%
the efforts that were made in the prior
 
06:36:03.670 --> 06:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
two years to get this bill to the point
 
06:36:06.430 --> 06:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
it was adequate statutorily adequate
 
06:36:08.670 --> 06:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
language which is what it is
 
06:36:11.070 --> 06:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi is recognized
 
06:36:14.670 --> 06:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so as I look at
 
06:36:17.670 --> 06:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
that specific language uh that you are
 
06:36:21.230 --> 06:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
citing 5D it talks about facilities that
 
06:36:23.750 --> 06:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
are rated up to and including one
 
06:36:27.868 --> 06:36:27.878 align:start position:0%
megawatt yet this bill as proposed talks
 
06:36:30.670 --> 06:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
about facilities that are not less than
 
06:36:33.830 --> 06:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
five megaw so all those facilities
 
06:36:37.788 --> 06:36:37.798 align:start position:0%
between one and five the comment that uh
 
06:36:43.070 --> 06:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:46.350 --> 06:36:46.360 align:start position:0%
relevant thank you um that raises a
 
06:36:49.070 --> 06:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
point I'd forgotten about representative
 
06:36:51.468 --> 06:36:51.478 align:start position:0%
or The Honorable Cliff B Belo mentioned
 
06:36:54.468 --> 06:36:54.478 align:start position:0%
when he testified on this bill that the
 
06:36:57.070 --> 06:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
language about up to an including five
 
06:36:59.910 --> 06:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
megawatts would be problematic that's
 
06:37:02.030 --> 06:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
another reason why that's another flaw
 
06:37:04.548 --> 06:37:04.558 align:start position:0%
of this bill it doesn't say that it says
 
06:37:06.788 --> 06:37:06.798 align:start position:0%
less than five megawatts this isn't that
 
06:37:08.388 --> 06:37:08.398 align:start position:0%
bill that had that language that was
 
06:37:10.468 --> 06:37:10.478 align:start position:0%
problematic that was a different bill
 
06:37:12.510 --> 06:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
yeah this bill has the correct language
 
06:37:14.830 --> 06:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh representative
 
06:37:20.270 --> 06:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:20.280 --> 06:37:25.310 align:start position:0%
 
comment

06:37:25.310 --> 06:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:29.070 --> 06:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
sorry that was from before I believe
 
06:37:32.750 --> 06:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
sorry you you forgot to lower your hand
 
06:37:34.548 --> 06:37:34.558 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying
 
06:37:36.910 --> 06:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
okay yeah sometimes it seems to lower on
 
06:37:38.788 --> 06:37:38.798 align:start position:0%
its own sometimes it doesn't so my
 
06:37:41.510 --> 06:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
apologies okay no problem representative
 
06:37:45.830 --> 06:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:48.350 --> 06:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
recognized um I have two comments to
 
06:37:50.548 --> 06:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
make um one is that there was a very
 
06:37:53.388 --> 06:37:53.398 align:start position:0%
minor Amendment proposed to this it
 
06:37:55.830 --> 06:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't formally written by OS but the
 
06:37:57.590 --> 06:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
minor amendment was to allow
 
06:38:00.590 --> 06:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities to cross Municipal lines
 
06:38:03.590 --> 06:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh to better aggregate energy uh and
 
06:38:04.670 --> 06:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
thought that that was a reasonable
 
06:38:06.150 --> 06:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I thought that perhaps
 
06:38:07.310 --> 06:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
that was the direction that this
 
06:38:10.030 --> 06:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
committee was headed uh because I think
 
06:38:12.310 --> 06:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
it's really important that we look at
 
06:38:15.230 --> 06:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
all the testimony we heard and um the
 
06:38:18.670 --> 06:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
public input on this process we had
 
06:38:21.788 --> 06:38:21.798 align:start position:0%
145 uh people in support of this bill we
 
06:38:24.948 --> 06:38:24.958 align:start position:0%
had nine opposing this bill and of those
 
06:38:28.510 --> 06:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
nine eight were um representatives and
 
06:38:32.110 --> 06:38:32.120 align:start position:0%
one was Donna gamos from eversource so I
 
06:38:34.628 --> 06:38:34.638 align:start position:0%
think it's pretty clear when you look at
 
06:38:37.708 --> 06:38:37.718 align:start position:0%
um the need and the demand from
 
06:38:39.628 --> 06:38:39.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities they are chopping at the
 
06:38:41.548 --> 06:38:41.558 align:start position:0%
bit to get this and this is something
 
06:38:43.548 --> 06:38:43.558 align:start position:0%
that uh our state is very much in favor
 
06:38:46.510 --> 06:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
of as a global whole so I'm just shocked
 
06:38:47.868 --> 06:38:47.878 align:start position:0%
that the first thing out of the gate is
 
06:38:50.468 --> 06:38:50.478 align:start position:0%
an itl rather than a retain with a minor
 
06:38:52.430 --> 06:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank
 
06:38:59.548 --> 06:38:59.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:03.948 --> 06:39:03.958 align:start position:0%
ssuch yes thank you Mr chairman um well
 
06:39:07.910 --> 06:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say that uh the
 
06:39:11.270 --> 06:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor of this bill represent
 
06:39:15.548 --> 06:39:15.558 align:start position:0%
O'Brien came to us and uh said they were
 
06:39:18.350 --> 06:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
working collaboratively with their local
 
06:39:22.030 --> 06:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
utility and that was going fine and it
 
06:39:25.350 --> 06:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
seems to me that this is another uh
 
06:39:28.190 --> 06:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to appear that the state
 
06:39:29.910 --> 06:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
wants to control what a local
 
06:39:32.150 --> 06:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
municipality might want to do with it
 
06:39:34.350 --> 06:39:34.360 align:start position:0%
with its own resources
 
06:39:36.350 --> 06:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
so I don't know why we're we're trying
 
06:39:40.388 --> 06:39:40.398 align:start position:0%
to prevent towns and and and cities from
 
06:39:42.190 --> 06:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
doing what's best in the best interest
 
06:39:45.310 --> 06:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
of their population by mandating that
 
06:39:48.310 --> 06:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
they do it the way we decide it even
 
06:39:50.590 --> 06:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
though we don't live in that town so I I
 
06:39:53.110 --> 06:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
think this this is a good
 
06:39:56.468 --> 06:39:56.478 align:start position:0%
bill we're talking about HP 407 are you
 
06:39:58.830 --> 06:39:58.840 align:start position:0%

549 this uh question is open for
 
06:44:14.270 --> 06:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
discussion I'll start the discussion by
 
06:44:16.990 --> 06:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
saying that I requested the committee
 
06:44:18.750 --> 06:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
this morning when I introduced this bill
 
06:44:21.910 --> 06:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
to retain it so that we can investigate
 
06:44:27.628 --> 06:44:27.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:32.430 --> 06:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
suitably appropriate method to deal with
 
06:44:34.150 --> 06:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh the energy efficiency resource
 
06:44:37.030 --> 06:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
standard put it into statute and also
 
06:44:41.110 --> 06:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
deal with a funding mechanism that is
 
06:44:44.150 --> 06:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
sustainable in the long run so I ask the
 
06:44:46.788 --> 06:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
committee to retain the bill so that we
 
06:44:49.270 --> 06:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
can work on what I think would be an
 
06:44:49.280 --> 06:44:51.388 align:start position:0%
can work on what I think would be an
interesting

06:44:51.388 --> 06:44:51.398 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
06:44:53.830 --> 06:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
possibility uh further discussion
 
06:44:57.430 --> 06:44:57.440 align:start position:0%

06:45:29.628 --> 06:45:29.638 align:start position:0%

whether we could have a session on
