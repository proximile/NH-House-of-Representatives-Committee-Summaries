these whoever is offering an amendment i
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
know nothing about it
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
was not shown the courtesy of having it
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
sent to me
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%

about this bill
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
senator no it just prevents
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
the village districts from being exempt
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%

reporter

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
reporter
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm not sure if this
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh question
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
can be asked at this point um my
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
understanding about the amendment
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
is that it includes language that was in
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
the original bill in the senate
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if the senator would
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
be able to tell us why it was removed
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
but i don't know if that's appropriate
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
now because well it sends us i mean
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative reed who you heard from
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
just briefly
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
is the author of the amendment so maybe
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
we could wait till
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
the substance of the amendment
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
is language that was in senator reagan's
 
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
bill originally
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
and was removed in the senate senator
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
ray could you advise us as to
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%

that i wanted to reintroduce or rather
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
put an amendment that reintroduced his
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
original language
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
but you can rest assured and you can
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
language that it was introduced that was
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
introduced in the senate that it is
 
00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:08.949 align:start position:0%
introduced in the senate that it is
verbatim

00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
verbatim
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
exactly word for word the exact uh
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
uh bill that uh senator reagan
 
00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:16.069 align:start position:0%
uh bill that uh senator reagan
introduced

00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
um so with that uh and again my
 
00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:19.910 align:start position:0%
um so with that uh and again my
apologies

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
apologies
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
to senator reagan that he didn't receive
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
any of my communications
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
um i would like to talk about the
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
original purpose of this bill
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh sb 84 and let me just be clear i am
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
not giving testimony on the
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
municipal amendment that was added in
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
the senate that is before you now
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
um i cannot speak to it i have not
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
reviewed it i'm not giving an opinion on
 
00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:41.509 align:start position:0%
reviewed it i'm not giving an opinion on
that

00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
the original sb84 is what's known as a
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
purple paint law
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps some of you have heard of this
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
or seen this before
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
many states have already adopted this
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
the issue that exists and the reason
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
many states have adopted this
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
is um particularly in rural states with
 
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.590 align:start position:0%
is um particularly in rural states with
um

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
especially with a prominent hunting
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
community landowners have to post
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
their land as no trespassing in order to
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
prevent people from coming onto the land
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
the way our current rsa
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
stands currently is that in order to
 
00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:17.910 align:start position:0%
stands currently is that in order to
post

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
post
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
you have to purchase signs that have
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
specific size lettering
 
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
includes your name includes your address
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
and those signs have to be every 100
 
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.710 align:start position:0%
and those signs have to be every 100
yards

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
yards
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
and so for a property with a relatively
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
large perimeter this isn't just
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
expensive but it's also very time
 
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.550 align:start position:0%
expensive but it's also very time
consuming

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
consuming
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
and there's been all stories of people
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
getting texts posting but the main
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
issue is that the signs themselves are
 
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.269 align:start position:0%
issue is that the signs themselves are
very

00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh susceptible to storm damage and also
 
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.550 align:start position:0%
uh susceptible to storm damage and also
tampering

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
tampering
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
um there have been multiple instances
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
that have gone to court um
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
of hunter's unethical hunters uh
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
tampering with signs in order to kind of
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
excuse going on to the property
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
um i personally serve on the fish and
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
game committee and this has been an
 
00:16:58.959 --> 00:16:59.749 align:start position:0%
game committee and this has been an
issue

00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
that um really has taken off recently
 
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
which has been a huge
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
struggle between the uh the landowner
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
community that is concerned about their
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
privacy rights
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
and some other members in the hunting
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
community not all
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
um and that is that um recently maybe
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
some of you know that these wildlife
 
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.429 align:start position:0%
some of you know that these wildlife
cameras

00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
not the ones that you have to go and
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
physically check the sd card
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
but there's a new kind of wildlife
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
camera that's being produced relatively
 
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.829 align:start position:0%
camera that's being produced relatively
inexpensively

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
inexpensively
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
that immediately pings your phone
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
and live streams video now our current
 
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.190 align:start position:0%
and live streams video now our current
rsa

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
or our current statute allows anyone to
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
put these
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
wildlife cameras on properties so long
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
as that property
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh private property is not posted so the
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
problem is
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
the and this is why the landowners
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
association and why the new hampshire
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
farm bureau was very much in favor of
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
senator reagan's bill
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
um people can essentially put
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term spy cameras on
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
your private property and
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
immediately see if you are on your
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
property what you're doing
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
etc so um the
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
in the senate hearing this had
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely no opposition and testimony
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
it had very very broad-based bipartisan
 
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.270 align:start position:0%
it had very very broad-based bipartisan
support

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
senator reagan obviously was the sponsor
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
but senator guida and senator bradley
 
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.510 align:start position:0%
but senator guida and senator bradley
both

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
supported it as well as senator waters
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
senator and senator rebecca
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
cuoca perkins and also the communities
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
that i just mentioned the new hampshire
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
landowners association the new hampshire
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
farm bureau
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
and officials from the new hampshire
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
fish and game department
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
specifically uh colonel jordan and paul
 
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
sanderson i
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
paul sanderson specifically who is the
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
legal counsel for the new hampshire fish
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
and game department
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
said that he would be joining to testify
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear you read his name so i
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
don't know if he's coming in late but if
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
he doesn't make it today
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
then i'm sure he will send along a
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
message about the necessity regarding
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
of issue they've been having about
 
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.549 align:start position:0%
of issue they've been having about
landowner

00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
landowner
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
privacy um now that whole issue about
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not people can put
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
up cameras that's something that will be
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
dealt with later
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
but all of the stakeholders have agreed
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
that making posting easier
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
cheaper and more tamper resistant is
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
something that we can all do and this is
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
why so many states have already adopted
 
00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:20.630 align:start position:0%
why so many states have already adopted
this

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
um somewhere in the teens i i apologize
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know the specific number but
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's definitely more than
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
10 states and again they're mostly uh
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
rural states that have a prominent
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
hunting community like
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire um but again it's just is
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
so much cheaper so much
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
quicker and easier and tamper resistant
 
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:41.669 align:start position:0%
quicker and easier and tamper resistant
um

00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that um and i know
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
this may seem like a small thing but
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's several
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
studies and articles already on the
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
issue with the rising cost of lumber
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
many of these landowners will timber
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
their their land
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
if they have to post they have to put it
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
currently with signage
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
then they have to put nail holes into
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
their trees which does damage their
 
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.270 align:start position:0%
their trees which does damage their
lumber

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
lumber
 
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:05.919 align:start position:0%
and reduces the the um quality and
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
therefore the
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
the price that they can get um and a
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
couple questions i've heard
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
previously about this that i've gone
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
through the trouble of researching the
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
answers for
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
the first question that i heard was well
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
how do we distinguish purple markings
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
from trail markings so there's a few
 
00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:21.430 align:start position:0%
from trail markings so there's a few
things

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
again this is so ubiquitous that
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
actually several
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
paint companies create a a color a
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
purple spray paint color specifically
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of posting
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
um so it's so ubiquitous that people who
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
do trails no longer use the color purple
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
but in addition trail markings
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
themselves are
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
usually either circle or square little
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
pieces of plastic mailed to a tree
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
in the case of paint they may be
 
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.149 align:start position:0%
in the case of paint they may be
horizontal

00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
horizontal
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh hashings but not uh long
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
vertical stripes which is what this and
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
other states
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
um set as the purple paint the other
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
thing is that if there were existing
 
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.510 align:start position:0%
thing is that if there were existing
purple

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
purple
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
marked trails which have probably been
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
changed by now
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
um if there are existing purple mark
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
trails those are on
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
property that's not posted so anyone
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
who's wishing to post their land
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
obviously a trail
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
is not marked that's already crossing
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
into their land so there would not be
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
any confusion the last question i'll
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
bring up that i've heard is the issue of
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
publicity how do
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
we make sure people know this and the
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
fish and game department
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
had you know issues licenses every uh
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
and has to do education every year on
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
on the rules and regulations and as well
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
as statute
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
for hunters such as open seasons proper
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
methods of take what caliber weapon can
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
be used
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
when does both seasons start those types
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
of things um and so this is just part of
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
would be part of their normal
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh education process that happens every
 
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:53.990 align:start position:0%
uh education process that happens every
year

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
um i realize i might seem like i'm
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
rambling saul in there
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
we have any questions from the municipal
 
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.630 align:start position:0%
we have any questions from the municipal
committee

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative reed
 
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
see eddie let me ask representative reed
 
00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.350 align:start position:0%
see eddie let me ask representative reed
this

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
appears to be from hearing from
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
senator reagan by
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
a law to govern
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
the uh the privacy issue or 91a
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh the right to know provision of our
 
00:22:34.159 --> 00:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
uh the right to know provision of our
statutes

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
but you you're talking mostly about
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
hunting and so forth is so what's the
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
connection that you see
 
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
trespassing so let me be very clear as
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
senator reagan introduced sb 84
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
it did not have anything to do with 91a
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
or municipal issues
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
it was the purple paint law as is
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
written in the amendment that i have
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
emailed to all of you
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
um the senate decided to use sb 84
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
as a vehicle for this municipal 91a
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
piece that i cannot speak to
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
so they had added this non-germain
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
amendment which is why it's before you
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
now instead of in fish and game the
 
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
original understanding was that
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
sb 84 was likely to go to fish and game
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
because it was the purple paint law
 
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
which is why i am involved so i cannot
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
speak to you as the bill stands before
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
you right now
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
because the non-german amendment that
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
the senate uh added my understanding
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
um because there was absolutely no
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
opposition and there was huge support
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
from multiple groups as well as
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
bipartisan senators my understanding is
 
00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:37.830 align:start position:0%
bipartisan senators my understanding is
that

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
the senate committee decided to use sb
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
84 as a vehicle for this 91a
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
piece and um kind of
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
as an oversight replaced the entire bill
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
which was not something that they were
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
you know particularly passionate about
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
um instead of simply adding it to the
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
bill so just to be clear
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
my amendment that i've sent before you
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
simply adds it does not replace the
 
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.590 align:start position:0%
simply adds it does not replace the
municipal

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
91a piece that is before you but it add
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
re-adds the original language
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
back into the bill as senator reagan
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
um had originally had well um
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative reed you are the the
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is that correct i am the
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%

this
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh bill uh as amended ought to be
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
reviewed by that committee um
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
i would i i i hesitate to make my chair
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
mad at me
 
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.909 align:start position:0%
mad at me
[Laughter]

00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
but um i'm hap i personally would be
 
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:43.909 align:start position:0%

to review in our committee but i'm also
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
because there was no opposition at all
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
and i am confident that the chair of our
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
committee has no opposition to this
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
um that i'm happy for this committee to
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
just rule on it
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh as well so it is up to your
 
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:00.400 align:start position:0%

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative reed for taking my
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
question um i just
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
want to make sure in your amendment
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
which adds the purple paint
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
back it also makes if i if i read this
 
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:18.789 align:start position:0%
back it also makes if i if i read this
correctly

00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
it makes writing in the name and the
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
address of the landowner
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
or keeps it optional is that correct
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
correct so it doesn't
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
remove the current language that so the
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
current language in that second section
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
is what currently exists in terms of
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
what we need to post and as you can see
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh complicated i guess is the word and
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
so instead of removing
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
all of that language it simply says that
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
that is optional
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
um so if if people wanted to be
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
really super clear two letter tall no
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
trespassing and just to be clear
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's no trespassing it's not no hunting
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
so it's inclusive of no hunting but it's
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
simply no trespassing
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
um but two inch tall no trespassing
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
letters with their name and address and
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
everything if they wanted to do that
 
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
they still
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
can and that would still be considered
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have to use purple paint
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
in addition to that
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
is the point of keeping that language in
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
and adding in optional
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
primarily for people who have already
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions from
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.269 align:start position:0%
the committee
representative

00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
representative

see none uh very much is christina
 
00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:30.070 align:start position:0%
see none uh very much is christina

snyder
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
there to speak uh member of the public
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
hello uh yes this is christina snyder
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
yesterday hi uh thank you um
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
yes my name is christina snyder i'm from
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
chester new hampshire
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh rockingham district four is my um
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
district for the house of
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
representatives and i'm just here to uh
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
voice my support of this amendment and
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
um this comes down to me an issue of
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
making it easier to exercise your
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
property rights
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
um i moved to chester in 2015 and we do
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
post our property
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
which is our right to do um it it is
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
actually a tedious process
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
to do this properly we have to actually
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
lug the ladder
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
with some nails signs and we have to go
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
around to the perimeter of the property
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
and put nails in our trees
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
and uh as representative reed mentioned
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
nails do
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
inhibit the growth of our trees and also
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
increase the tree's vulnerability to
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
disease so
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
we hate to do it but yet we'd like to
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
exercise our property rights
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
so so what we do is we go around and we
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
put these signs up
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
however inevitably the signs are
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
generally ripped down within a short
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
and we also have had issues of animals
 
00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:52.950 align:start position:0%
and we also have had issues of animals
chewing

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
chewing
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
up the signs we think that flying
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
squirrels use some of the material for
 
00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:57.750 align:start position:0%
squirrels use some of the material for
nests

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
nests
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
and then so we change to a harder
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
plastic sign
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
and we notice that those are also being
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
chewed as well
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
um so the animals people do uh take down
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
the signs
 
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
and it's it's a tedious process and i
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
think it it should not
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
be this difficult to exercise your
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
property rights
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh people have the right to post their
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
property and it could be for any reason
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh they could have no trespass because
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
they have sensitive habitat
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
and um there are actually some hunters
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
that post their own property
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
and and it's it's their right to do so
 
00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:31.190 align:start position:0%
and and it's it's their right to do so
and

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
in in addition um some things that just
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
in discussions with other people
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
is is the way that this method is now it
 
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:39.909 align:start position:0%
is is the way that this method is now it
is

00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult for for uh elderly
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
people for disabled
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
people for for those uh property rights
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
owners to be able to do something like
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
this they have to ask for help
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
now if this were to change to the purple
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
paint method it's it's it's very easier
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
it's uh from my understanding the the
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
the paint line only has to be between
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
three and five feet off the ground you
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to bring a ladder and post
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
these signs up high
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
to try to keep them out of uh reach of
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
of people
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
that might be taking them down um it's
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's just that over over the years we've
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
just had so many issues
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
that that you might even want to give up
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
and it it just comes down again to
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
i'll reiterate one last time it's just
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
property rights it
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
you know other states have been been
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
taking this up across the country i
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
believe maine does it
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
um i think it's the way to go it's the
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
way it's going to be it's just going to
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
make it easier for property owners
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
and for all people uh to to be able to
 
00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:39.110 align:start position:0%
and for all people uh to to be able to
do

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
to use this method and um so i just will
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
end with
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
i uh have my i hope you support this
 
00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:47.110 align:start position:0%
i uh have my i hope you support this
amendment

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you um
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of time talking about
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
this amendment to
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
sba for this is really not the
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate time to be
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
discussing an amendment since nobody has
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
nobody that's been noticed
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
to speak to this bill has that amendment
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
representative ford did you come in i do
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
i want to let you know that
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative truleven notified me that
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
she's having trouble getting into the
 
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.190 align:start position:0%
she's having trouble getting into the
meeting

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
so it's a technical issue or something
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
i'll give her a call
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you christine and secondly i'm
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
assuming then that you don't want me to
 
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.630 align:start position:0%
assuming then that you don't want me to
ask

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
ask
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
this person yeah i think i'd like to uh
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
i think i'd let it go on tomorrow
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
thank you i think i'd like to end the
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
discussion and then that the amendment
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
is really not before us yet
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
that will have to be introduced by a
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
member of this uh committee
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
if if if uh if it's needed
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh and i'd also uh like to discuss the
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
that uh the majority of what we've
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
spoken to so far
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
i i don't think is is uh
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
apropos for the municipal county
 
00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.870 align:start position:0%
apropos for the municipal county
committee

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
i believe that this really needs to be
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
seen by the official name
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
committee and i will take the action to
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
contact the chair of that committee to
 
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.389 align:start position:0%
contact the chair of that committee to
see

00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
if they want to take this bill and hear
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
it or if they just want to
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
advise us as to how we are forward yes
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
i have a question mr chairman do we have
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
the authority to separate
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
the two sections of this build and make
 
00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:35.750 align:start position:0%
the two sections of this build and make
it

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
as to control it was originally two
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
separate builds
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
although they've combined the two
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh subject matters that really don't
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
belong together
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
okay if we would pass to
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
pass 84 senate bill 84
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
to the fishing game would the first
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
section also
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
yes that that being that we have to
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
it's been referred to us so with we have
 
00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:17.830 align:start position:0%
it's been referred to us so with we have
the

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh the authority and the responsibility
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
to rule on this bill
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh although i i have the freedom to
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh consult with the chair of the uh
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
the other committee the fish and game
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
committee to see if they want to take on
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
a second committee responsibility to
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
hear this as well
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
then we would put our thoughts together
 
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
to decide how we wanted to
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
not being too cute no we can't split the
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
bill up and have two bills now
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's not that we won't even do that
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
next session we couldn't do that this
 
00:32:52.399 --> 00:32:53.269 align:start position:0%
next session we couldn't do that this
session

00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
all right if i could concern is i think
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
for no law on the open meeting
 
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
law rather certainly belongs here
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
right it does so um
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
well i guess the way we handled that is
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
we could bring the two
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
committees together and have a joint
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
committee meeting
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh or uh we could also uh
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
my discussions with the clerk
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh we could just get advice from the
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
other committee that we think
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
is affected by this and move from that
 
00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:32.549 align:start position:0%
is affected by this and move from that
so

00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
i think we've heard from representative
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
reid uh
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
she's the clerk of the other committee
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
her her judgment that the committee
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
chair has no problem with uh
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
moving forward with this language as is
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to speak to him myself
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
representative lang is the chair of that
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
committee and i'll speak to him before
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
we get back
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
together to accept this next one mr
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
chair if i may just insert very quickly
 
00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:59.190 align:start position:0%
chair if i may just insert very quickly
um

00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
so first of all the amendment is before
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
i have emailed it to all of you so you
 
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
have access to it but you are correct
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
that had the senate amended this
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
in the way i think they intended which
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
is to simply add the municipal police it
 
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
would have created essentially an
 
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.750 align:start position:0%
would have created essentially an
omnibus

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
omnibus
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
and our committee the fish and game
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
committee has
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
weighed in on pieces of omnibuses in
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
other committees that affected our
 
00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:21.909 align:start position:0%
other committees that affected our
committee

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
um and advised them so that you mr chair
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
you are correct that that would be the
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
the procedure right so i i'll do
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
i'll take the action do that between now
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
and our next meeting on
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
the but uh we still
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
the floor is still open others have
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
questions and
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
we have anyone else in the public that
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
has presented themselves to speak to
 
00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.109 align:start position:0%
has presented themselves to speak to
this

00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
we have also nhma uh cordell johnson
 
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:49.669 align:start position:0%
we have also nhma uh cordell johnson
that's

00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak uh mr johnson are you
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
are you there with us
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
yes i am uh thank you mr chairman and
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
um and and we we neither support nor
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill but
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
i think maybe i can provide some
 
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.829 align:start position:0%
i think maybe i can provide some
clarification

00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
and i am speaking on the bill as
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
presented to you
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh nothing at all about the amendment
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
this bill as introduced in the senate
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
was an
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill there were two parts
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
introduced by senator reagan that had to
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
do with posting of land
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
part three introduced by senator waters
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
had to do with village districts being
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
subject to the right to know law
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
so this provision was in the bill all
 
00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.630 align:start position:0%
so this provision was in the bill all
along

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
along
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
um but it was senator waters it was
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
senator waters
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
uh part of the bill not senator reagan's
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
which i think is why senator reagan
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh may not have been able to answer all
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
of the questions
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
so um i'm only speaking to to this part
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
and as i said in the senate this
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
this doesn't really change the law
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's already clear that village district
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
that public bodies of village districts
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
are subject to the right to know law
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
but the right to know law i think does
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
not expressly
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
refer to village districts it talks
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
about political subdivisions
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
and a village district very definitely
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
political subdivision but apparently
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
there were in senator waters district
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
some one or two village districts where
 
00:36:31.599 --> 00:36:32.069 align:start position:0%
some one or two village districts where
the

00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
commissioners or others seemed to think
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
they were not
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
subject to the right to know law so he
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to put this in
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
just to make it absolutely clear that
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
so that seems to speak to the question
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative status had earlier yes
 
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:48.470 align:start position:0%
representative status had earlier yes
the

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
yeah she asked whether whether they were
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
specifically exempted from the right to
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
know law
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
and the answer is no they're not
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
specifically exempted
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
they're not specifically mentioned but
 
00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:00.069 align:start position:0%
they're not specifically mentioned but
um

00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
they are a political subdivision uh and
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
therefore they are subject to the right
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
to know law
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
so um and my testimony in the senate was
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh as i said the bill the bill doesn't
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
really change the law
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
but if if you think it is helpful to
 
00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.270 align:start position:0%
but if if you think it is helpful to
clarify

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh for people in village districts that
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
they are subject to the right to know
 
00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:21.589 align:start position:0%
they are subject to the right to know
law

00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
then i think that it probably is useful
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
and and that's all i have for you but
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer questions
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr johnson are there any
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
for the nhma
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none i believe that's the end of
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
our testimony unless we have anyone else
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
public who has uh signed up
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
or a step forward and i'm
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion what i'm going to do is
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
i will
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
speak with the chair of the fish and
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
game committee
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
and uh get there uh feeling like if
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
beat me to the punch from for um when i
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
had it up earlier
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
i was just temporarily raising it again
 
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
now because i thought i saw that
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
paul smith what that clerk paul smith
 
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:22.710 align:start position:0%
paul smith what that clerk paul smith
was

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
um raising his hand to point that out
 
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.150 align:start position:0%
um raising his hand to point that out
but

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
it seems he's disappeared so never mind
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
mr clerk do you have a comment you'd
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
like to say
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
uh yes mr chairman thank you uh so just
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
to be clear
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
the bill before you uh today
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
is what's before you any amendment that
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
has to deal with anything outside of the
 
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
purview of this legislation that needs
 
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
any involvement from another committee
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
is going to need a non-germane public
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
amendment hearing
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
so i want to just be clear on that
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
because um
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
any anything that's not within this bill
 
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.710 align:start position:0%
any anything that's not within this bill
text

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
text
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh as it came to you whether it was
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
introduced in the senate and and not
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
adopted or not
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
um is is not germane to this bill
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
um you know what what the senate does
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
the senate does
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh anything that that you know is
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
outside of the norm
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh of this committee's purview uh is not
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
really germane and you'll need a
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
your hearing is that uh needed to be
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
accomplished next monday when we
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh accept the bill uh if you're going to
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
have a non-germain amendment public
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
hearing you're going to have to notice
 
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.190 align:start position:0%
hearing you're going to have to notice
it

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
and that amendment is going to have to
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
be available
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
for people to testify on before you
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
go into executive session and a little
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
inside baseball do we have
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
time now to notice it for next monday
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
um yes you you would
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
i would just i would just caution you
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
however as
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
um as anything that that isn't within
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
the purview of this
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
committee by rule uh that is
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
those things that may affect other
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
policy areas
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
really shouldn't be adopted by the this
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
policy committee
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of uh
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of what you wish to do with the
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
bill that's before you
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
um that really would be the purview of
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
another policy committee
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
to do that with a bill that's in their
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
possession so
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
um mr clerk what would you advise would
 
00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.349 align:start position:0%
um mr clerk what would you advise would
you

00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
advise to transfer this to the fish and
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
date committee uh well you can't do that
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
now because uh we've you've had a public
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
hearing on it and
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
frankly this bill has nothing to do with
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
fishing game um
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
it has to do with right what about the
 
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.470 align:start position:0%
it has to do with right what about the
amendment

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
um i would suggest that you know if if
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
the member um wishes to have
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know that a piece that that deals
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
with with fish and game law
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
um that that should go through its own
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
its own committee um uh internal
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
committee in the senate
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
well i i will say that the senate still
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
has possession of many house bills and
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
the senate has has far less stringent
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
rules than we do about germaness and
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
if the senate wished to add something in
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
on their side they could certainly do
 
00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.349 align:start position:0%
on their side they could certainly do
that

00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
um or i do believe that the fish and
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
game committee
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
may have already passed out the the
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
bills that were in there
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
within their purview to deal with um but
 
00:41:38.319 --> 00:41:38.710 align:start position:0%
within their purview to deal with um but
uh

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
you know the legislative session still
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
has another year to go so
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh why don't we take this offline i
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
think i need a little more
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
advice absolutely mr clerk and
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
we'll just we'll make a decision yes
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
very secretive
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
here i asked if we could separate the
 
00:42:00.839 --> 00:42:02.390 align:start position:0%
here i asked if we could separate the
bill

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
can in fact the senate separate the bill
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
i know the question is clear i'm not i'm
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
not sure i
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
i understand i think what he's saying is
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
could the senate
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
have a bill on 91a and then also a then
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
a second bill on the purple payment
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
the senate again the senate can do
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
whatever the senate wants
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
as you as you know there have been bills
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
that the senate passed that that deal
 
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.030 align:start position:0%
that the senate passed that that deal
with

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
12 different policy areas uh at once
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
um so i i mean um
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
they they can they can
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
they can do what they want but the bill
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
before you as it is
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
currently um is you know it deals with
 
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
three specific things
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
um third-party inspections the housing
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
and conservation planning program and
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh prohibiting the installation of of
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
heating systems
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
i mean that's that's what's before you
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh other things
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
beyond that are not before you and and
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
that's that's the point okay thank you
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
mr appreciate your clarification
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
the purple paint part of the bill is not
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
before us the only products before us is
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
the 91a
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh portion of the bill the the rest of
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
needs a new disposition okay okay
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
no i please let me see it say this okay
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
this is not a fishing game bill i don't
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
know why you're calling it a fishing
 
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
game bill
 
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
it is a criminal trespass bill it's
 
00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.030 align:start position:0%
it is a criminal trespass bill it's
about

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
no trespassing now we're getting it
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
confused that it's all about no hunting
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
and it's not
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's a criminal trespass bill
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
okay well we're going to take this
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
offline and we're going to decide where
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
it goes
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
but the point question that bill
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
assuming doesn't belong in front of the
 
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
discipline council
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
i think it might do you handle criminal
 
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
would go to a criminal trespass
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
committee whoever handles that it will
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
not go to fish and game
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
fishing game has nothing to do with this
 
00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:11.270 align:start position:0%
fishing game has nothing to do with this
bill

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
yeah we will we will decide offline
 
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh the best the best venue for this okay
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to clear that up
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
you seem to think this is official game
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
bill it is not a fish and game bill
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your input okay thank you
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative no it's okay you
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
think it's you think it's criminal
 
00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.230 align:start position:0%
think it's you think it's criminal
justice

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
justice
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know who it is yeah i just i
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
talk with representative guthrie about
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
separating the bill
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you haven't closed the
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
hearing yet though
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think right now the bill before
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
us representative doesn't have two parts
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
to separate it only has one and that's
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
the right to know heart
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
it would have two parts if we amended it
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
with this amendment but right now it
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't so
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
separating it isn't something that we
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
can do because it's only got one part
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question yeah yeah
 
00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:06.630 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question yeah yeah
yeah

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
the second part is is not there it's
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
just floating in the air
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
right what i'm going to do so there's no
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
mystery i'm going to sit with the
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
house leadership for the folks who would
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
sign these bills to the various
 
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.510 align:start position:0%
sign these bills to the various
committees

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to present this as a
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
section of the bill that doesn't
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be assigned to our
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
committee and they're going to use their
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
expertise inside
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
which is science or how it should be
 
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.030 align:start position:0%
which is science or how it should be
deficient

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
deficient
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i just don't understand
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
some of these on the bus bills not just
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
one in particular
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
anymore but it seems like
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
when we get into on the bus that really
 
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.750 align:start position:0%
when we get into on the bus that really
gets

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
gets
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
murky great and i'm wondering how the
 
00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.990 align:start position:0%
murky great and i'm wondering how the
animals

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
animals
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
when there's europe in favor of say
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
section one and two but you don't like
 
00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.349 align:start position:0%
section one and two but you don't like
sect

00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
sect
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
three right i don't know if you're
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
drawing in they have to vote for all
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
three so what we can do
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
one of our options is to delete sections
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
of bills and senate bills that come to
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
us that we can delete sections
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
we could offer an amendment that would
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
delete section two with section four or
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
whatever section
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
that's hopefully we don't get it right
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
one of the options at the end is to go
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
to a community of conference which is
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
that can be often kind of messy but
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's when the senate doesn't agree
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
with what we're doing we don't know
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
what they're doing they're not a
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
committee is signed fight it out
 
00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:42.710 align:start position:0%
committee is signed fight it out
decide

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to interrupt um i i just
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i was referencing the wrong
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill i was referencing the next bill i
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
didn't know exactly where you were when
 
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.069 align:start position:0%
didn't know exactly where you were when
when

00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
i was called in to uh to to chat with
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
you all i apologize i thought you were
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
on 86 i didn't realize you were in 84.
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
but that being said 84 my comment stands
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
that 84 before you
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
is is a one bill uh frankly it's a
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
two-sentence bill that that deals with
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
public body it has nothing to do
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
with how it was introduced um and again
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know so i just wanted to clarify
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
the issue before you is as
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
it is uh presented to you sorry
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
my uh my strategy is to go back to the
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
speaker's office and talk to the
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
those by his staff that have signed
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
um representative dylan i will tell you
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
the speaker and i sat down and assigned
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
all these bills and the bill
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
was assigned correctly because the the
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
the one sentence that has to do with you
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
um is what the text is what the text
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter but with the with the
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
amendment now
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
showing itself is this should just be
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
the amendment is not germane um if if
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
you all want to add it as a non-german
 
00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:56.950 align:start position:0%
you all want to add it as a non-german
amendment

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's what within your purview
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
but i but what i'm trying to suggest to
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
you is
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
because of the elements that that that
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
bill contains
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
does not belong to the purview of this
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee and that's why it's
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's objectionable okay thank you
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
all right uh i believe that's the the
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
last comment to be heard on senate bill
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
84 that's before us at this point
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
there's still some work to be done
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
and i have the answers might i make him
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
comment please
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead uh
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
it appears that uh the only reason that
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
might be added is because it was
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
added it was uh present in the bill
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
previously i would suggest that uh
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
if they want to add the amendment that
 
00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.309 align:start position:0%
if they want to add the amendment that
they

00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
add it to a bill that it would be
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
germaine to
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
not rather not giving it to us since we
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
haven't had
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get the amendment yet
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's not really pertinent you know i
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
would i would suggest that uh
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative reed find a bill that the
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
amendment is pertinent to and uh
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
get somebody on that committee to uh add
 
00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.309 align:start position:0%
get somebody on that committee to uh add
it

00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%

to introduce senate bill 86
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
the bill was considered by municipal
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
and election affairs committee
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
earlier this year it passed
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh 5-0 in that committee
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
went to the floor of the senate and
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
passed 23-1
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
with all three parts as are presented to
 
00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.230 align:start position:0%
with all three parts as are presented to
you

00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh if i speak
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh primarily to part one which is the
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
part that
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
i am responsible for and i
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
believe that both uh senators
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
perkins cuoca and senator morris are
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
prepared to
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
testify on parts two and three uh
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
i'll stay on uh in the event that
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
they're not present
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
um part one
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
is a bill that was introduced in
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
2019 and
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh it needed some additional work
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh the bill that was passed in 2020
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
is now the bill that is in front of you
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
do you can recall the 2020 session
 
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh there were a lot of bills that passed
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
from one chamber
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
and uh were unable to be considered in
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
the second chamber
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh in this case uh part one
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh was senate bill uh 151
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
it passed in 2020 and then
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh was no longer considered uh
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
because uh of covid uh in the house
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
during 2020. so here it is reintroduced
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
um while it was introduced in 2019 there
 
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:44.870 align:start position:0%
um while it was introduced in 2019 there
was

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
concern that the
 
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
association of general contractors and
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire municipal association
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
needed to come together to work on the
 
00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.430 align:start position:0%
needed to come together to work on the
bill

00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
the bill is trying to
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
allow planning boards several routes
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
for how to do third party inspections of
 
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.349 align:start position:0%
for how to do third party inspections of
construction

00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
construction
 
00:53:09.359 --> 00:53:12.470 align:start position:0%
construction
projects

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
because when there are smaller projects
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
and a third party becomes involved
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh it adds additional costs both to the
 
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.630 align:start position:0%
uh it adds additional costs both to the
contractor

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
and it's hurting new hampshire
 
00:53:25.119 --> 00:53:27.270 align:start position:0%
and it's hurting new hampshire
contractors

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
the original contractor who has a stamp
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
either architectural
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
or engineering uh can verify
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
that the project is being built to plan
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
and provide that assurance back to the
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
planning department
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill allows but if the
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
planning board
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
in the municipality wishes to have that
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
third-party review
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
if they think that it's important on on
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
a particular project
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
then they'll insist on that and uh and
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
go forward so it gives them several
 
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.390 align:start position:0%
go forward so it gives them several
routes

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
routes
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
um in the end the both parties are very
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
supportive of the bill in addition
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire board of realtors
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire housing are also
 
00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:25.950 align:start position:0%
supportive and
 
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:30.790 align:start position:0%
supportive and
[Music]

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
and we had very supportive testimony in
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
the hearing so
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'd be glad to answer questions on part

00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh over what the planning board will
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately do
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
i i think the uh contractors
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
are interested in just having a voice in
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
the process so that they can advise
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh if there are
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
complicated steps in the process and
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
when the third party might be
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
necessary for a phase or a particular
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
and they can they can just work that out
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
it is the negotiation that i think that
 
00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:09.430 align:start position:0%
it is the negotiation that i think that
the

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
contractors were looking for the
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have some input
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
but not there's no expectation of the
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
veto authority
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%

mr looks like the several hands are up
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
the first one was from senator
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
perkins quoca and then we have in order
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
on the list here gary abbott
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
and fordell johnson uh seemingly in
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
response to your question
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
i think the senator program's copeland
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
is planning to speak
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
she should be allowed to talk now if you
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
want to confirm that
 
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
senator perkins poker are you well would
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%

you want to weigh in on section one
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%

present part two thank you
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%

cordell johnson do you want to speak to
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
this section section one or a different
 
00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.950 align:start position:0%
this section section one or a different
section

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes um actually i i want to speak on
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
all three sections but i'll only do
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
section one now okay um
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
as senator khan indicated this is
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
something that was
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh negotiated uh among several parties
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
their contractors have had concerns
 
00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.549 align:start position:0%
their contractors have had concerns
about

00:59:09.549 --> 00:59:09.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
engineers or others to inspect their
 
00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
construction process and overbilling
 
00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:21.510 align:start position:0%
construction process and overbilling
them

00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
and this was a this is a a compromise
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
that we came up with represented
 
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of discussion among the
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
municipal association the associated
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
general contractors
 
00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
i think the association of uh civil
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
engineers that's probably not the exact
 
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
their exact name but um this is what we
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
came up with
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
and uh it's something that i think we're
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
all willing to live with so i would
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
encourage you
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
not to change this language
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
any changes you make are probably gonna
 
00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
make one party um unhappy and we'll have
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
to go back to the drawing board so
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
i encourage you to uh to stick with the
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
language that is in part one
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments on section
 
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.630 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments on section
one

01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
there is one other hand up mr chair from
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
gary abbott
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
mr abbott uh you want to comment on
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh chairman dolan and
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh committee members uh
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'll be brief in light of both cordell
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
senator curran explained it really well
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
it started out as senate bill
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
152 back in 2019
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
the language was worked on over a year
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
with cordell and others
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
and we we did get to this language
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
it really is a simple language doesn't
 
01:00:52.589 --> 01:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
take any authority away from
 
01:00:52.599 --> 01:00:54.309 align:start position:0%
take any authority away from
municipalities

01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
but it involves the applicant where
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
there are uh
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
costs involved and these costs can be
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
anywhere from
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand to a hundred and fifty
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars uh that the
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
applicant or the contractor pays
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
i just want to let you know that the
 
01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:13.670 align:start position:0%
i just want to let you know that the
senate

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
in 2020 passed this by voice vote
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
this was a separate bill all by itself
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
it wasn't part of an omnibus
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
it was too bad of covid that uh we ended
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
up that it was vacated
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
and wasn't acted upon so uh it's great
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
that senator khan resubmitted this bill
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh it ends up as an omnibus but it's
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
section one
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
we totally support it as the language as
 
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's drafted in there
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
i think it gives some new opportunities
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
for municipalities and with that
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
i would answer any questions you might
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
have thank you
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%

would like to
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um i
 
01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
was seeking clarification with regard to
 
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
the nature of the project inspection i
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to know specifically
 
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
does the inspection does it abide by
 
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
rsa building codes or local municipality
 
01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.309 align:start position:0%
rsa building codes or local municipality
codes

01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
codes
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
can somebody um describe that and second
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
part of my question
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
is the language in the bill here
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
states to develop a scope so what
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
exactly is meant by scope
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
that plan of how
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
the um inspection is going to be
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
administered mr abby you want to take a
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
shower sure
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
sure um yeah this uh pertains to there
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
are two
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
processes for the municipality
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
one prior to the approval of a project
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
there is a review that the contractor
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
pays by a third party
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
engineer or inspector kind of thing
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
this section pertains to the second
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
phase in which we're talking about
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
a on-site inspection of while it's being
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
built so
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
say a connection between a sewer line
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
to the new property that kind of thing
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
it is site work inspection
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
so the scope involves the communication
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
we're looking for
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
is that the applicant knows the phases
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
the timing the proper scope so working
 
01:03:59.829 --> 01:03:59.839 align:start position:0%
with the municipality
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's the scope we're looking for is
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
that they talk about the phase and
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
rather than have somebody try to do an
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
inspection 365 days a year
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
they can focus in on this is going to
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
take place in the month of may
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
so that's how the scope fits in there
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
but this really still doesn't give and
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
and i think you got the right
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
answer before earlier is that the town
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
could do whatever they want to do but
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
this allows the applicant to have say
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
as we try to save money over the project
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
in what's necessary for third-party
 
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
inspection so that's where scope comes
 
01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.309 align:start position:0%
inspection so that's where scope comes
in

01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
it all depends on what is actually
 
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
required to do and what isn't required
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
for the inspection
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
so having all the parties know what that
 
01:04:45.839 --> 01:04:46.870 align:start position:0%
so having all the parties know what that
means

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
is so important early on in the project
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
that everybody works together
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
that's really that will create less
 
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
problems that we currently have because
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
in some cases there's no communication
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
this will at least get that ball started
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
in in a very nice way that that's
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
how the functioning of the project is
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
going to go i hope i
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
sure so to be clear it sounds like the
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
scope is simply a project
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
timeline in which certain um
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
events or things will take place in all
 
01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.069 align:start position:0%
events or things will take place in all
the

01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
parties involved are on the same page so
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
and on the same timeline exactly exactly
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't really involve it's
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's separate from when you talk about
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
building codes in the building
 
01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.230 align:start position:0%
building codes in the building
inspectors

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
inspectors
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
this is a different area thank you
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh before we go on let me just
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
say this
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
of those who have signed in on this bill
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
30th have
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
signed that they supported two opposed
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
and one is neutral
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
all right i do believe that's the last
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
person testifying on section one
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
let's move on to section two um
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have senator perkins
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
walker introduce section two
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%

to assist municipalities in working

affordable housing in our communities
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
we all know that housing the housing
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
crisis is urgent
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
and well documented the ability of our
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
state economy to survive and thrive into
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
the next generation depends on having
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
that generation
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
here to take over accounting practices
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
and dental practices to serve on civic
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
boards and to add vitality to our life
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
as a state
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
that said there is so little we can do
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
at the state level to affect housing
 
01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:00.549 align:start position:0%
at the state level to affect housing
policy

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
facilities and their local ordinances
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
have the most control over where
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
and how housing can be built and most if
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
not all of us would agree that this is
 
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
how it should work
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
the hcc cpp does not seek to change that
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
it is a resource and tool for
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities who we all know are
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
struggling and
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
we all wish to support with the tools
 
01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:21.799 align:start position:0%
they need to achieve their
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
self-identified goals
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
hcpp is a four-phase program which
 
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.990 align:start position:0%
hcpp is a four-phase program which
municipalities

01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
voluntarily apply for to aid cities and
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
towns and working towards their zoning
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
goals for their communities
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
we all value new hampshire's beautiful
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
outdoors and want to see the
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
conservation of such spaces balanced
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
with housing
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
that is what hcpp seeks to support
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
there is no funding request being made
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
at this time in the bill
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
part two will simply return hcpp
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
hcpp to statute and allow rulemaking to
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
take place
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
i've worked with the new hampshire
 
01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680 align:start position:0%

preservation alliance on this bill and
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
all are in support of part two
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
we have also added the new hampshire
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
association of realtors by amendment to
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
the program
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
it grows out of a long history of
 
01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
collaboration that goes back as far as
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
2007-2008 known as the growth
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
growth and development roundtable which
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
brought together stakeholders from
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
various industries
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
developers conservation municipalities
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
and others and was a very popular
 
01:08:26.799 --> 01:08:28.229 align:start position:0%
and others and was a very popular
program

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the hcpp got wrapped up in
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
tough budget decisions around the great
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
recession and was removed from statute
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
this bill represents the main
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation of senator fuller clark's
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
sb 43 commission last year
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
studying recommendations on how to
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
address our urgent housing crisis
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you for the
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present part two and i
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any questions
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
thank you senator and may i use this
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ask that
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
those of you who have written testimony
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
could you please send it
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
to the committee so that we have access
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
to that as we consider
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
the exact portion of the process
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
that will happen next week having your
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
testimony degree
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
helps refresh our memories so thank you
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh who else would like to speak to
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
section 2
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 86 anybody on the
 
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
committee yes
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative may i ask the senator yes
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair and thank
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
my question this
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
commission reminds me
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
of the um section of
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
house bill 58 i think it was 586 the
 
01:09:42.719 --> 01:09:43.910 align:start position:0%
house bill 58 i think it was 586 the
housing

01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
bill that we worked on earlier in the
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
year this looks
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
sort of like the housing champion kind
 
01:09:50.239 --> 01:09:51.590 align:start position:0%
sort of like the housing champion kind
of

01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
organization is that am i right in that
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
or is it less powerful than that or
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
about the same in terms of helping
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
communities and allowing them
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any money attached is that
 
01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.430 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any money attached is that
right

01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much representative
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
there are similarities
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
in that um you know both would be
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
completely voluntary for
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
our towns and cities to participate in
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
at this time there's no
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
request for funding to support this
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
program but
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
um this would be it's a separate
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
standalone program where towns and
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
cities could apply
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
at each of the four phases um for
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
for grants for planning assistance and
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
just consultation on
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
how to amend their zoning so it's
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
similar in a way that
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
um all it does is basically provide
 
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
incentives or or
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
tools to our municipalities to support
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
how they look at housing in their own
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
community so yeah similarities thank you
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions yes
 
01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:56.870 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions yes
representative

01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for taking right
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
now question
 
01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:06.790 align:start position:0%
now question
senator

01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
my question is i'm not clear on the
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
funding here that there is no fiscal
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
analysis and you noted that and that
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
as to why because
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
this will have a fiscal impact so
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
why do we have no analysis on that
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
sure and thank you very much
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative for the questions so
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
recognizing that um this this year and
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
coming into this biennial budget was
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
certainly an
 
01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
unprecedented situation in our state um
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
all we are asking for right now is
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
for this program language simply to be
 
01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:42.630 align:start position:0%
for this program language simply to be
returned

01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
returned
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
to statute so in the future
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
to implement and effectualize the
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
program you're correct we obviously will
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
need to make a budget ask and to provide
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
potentially staff you know to support
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
the program or at least part of an fte
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
but um knowing that there's many other
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
competing priorities this year
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're simply asking for the statutory
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
language to be returned and we can
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the senator
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
about section two
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
there are two hands up mr chair the
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
first representative gilman and the
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
senator perkins cuoco for taking my
 
01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.270 align:start position:0%
senator perkins cuoco for taking my
question

01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
um i have uh my question is about the
 
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
section uh about what's available
 
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh where is it what can be awarded for
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
the matching grants
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
and number four is uh mapping historic
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
structures and buildings within
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
communities mm-hmm um
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
do you are you aware of certified local
 
01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.910 align:start position:0%
do you are you aware of certified local
governments

01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
they're very a program that's managed by
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
the division of historic resources and
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
handles federal grants for doing just
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
so my question my question is can a
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
certified local government
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
go for mapping historic structures
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
with both kinds of grants both a federal
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
and a and
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh state that is an
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
excellent technical question
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%

i forgot i recognized
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative you're up thank
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
you mr chair for taking uh
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
letting me ask the question uh senator
 
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
perkins quaker this is this is more like
 
01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:16.950 align:start position:0%
perkins quaker this is this is more like
an

01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation or the policy
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
correct without the fiscal note so
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
we can deal with the housing crisis and
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
enable the local communities to make
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
that determination
 
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
that's correct representative and thank
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
yes this is very much enabling because
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
it essentially just puts language back
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
into the rsa in the future we can
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
implement the program as mentioned
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
earlier with with budget requests or
 
01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:50.950 align:start position:0%
earlier with with budget requests or
funding

01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
and then once that those steps are taken
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
this is a voluntary program where towns
 
01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
and cities can reach out
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
if they would like assistance with goals
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
that they've identified for themselves
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of housing
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
yeah just to follow up mr chair please
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
so this is more like a opt-in opt-out
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
by the local communities so it is
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
what the local communities can do to
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
address their housing crisis correct
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
very much so representative and there is
 
01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:24.870 align:start position:0%
very much so representative and there is
um

01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
language in here in multiple places that
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
references the voluntary nature of this
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
program and that
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
it's completely optional if
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.470 align:start position:0%
 
not

01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh next will be mr frost
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this is ben frost

and i'll speak just to address
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative gilman's question
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
initially and i can proceed with further
 
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
testimony if you wish but
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative gilman you asked about
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
certified local governments
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
and whether a municipality would be able
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
to use
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
the federal grants to do similar work to
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
what is enabled in
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
the housing and conservation planning
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
program with regard to historic
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
resources and i think the answer is yes
 
01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
although i would say that the in all
 
01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.149 align:start position:0%
although i would say that the in all
likelihood

01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
likelihood
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
a municipality that is a certified local
 
01:16:29.199 --> 01:16:29.750 align:start position:0%
a municipality that is a certified local
government

01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
probably already would have done that
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
work that is
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
envisioned in that particular section of
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
the housing and conservation planning
 
01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:38.790 align:start position:0%
the housing and conservation planning
program

01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
but if there were funds available for a
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
community to
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
become a certified local government
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
for purposes of historic resources
 
01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:49.990 align:start position:0%
for purposes of historic resources
preservation

01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
preservation
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
then they certainly should be able to
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
use both the state and
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
you uh senator perkins coca for
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh concerning my question uh
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
i have a question about uh there's a
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
there's a provision for multiple
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
embarking on uh this type of uh program
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
what would happen if uh after
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
phase two that uh uh one or more of the
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities decided that uh they were
 
01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:38.790 align:start position:0%
municipalities decided that uh they were
not

01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh going to pursue uh subsequent faces
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
as stated you know this is a completely
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
voluntary program and so it's really
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's just here to help and provide
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
support to municipalities
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
i am again going to ask ben frost to
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
chime in as he's had much more history
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
with the operations of the program but
 
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
um as i understand it i would presume
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
the answer to that to be
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
that the municipalities which wish to
 
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:09.750 align:start position:0%
that the municipalities which wish to
continue

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
would simply submit a new application um
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any anyone else
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to section two or the
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
and healthy communities in new hampshire
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
and throughout new england
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
i'm here to speak in strong support of
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
part two of senate bill 86 creating the
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
housing and conservation
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
planning program we've also submitted
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
written testimony that provides
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
additional background information
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
as mentioned this program would provide
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
technical assistance matching grants to
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities as they strategically
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
develop and implement plans to create
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
much needed housing and preserve open
 
01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.070 align:start position:0%
much needed housing and preserve open
space

01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
space
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
right now high demand and low inventory
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
in both the home buying and rental
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
markets have caused prices
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
to rise beyond the reach of many
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
residents even as household incomes have
 
01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:33.669 align:start position:0%
residents even as household incomes have
risen

01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
risen
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire needs to develop tens of
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
thousands of additional housing units to
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
meet demand
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
the housing and conservation planning
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
program would help alleviate these
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
issues by encouraging municipalities to
 
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
add higher density
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
and workforce housing in an efficient
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
manner balancing development with the
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
protection of natural resources
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
this can create neighborhoods that offer
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
potential access to jobs transportation
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
green space housing stability and
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
economic opportunity
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
the program would also require
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities to engage with
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in the development and
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
planning stages
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
which will help ensure that the policies
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
are equitable and reflect
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
community needs again we strongly
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
support and urge you to vote ought to
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
pass on sb 86 part two
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and i'm happy to
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
seeing gun uh is there anyone else who
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
would like to speak to section
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
two mr chairman this is ben frost i i do

chairman
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
again ben frost from new hampshire
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
housing um i i want to
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
emphasize a couple things and
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative manjapudi
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh pointed out the the state's housing
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
crisis and that that
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
is an important target
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
of this legislation although recognize
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
that the original legislation
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
was at a different time at a time when
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
we were also facing
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
serious housing affordability problems
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
in the state but it should not be lost
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
that this is in fact um a a
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that looks at both
 
01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:08.149 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that looks at both
housing

01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
and conservation uh so this is in
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
an attempt to get communities
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
that want to participate in this
 
01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:17.990 align:start position:0%
that want to participate in this
voluntarily

01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
voluntarily
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
to look at the same time at their
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
housing issues
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
and their natural resource conservation
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
issues and their historic
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
resource preservation issues and in fact
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
the design of it that they they can't
 
01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.189 align:start position:0%
the design of it that they they can't
choose

01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
choose
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
one or the other we're just going to
 
01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
look at housing we're just going to look
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
at natural resource preservation
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
under the the precepts of this program
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
as it is organized and designed
 
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
and conceived municipalities need to do
 
01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:44.870 align:start position:0%
and conceived municipalities need to do
both

01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
at the same time we recognize that
 
01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
you know there are really important
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
conservation concerns
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
ranging from wildlife habitat to
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
subsurface water
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
quality that are threatened
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
frankly by certain types of development
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
and the the what is being encouraged
 
01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:05.110 align:start position:0%
and the the what is being encouraged
here

01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
is a a type of development
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
that will at the same time help us meet
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
our housing objectives but also to
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
conserve important natural resources
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
again strictly voluntary and
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
and strongly encourage the committee's
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
consideration of this legislation
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to take any questions any
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%

questions for mr
trump

01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
seeing that is there anyone from the
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
public that would ask like to ask
 
01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:38.310 align:start position:0%
public that would ask like to ask
questions

01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%

the second
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
was tom jerosa from the
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
housing action here both it i believe
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
both for section two
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
okay uh miss holland would you like to
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you um so my name is
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
sarah holland i am
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
the broker and owner of sarah holland
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
and company a real estate firm in
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
plymouth and i'm also the vice chair
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
of the public policy committee at the
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association of realtors
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
um we're here to support all three
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
sections of senate bill 86 but specific
 
01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:24.070 align:start position:0%
sections of senate bill 86 but specific
to

01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
section two we definitely echo mr frost
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
um land in new hampshire is finite and
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
we need to have a better understanding
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
of how it is being utilized
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
it is enabling legislation so it doesn't
 
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
mandate a community to do
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
anything hopefully it will eventually
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
provide the resources to our
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities to protect our natural
 
01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:44.950 align:start position:0%
municipalities to protect our natural
resources

01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
while ensuring more housing options for
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
our residents
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
um and decisions made this is an
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
important point that
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
decisions made in one community have
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
consequences in neighboring communities
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
so this may be a way for us to better
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
understand those impacts
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you and that those are all our
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%

communications and engagement manager of
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
housing action new hampshire we are a
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
statewide coalition of 80 organizations
 
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
united around affordable housing policy
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
we're in support of sb 86 part 2
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
established in the new hampshire housing
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
conservation planning program
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
it won't add much to what has already
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
been said other than to say that we are
 
01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.709 align:start position:0%
been said other than to say that we are
aware

01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
aware
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
and this committee's aware of the
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
affordable housing crisis that this
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
state faces
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
as has been noted this is just another
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
tool in the toolbox that we can work to
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
give communities
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
that they can use to address this
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
shortage um and then
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
again you know as we know it's unfunded
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh for now but
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
it will remind municipalities that
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
increasing affordable housing does not
 
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:30.629 align:start position:0%
increasing affordable housing does not
mean

01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
compromising our beautiful natural
 
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
landscape or rural character
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
the support and technical assistance for
 
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
the comprehensive approach can help
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
increase our housing needs while
 
01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
balancing all the other interests uh
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
similar to what mr frost had already
 
01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.910 align:start position:0%
similar to what mr frost had already
mentioned

01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
so just in conclusion we we would say
 
01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
that that this advisory group is simply
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
advisory and the real opportunity lies
 
01:25:52.639 --> 01:25:53.189 align:start position:0%
advisory and the real opportunity lies
with

01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are interested in
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
providing housing for its residents
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
while balancing the importance of
 
01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.510 align:start position:0%
while balancing the importance of
conservation

01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
conservation

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
greatest assets
 
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
many of our communities have that is the
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
existing built
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that is historically
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
present and where the commercial centers
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
of our communities
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
indeed these are oftentimes great
 
01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:55.189 align:start position:0%
indeed these are oftentimes great
opportunities

01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
for redevelopment not for commercial
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
purposes but for residential purposes
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
and we've seen this across the state uh
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
from one community to the next a lot of
 
01:28:04.719 --> 01:28:04.950 align:start position:0%
from one community to the next a lot of
this

01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
is happening in places like manchester
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
and nashua
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
dover and and these often times are done
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh in a way that's you know is really
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
sensitive to the their surroundings
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
and if you look at in particular i'll
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
call it in
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
one project in particular in nashua um
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
john stabile uh redid the the cotton
 
01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
john stabile uh redid the the cotton
mill

01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
mill
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
which was a derelict building in a
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
really down and out section of the city
 
01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:35.350 align:start position:0%
really down and out section of the city
and

01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
when when he took on that project and it
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
was a multi-year
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
project for him one of the largest
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
projects he's engaged in
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
it served as an anchor for redevelopment
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
of that portion of the city of nashua
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
and is providing a significant number of
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
both market rate rental units and uh
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
affordable subsidized uh units for
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
people who
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
are of lower income these are great
 
01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:02.629 align:start position:0%
are of lower income these are great
opportunities

01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh for for redevelopment and in a way
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's you know
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
consistent with uh the history of our
 
01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.950 align:start position:0%
consistent with uh the history of our
communities

01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr frost any other questions
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question now i
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
have a question for uh
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
ben frost uh in phase two
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
this is going to be the development of a
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
growth and development
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh strategy now who exactly would be on
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
the board
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
or organization that's doing this do you
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
have any uh
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh thoughts on this thank you for that
 
01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:45.030 align:start position:0%
uh thoughts on this thank you for that
question

01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative trippy uh the strategies
 
01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
are to be developed by the
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities themselves
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
so if a municipality wants to engage in
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
this work
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
they they would um essentially apply to
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
well if now it's the office of strategic
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
initiatives but
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
recognizing that the current budget
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
as it is presently in the senate would
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
move the planning division over to the
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
department of business and economic
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
affairs and this program would follow
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
i presume the planning division there so
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know assuming uh if
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature in a future year chooses
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
to appropriate money to do this
 
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh then a municipality would apply to do
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
apply to for funding to do so they would
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
provide their own matching funds
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
and then they would hire a consultant to
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
help them so it's really
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
the consultant working for the
 
01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:41.270 align:start position:0%
the consultant working for the
municipality

01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh that is engaged in this work so the
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
municipality is driving this whether it
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
local board of selectmen or the planning
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
board or some committee that's assembled
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
by the municipality this is
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
a municipally focused and municipally
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
driven uh
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
program thank you
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
if there are no more questions i'm going
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%

plaistow and pelham this morning i am
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
pleased to introduce part three of
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill 86
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
this is relative to prohibiting the
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
installation of certain commercially
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
available heating systems and engaging
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
the services of certain energy providers
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
the bill is straightforward and very
 
01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:04.390 align:start position:0%
the bill is straightforward and very
pro-consumer

01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
pro-consumer
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
it supports citizens being able to
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
choose how they want to heat their homes
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
and their businesses
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
it prevents any political subdivision of
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
or any local land use board from
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
adopting any measures that prohibit or
 
01:32:18.159 --> 01:32:19.270 align:start position:0%
adopting any measures that prohibit or
restrict

01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
restrict
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
a person or a business's choice when it
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
comes to their heating system or their
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
energy providers
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens should have the
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
right to choose any reliable energy
 
01:32:30.239 --> 01:32:30.870 align:start position:0%
right to choose any reliable energy
system

01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
that best suits their needs whether it's
 
01:32:33.199 --> 01:32:34.070 align:start position:0%
that best suits their needs whether it's
gas

01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
gas
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
electricity solar geothermal
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
oil or any other source i know there are
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
a few folks wishing to testify
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
that can get into the details so i think
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
most of your questions about this bill
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
would be best answered by them but i
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
would still
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions the
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
committee has
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
any questions for the president of the
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
senate yes senator
 
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair and
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you senator morris
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
um is there
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
has there been a history of um
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
communities prohibiting
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
people from installing the heating
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
system of their choice in the state
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
that i'm that you're aware of no and i
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
think that's what you'll hear testimony
 
01:33:24.719 --> 01:33:25.510 align:start position:0%
think that's what you'll hear testimony
after

01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
myself that we uh we basically want to
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
make sure that that doesn't happen i
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
mean if you just think about
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
um your local oil or propane deal is the
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
investments that they have
 
01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
into their companies i think they're
 
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
nervous and they
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
certainly uh looked out to us to try and
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
put in legislation
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
so that they you know they could make
 
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
investments comfortably
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
in vehicles and plants and everything
 
01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:52.229 align:start position:0%
in vehicles and plants and everything
else

01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
to uh you know keep their businesses
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
going forever
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you senator
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
um this is sort of related but a little
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
bit unrelated
 
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering about i've lived in three
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
four different houses that i've my
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
family has installed a wood stove
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
into and the source of my
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
heating would be the man who cut the
 
01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:21.189 align:start position:0%
heating would be the man who cut the
lumber

01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
lumber
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
the timber and delivered the boards of
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
wood to my home
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
are those kinds of things covered
 
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
is that considered a safe i'm i'm just i
 
01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
guess i'm curious about what
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
what would be prevented from being
 
01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.950 align:start position:0%
what would be prevented from being
prohibited

01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think what we're trying to do
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
and i don't know that it directly
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
speaks to wood but um it basically is
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
letting you make that choice
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
and the uh i'm certain when it comes to
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
wood in the state of new hampshire
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
being used as a heating source um we
 
01:34:59.669 --> 01:34:59.679 align:start position:0%
we would want to protect that in new
 
01:34:59.679 --> 01:35:04.229 align:start position:0%
we would want to protect that in new
hampshire

01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
yeah um so since we discussed
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
um the whole germanis question with
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
um senate bill 84 i kind of want to
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
bring that up again here
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
um i i mean i can see the connection
 
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
between the first two parts pretty
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
easily since they're both about
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
planning boards um or
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
about planning and housing and
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
construction that sort of stuff but and
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
seems more about energy policy and um
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if you could draw the
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
connection a bit more clearly for me
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
well i mean to be honest with you the
 
01:35:53.109 --> 01:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
whole bill now
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
is jermaine coming out of the senate so
 
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
the reality of the house looking at it
 
01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:00.070 align:start position:0%
the reality of the house looking at it
there's

01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
several subject matters in here that um
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
you know would cover your germain this
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
rules um
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
if the speaker thought any different i'm
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
sure he'd let me know
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
but um i think the omnibus bills are
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
difficult for the house and difficult
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
for the senate
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
and um we uh if all the legislators had
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
listened and
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
only dealt with bills that dealt with
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
covet or dealt with the budget
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
um i don't think we'd be doing these
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
omnibus bills because they're difficult
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
for the senate too
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
but the reality of it being um related
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
this whole bill is a bill and that's how
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
it was sent
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
over to the house so i think it's it's
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
senator morris
 
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
representative we have anybody in cube
 
01:36:52.719 --> 01:36:53.669 align:start position:0%
representative we have anybody in cube
no

01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
no no mr chair all right i thought i
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
just saw a hand walk in the room
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
yes for him thank you mr
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
senator moore said would it be fair to
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
say that
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about this before on
 
01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
a personal basis built somebody building
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
a home
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
but wouldn't that wouldn't this bill in
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
fact uh
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
protect uh any builders uh
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
who were putting in a commercial uh
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
facility or commercial uh project
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
so that they also would be protected
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
and would help us in the long term
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
protect our developers
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
providing jobs for the state
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
well it specifically says businesses
 
01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
have choices too
 
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
in the legislation but the um i think
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
the reality of it is
 
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
um you know as technology changes and
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
and people are making new construction
 
01:37:54.239 --> 01:37:54.950 align:start position:0%
and people are making new construction
um

01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
they're gonna look to different areas
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
but um we still
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
have a whole state that operated
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
operates on
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
things like propane and oil and we
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
certainly have a lot of local neighbors
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
that own businesses
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
and and we just don't want to see them
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
zoned out in new hampshire
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
and that's why we wrote this legislation
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
a question from representative davis for
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
the senator
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and um thank you for
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
um this is just a wording thing but on
 
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
the last on page six
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
paragraphs five b and six appear to be
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
can you explain am i just missing
 
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
something or
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
i think she's on line one on page six
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at sections 5b and
 
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
section 6 on page 6.
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
i think it's because it's addressing two
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
parts of the law
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
um and i think the people speaking after
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
me can speak to that but it looks like
 
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's addressing um from the page before
 
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
one section um rsa 155 and then
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
in two it looks like it's addressing rsa
 
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
674 so that's probably why it's repeated
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you man and uh
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
corel johnson did you have a comment on
 
01:39:31.679 --> 01:39:33.350 align:start position:0%
corel johnson did you have a comment on
that

01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh thank you mr chairman cordell
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
johnston representing the new hampshire
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
municipal association
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
um and just uh on that last question
 
01:39:49.590 --> 01:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
yes uh that's correct uh
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
one of those paragraphs is
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
making an amendment to the building code
 
01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:55.990 align:start position:0%
making an amendment to the building code
uh

01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
statute and the other is making a
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
parallel amendment to the
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
we generally get nervous when whenever
 
01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
an attempt to uh restrict local
 
01:40:11.679 --> 01:40:12.870 align:start position:0%
an attempt to uh restrict local
authority

01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh over over zoning matters
 
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
um but as far as i know
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
as indicated no municipality has
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
has expressed any interest
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
in enacting these kinds of restrictions
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure
 
01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
that there is a significant concern
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
from the um from the municipal
 
01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:39.430 align:start position:0%
from the um from the municipal
association

01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
i think you may hear concerns uh from
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%

other

01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative thank you mr chair
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr johnson for taking
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
this question i'm just curious is
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
under our municipalities currently
 
01:41:04.239 --> 01:41:05.030 align:start position:0%
under our municipalities currently
allowed

01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
to make these kind of restrictions and i
 
01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
know that they can't do anything
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
that we unless we let them
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
under our current statutes are they
 
01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
restrict this and
 
01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
something like this i yeah i i think
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
theoretically they could
 
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
as i say i i don't uh believe any
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
municipality has but
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
theoretically they could okay thank you
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
are there
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
any other questions and sections for yes
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%

the language in this bill specifically
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
refers to heating or other energy
 
01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
systems could you please clarify what
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
energy systems
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
are and i would like to know if that
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
encompasses cooking such as
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
mr chairman this is senator morris the
 
01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:08.390 align:start position:0%

thank you uh yes uh representative power
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
to answer your question
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
um certainly it would include hvac
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i would think that it would include
 
01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.109 align:start position:0%
and i would think that it would include
uh

01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
cooking as well uh i'm i guess i'm not
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
sure whether that's the intent
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh i wasn't involved in drafting it but
 
01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:36.149 align:start position:0%
uh i wasn't involved in drafting it but
i

01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh i i would read it as including
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you i believe also includes
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%

uh william mckinney who signed up to
 
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
speak on
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
this final section why don't we start
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
off with representative matthew fuji
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr cordell
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
johnson for taking my question would
 
01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:30.709 align:start position:0%
johnson for taking my question would
this

01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
be creating micromanagement
 
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
for the local municipalities or taking
 
01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:38.310 align:start position:0%
for the local municipalities or taking
away

01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
local control if you're going down to
 
01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
cooking and gas grills
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
to you know grilling in the backyard
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
we're gonna regulate isn't that
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
is it am i seeing it too
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
um broadly or is
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
is that the way it reads
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
um it cert it certainly is taking
 
01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
authority away
 
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh and whether i i guess whether you
 
01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
consider it micromanaging
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
is um is a matter of perspective
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh we we we do like to avoid
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
state micromanagement of
 
01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
of local government a few years ago
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
the legislature put in something that
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
said you can't require
 
01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
sprinklers in that municipalities can't
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
require sprinklers
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
in certain buildings uh and so
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know when the legislature finds
 
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
something that it doesn't want
 
01:44:44.229 --> 01:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities to regulate
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
um it uh it does it
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
and as i said we try to we try to avoid
 
01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:50.950 align:start position:0%
and as i said we try to we try to avoid
that

01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
um i guess it's really a judgment call
 
01:44:55.590 --> 01:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
for you whether this is a policy that
 
01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
you think is
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative gallagher you're up
 
01:45:02.239 --> 01:45:06.550 align:start position:0%
yes representative gallagher you're up
next

01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh i i believe um representative fan was
 
01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
up next but
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
i guess since i'm speaking i'll um do my
 
01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:14.470 align:start position:0%
i guess since i'm speaking i'll um do my
question

01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
anyways um so yeah for mr
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
johnson so you said that um since
 
01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
no municipalities currently
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
implement such a regulation that
 
01:45:27.679 --> 01:45:29.189 align:start position:0%
implement such a regulation that
therefore

01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
no the municipalities don't have any
 
01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
sorts of
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
concerns about this legislation but
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
put another way couldn't the fact that
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
um no municipalities implement such
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
regulation also mean
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that certainly is uh you
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
certainly could
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
certainly could look at it that way and
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
just to be clear we're
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
we i i'm not here supporting uh section
 
01:46:02.719 --> 01:46:03.590 align:start position:0%
we i i'm not here supporting uh section
three

01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
um i i expressed mild concerns about it
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
in the senate but they went
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
but they they did pass it uh and
 
01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not here begging you not not to
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
adopt section 3 either
 
01:46:19.590 --> 01:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
just kind of providing information but
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
yeah you're right um
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
if if no one's doing it you could
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
interpret that to mean
 
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
that that it's not necessary
 
01:46:29.199 --> 01:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
that that it's not necessary
representative

01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:30.290 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:46:30.290 --> 01:46:33.590 align:start position:0%
representative
[Music]

01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you mr
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
johnson okay so apparently i have this
 
01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:39.109 align:start position:0%
johnson okay so apparently i have this
backwards

01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
backwards
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
i understood that this bill said that
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
towns cannot enact um an ordinance
 
01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:47.030 align:start position:0%
towns cannot enact um an ordinance
saying

01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
you can't have uh any a particular kind
 
01:46:51.189 --> 01:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
of heating
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
is that in fact what it does say
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
are we trying to stop them from doing a
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
thing or are we trying to make them do a
 
01:46:59.199 --> 01:47:00.390 align:start position:0%
thing or are we trying to make them do a
thing

01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
i think i think you're you're trying to
 
01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:03.590 align:start position:0%
i think i think you're you're trying to
stop

01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
stop
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
them from stopping others
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
so i am correct so am i correct
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
that really the basis of this bill is
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
to prevent an area a jurisdiction we'll
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
call it
 
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
from enacting an ordinance that
 
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:22.790 align:start position:0%
from enacting an ordinance that
prohibits

01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
prohibits
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
burning fossil fuels for heating
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
is that what we're doing yes if the town
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
of peterborough
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
say adopted an ordinance uh saying that
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
all new construction
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
must be heated by solar uh
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
wind uh geothermal and and
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
cannot use fossil fuels this would
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
this would that's what this bill is
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
stop that would say you you can't impose
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
that regulation
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much i now know what
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
i think i actually think local
 
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions should be able to do that
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
if we're serious about climate change
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for making that clear
 
01:48:04.229 --> 01:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
to me you're welcome uh
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
and we had remember the public uh center
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh we have mr william

01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
mr mckinney you're uh yes good morning
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%

the committee
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
i am william mccain before you get too
 
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
deep into this you had
 
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
asked for a budget of 10 minutes to give
 
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
your remarks i'm going to ask you
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
to ratchet that down to two to three
 
01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:36.629 align:start position:0%
to ratchet that down to two to three
minutes

01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
understood i will do so
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm william mckinney i'm the
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%

officials association
 
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
if you're not familiar with our
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
association we are
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
a professional organization with members
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%

01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%

01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
provide training
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
to all of those members
 
01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
and to keep up to date on state law and
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
the statutes that affect the
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
construction industry
 
01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
our primary concern with part three
 
01:49:22.890 --> 01:49:22.900 align:start position:0%
of this bill is that it amends
 
01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:24.149 align:start position:0%
of this bill is that it amends

rsa155a2 which is
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
the state building code um our
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
biggest concern with this is not that we
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
object to the language
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
is that we don't see anywhere on here
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
that the building code review
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
board established under rsa 155 a10

[Music]

01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
aware of this amendment
 
01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
being that we have some strong concerns
 
01:50:01.109 --> 01:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
that this amendment could possibly
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
create some conflicts
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh to the current state building code
 
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
specifically the international
 
01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
building code the international
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
residential code and the international
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
mechanical code all of those govern
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
heating systems in any of our buildings
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
i will state that i think the building
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
code review board has done an excellent
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
job in the years
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
of trying to keep up to date with
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
newer technologies in to be specific
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
um most recently they adopted amendments
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
me 15 13 18 and me 15 14
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
18 which both allow for
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
systems that you would find meeting
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
european standards
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
provided that they have some
 
01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
additions to that they have to provide
 
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
all of their data and data labels in
 
01:50:50.719 --> 01:50:51.430 align:start position:0%
all of their data and data labels in
english

01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
english
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
and they have to have fittings that
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
comply with north american standards
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
but they've also gone through to amend
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
the mechanical code to recognize
 
01:51:03.589 --> 01:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
biomass fuels as well so i really feel
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
that rather than having language like
 
01:51:06.149 --> 01:51:06.159 align:start position:0%
this in
 
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that it should be through
 
01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:10.070 align:start position:0%
legislation that it should be through
amendment

01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
by the building code review board um
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
that would adopt
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
and allow for any of those systems in
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
there i do understand the concerns
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
of you know local locality or local
 
01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:22.149 align:start position:0%
of you know local locality or local
communities

01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
restricting certain heating fuels and um
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
we certainly would not like to see that
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
we certainly want to see you know our
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
efforts put to more energy efficient and
 
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
more greener energies
 
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
but we have to recognize that you know
 
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
those are those fuels are out there
 
01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
and technology has come a long way to
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
make those more economical
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
um and with that i would just summarize
 
01:51:45.599 --> 01:51:46.550 align:start position:0%
um and with that i would just summarize
that

01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
our significant issue with part three
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
is that it has not had the input from
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
the building code review board
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
that is a board that was appointed by
 
01:51:58.229 --> 01:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
to review and recommend any amendments
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
to the state building code
 
01:52:04.149 --> 01:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
and we believe they should have input on
 
01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i will entertain
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%

01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
popped up so i haven't looked to see if
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
they are on our list of where they may
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
be from
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
no i don't see either one of them on our
 
01:52:48.149 --> 01:52:48.159 align:start position:0%

01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire in our industry
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
supplying clean reliable energy to over

7 500 residential homes
 
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking in support of part
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
three which deals specifically with
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
consumer choice as it pertains to how
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
consumers decide to heat their homes
 
01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh nothing in this bill would prohibit
 
01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
the state fire marshal or the mechanical
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
boards from regulating
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
any of the fuels as they currently are
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're safe to make
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
sure that they're clean
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
this would just allow individual
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
consumers to decide which energy they
 
01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:29.430 align:start position:0%
consumers to decide which energy they
choose

01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
choose
 
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
to heat their home they would still have
 
01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719 align:start position:0%
to do so in accordance
 
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
with the state rules that are governed
 
01:54:36.070 --> 01:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
01:54:38.950 --> 01:54:38.960 align:start position:0%

environmentalist
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
i have a master's degree in
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
environmental management i'm an attorney
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
and i have worked as the bureau director
 
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
for the maine department of
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
environmental management
 
01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
and as an environmentalist i am very
 
01:54:53.589 --> 01:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
troubled by the electrify everything
 
01:54:55.589 --> 01:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
movement that is gaining momentum across
 
01:54:56.709 --> 01:54:56.719 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm deeply concerned about the lack
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
of energy diversity and energy security
 
01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
that's inherent in this electricity only
 
01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:05.510 align:start position:0%
that's inherent in this electricity only
scheme

01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
scheme
 
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
propane is unfortunately lumped into
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels and given a bad
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
wrap we are a beneficial byproduct
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's left over
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
there is more propane produced than is
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
used every year
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
if you don't use propane to offset an
 
01:55:21.189 --> 01:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
energy source it's simply burned off
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
so if you believe in reduce reuse
 
01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
recycling you should be promoting
 
01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
propane as an energy source
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
rather than just having it burned
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily and not used
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
and here in new hampshire natural gas
 
01:55:34.629 --> 01:55:34.639 align:start position:0%
supplies 19
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
of our electricity each year and propane
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
is a byproduct of natural gas
 
01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to be good
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
environmental stewards and reduce
 
01:55:46.229 --> 01:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
our environmental footprints we should
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
be promoting propane
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
propane is also the unsung hero of
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events
 
01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
if climate change is increasing and the
 
01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
likelihood of these prevents is
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
predicted to increase we need to make
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%

we were the primary energy source used
 
01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
for heat outdoor testing sites
 
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:16.000 align:start position:0%

the homeless in new hampshire as well as
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
a sort of

of outdoor heating for businesses
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
including numerous restaurants who are
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
using propane today so they can have
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
customers eat outside
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
and for all the testing sites that were
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
set up outside of hospitals throughout
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
our industry is very concerned about the
 
01:56:49.109 --> 01:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
environment and we're actively working
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
to reduce carbon emissions
 
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
we've reduced millions of tons of carbon
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
emissions each year across the globe
 
01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
by being used to offset the world's
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
greatest health threat
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
which is indoor air pollution caused by
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
burning wood and cooking and heating
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
in many of the countries across the
 
01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
globe over 3.5 million people each year
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
die from indoor air pollution and
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
burning wood
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
also leads to just deforestation and
 
01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
alarming rate
 
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
in developing countries and it causes
 
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
enormous carbon dioxide emissions
 
01:57:24.629 --> 01:57:24.639 align:start position:0%
moving one family from wood to propane
 
01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
saves over a ton
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
of carbon dioxide a year and when we
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
move 50 families
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
in parts along the equator from wood to
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
propane we save an acre of rainforest
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
land which is so
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
important for the ecological and the
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
climate benefits that it has
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
so i do believe that environmental
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
environments should really look at
 
01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
propane as part of the solution in new
 
01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:49.830 align:start position:0%
propane as part of the solution in new
hampshire

01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
and i also think that citizens deserve
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
the right to use their own clean energy
 
01:57:54.239 --> 01:57:54.870 align:start position:0%
the right to use their own clean energy
source

01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
and depict what they want to use this
 
01:57:59.189 --> 01:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
does not prohibit anyone from putting
 
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
solar panels
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
or electric heat pumps into their houses
 
01:58:04.629 --> 01:58:04.639 align:start position:0%
if they want to but it also allows them
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
to have clean warm air furnaces for
 
01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:08.629 align:start position:0%
to have clean warm air furnaces for
propane

01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
propane
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
that would provide clean heating for
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
them or other fuels
 
01:58:14.229 --> 01:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
you know if they choose to to burn wood
 
01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
or to burn
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
other things that are approved and
 
01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
allowed for
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
use through the new hampshire agencies
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
that regulate them
 
01:58:24.070 --> 01:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
so i ask for your support for part three
 
01:58:25.669 --> 01:58:25.679 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
that you have

01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
customers depend on us
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
on propane for many things including hot
 
01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
showers heating their homes
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
drying their laundry cooking hot meals
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
and running their generators when
 
01:59:32.229 --> 01:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
there's no power
 
01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
if this bill does not pass and local
 
01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:36.639 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions put restrictions
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
on what consumers can only choose for
 
01:59:40.950 --> 01:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
their energy source
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
and thus eliminating propane which is a
 
01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
staple in our community
 
01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719 align:start position:0%
it would be a cause it would be costly
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
for consumers to have to convert
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
their existing systems installed in
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
their homes or businesses
 
01:59:55.109 --> 01:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
it takes away the consumer's choice and
 
01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
ultimately will increase the cost of
 
01:59:56.719 --> 01:59:57.510 align:start position:0%
ultimately will increase the cost of
energy

01:59:57.510 --> 01:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:00:00.310 --> 02:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
because of less competition the impact
 
02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
us personally for as an employer
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
would be a loss of over a hundred jobs
 
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
which ultimately affects entire families
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
that make a good
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
living here in the state and many homes
 
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
and essential businesses would be in the
 
02:00:14.550 --> 02:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
dark during storms
 
02:00:16.709 --> 02:00:16.719 align:start position:0%
whether it's a winter storm a hurricane
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
or any other
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
this would put essential personnel in
 
02:00:21.189 --> 02:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
harm's way including those
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
including those that need to be on life
 
02:00:23.599 --> 02:00:24.229 align:start position:0%
including those that need to be on life
support

02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals and municipalities including
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
police and fire buildings that rely on
 
02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:30.709 align:start position:0%
police and fire buildings that rely on
power

02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
power
 
02:00:32.709 --> 02:00:32.719 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons i would like to ask
 
02:00:33.910 --> 02:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
for your support in
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
of part three of senate bill 86 so we
 
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
can give consumers the right to choose
 
02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
whatever energy source they want for
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
their family and i thank you for your
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
time this morning
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr any questions for mr irma
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
from farmer
 
02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
saying that let's upload my richard
 
02:00:52.830 --> 02:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
tripp representative tripp do you have a
 
02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:54.470 align:start position:0%
tripp representative tripp do you have a
question

02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:00:56.709 --> 02:00:56.719 align:start position:0%
let me unmute so that i can you can be
 
02:00:58.149 --> 02:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
heard i can be heard
 
02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh mr palmer mr ermer yes uh
 
02:01:04.229 --> 02:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
do you think that uh uh a local
 
02:01:04.239 --> 02:01:05.350 align:start position:0%
do you think that uh uh a local
municipality

02:01:05.350 --> 02:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh restricting uh
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
energy systems to electricity only would
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
would increase the the cost of housing
 
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
and and heating
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i do especially if they
 
02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
have to retrofit
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
um and you know it's changing out in
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
complete systems
 
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
so yes i have a second question
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
sure okay uh
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
what effect do you think uh restricting
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
energy systems on uh housing development
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
would be in new hampshire
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
um so i would have to defer that your
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
question to leslie anderson who just
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
recently spoke
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh mr anderson are you still on the line
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
i am on the line could you just repeat
 
02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
that portion of the question
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh what do you think the effect on uh
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
housing development particularly uh
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
workforce housing
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh would restricting energy systems
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
uh in towns and cities have
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
well i can give you an example you know
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
there's been several
 
02:02:22.149 --> 02:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
um housing developments and and
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings in vermont that have
 
02:02:24.159 --> 02:02:24.470 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings in vermont that have
gone

02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
gone
 
02:02:26.709 --> 02:02:26.719 align:start position:0%
in and they have gone in and been
 
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
required to have electricity only
 
02:02:31.830 --> 02:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
and um some of these buildings have not
 
02:02:34.070 --> 02:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
heated up above 50 degrees in the winter
 
02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:34.550 align:start position:0%
heated up above 50 degrees in the winter
time

02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:02:36.550 --> 02:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
with the heat pump technology that's out
 
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
there and
 
02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
it it heat pumps you know are great for
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
the shoulder months but when you get
 
02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:42.229 align:start position:0%
the shoulder months but when you get
into

02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
temperatures below 20 degrees they do
 
02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%
not really heat the houses the way that
 
02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
you need them to
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
and propane provides an affordable
 
02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:50.870 align:start position:0%
and propane provides an affordable
alternative

02:02:50.870 --> 02:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh during our cold months that allows
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
poor people to to be able to heat more
 
02:02:56.800 --> 02:02:57.830 align:start position:0%
poor people to to be able to heat more
efficiently

02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
and with less of a carbon impact when
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
it's very cold than you would with
 
02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:03.510 align:start position:0%
it's very cold than you would with
electricity

02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
because electricity loses a lot of
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
energy in its transportation and when it
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
gets really cold
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
all of the electricity has in that's
 
02:03:13.510 --> 02:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
made in new england has to switch over
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
to oil
 
02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
or to coal because natural gas that's
 
02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
used for it is not available
 
02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
it goes to the consumers in residential
 
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
locations when we have big energy demand
 
02:03:25.830 --> 02:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
so in the coldest parts of the months if
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
you're heating with just electricity
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
you're really
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
being fueled by oil most of that time
 
02:03:32.950 --> 02:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
so from an environmental justice
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
standpoint i think it's more
 
02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
economical and to the benefit of those
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
people who
 
02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
are not as advantaged as others to be
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
have a diversity in their energy sources
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
to keep their costs low
 
02:03:48.460 --> 02:03:48.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr shaggy are you
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:50.229 align:start position:0%
thank you mr shaggy are you

[Music]
 
02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
available to make a comment
 
02:03:56.790 --> 02:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
i am chairman uh can you hear me
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
yes so right ahead okay uh first i'd
 
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
like to thank you for allowing me to
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
speak uh
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
in regards to senate bill 86 and in
 
02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:05.669 align:start position:0%
in regards to senate bill 86 and in
particular

02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
my support of part three i have
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
submitted some written testimonies so
 
02:04:12.069 --> 02:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm going to take a very short
 
02:04:13.109 --> 02:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
period of time to
 
02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
help you with your time crunch here but
 
02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
i i do want to reiterate that
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
you know this this movement to
 
02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:20.550 align:start position:0%
you know this this movement to
electrical

02:04:20.550 --> 02:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
electrical
 
02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh heat source is uh is
 
02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
really leading us down a very bad path
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
um just go back to 2008 ice storm in new
 
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:32.950 align:start position:0%
um just go back to 2008 ice storm in new
hampshire

02:04:32.950 --> 02:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
when uh for over 434 000 homes were
 
02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.030 align:start position:0%
when uh for over 434 000 homes were
without

02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
electricity for up to 13 days according
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
to the puc
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
if those are all electrically heated
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
homes i think you'd have a lot of
 
02:04:45.199 --> 02:04:46.870 align:start position:0%
homes i think you'd have a lot of
constituents

02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
dying and very unhappy with ones that
 
02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
that survive it
 
02:04:55.109 --> 02:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
propane's a great alternative it's also
 
02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
one of the products that is considered
 
02:04:59.830 --> 02:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
an alternative fuel under the u.s
 
02:05:01.750 --> 02:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
environmental protection agency's clean
 
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
air act
 
02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679 align:start position:0%
and freedom of choice you know being
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
born and raised in the state of new
 
02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:07.910 align:start position:0%
born and raised in the state of new
hampshire

02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
i know freedom of choice isn't just the
 
02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
american way but in new hampshire it's
 
02:05:11.599 --> 02:05:11.990 align:start position:0%
american way but in new hampshire it's
the

02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
where it's it's through and through the
 
02:05:16.149 --> 02:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh the american way
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
they do not want to be told what they
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
can do or when they can do it
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
and we have had a lot of problems with
 
02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
heat pump technology
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
as uh was brought up by ms anderson
 
02:05:30.310 --> 02:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
in not just vermont but maine and and in
 
02:05:31.589 --> 02:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire where
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
when it gets extremely cold which we do
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
get up here
 
02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
they will not heat homes to a
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable level
 
02:05:41.109 --> 02:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
um so i for those reasons
 
02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
and other reasons such as the
 
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
availability of it in emergency
 
02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
where it's being used continuously
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
when electricity fails
 
02:05:54.629 --> 02:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
we cannot be banning products and
 
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
providing a secure
 
02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
safe environment for the residents of
 
02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
so i would hope that you would support
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
sb 86.
 
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh any other members of the
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
public uh
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
mr grower or mr jackson
 
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
that ms anderson had uh alluded to that
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
you want to testify
 
02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
are either of them online they are mr
 
02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:23.589 align:start position:0%
are either of them online they are mr
grower

02:06:23.589 --> 02:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
grower
 
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
mr growers should be good to go and
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
mr jackson should be available also and
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
then we have
 
02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
three other members of the public mr
 
02:06:36.149 --> 02:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
chair after that okay mr brewer
 
02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
hi chairman dolan good morning to you
 
02:06:38.950 --> 02:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
this is jason brauer can you hear me
 
02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:39.589 align:start position:0%
this is jason brauer can you hear me
okay

02:06:39.589 --> 02:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
yes great well i just want to say very
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
briefly uh thank you very much for the
 
02:06:43.679 --> 02:06:44.149 align:start position:0%
briefly uh thank you very much for the
opportunity

02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
to testify unlike the previous speakers
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not a native new hampshirite
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
i was born in new york i went on to
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
spend about 24 years serving in the navy
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
and then finally settled down here and
 
02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
called new hampshire home now where we
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
both live
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
my wife and i live in goffstown so again
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
thanks very much for the opportunity
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
i'll keep my remarks brief
 
02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
i've submitted a written copy of my
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
testimony for reference uh but i just
 
02:07:06.229 --> 02:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
want to hit a couple of points that
 
02:07:07.109 --> 02:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
haven't been uh
 
02:07:10.069 --> 02:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
been discussed here before so my company
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
i'm the regional director for dead river
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
off dead river company
 
02:07:15.189 --> 02:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh my responsibilities are delivering
 
02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
energy to thousands of our customers and
 
02:07:19.030 --> 02:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
your constituents throughout the state
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
and we also provide service to home
 
02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
heating systems as well
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
so we employ here in the state over 250
 
02:07:26.239 --> 02:07:26.950 align:start position:0%
so we employ here in the state over 250
people

02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
throughout new england we employ just
 
02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
over 1200 and so
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
one of the critical things that like the
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
community consider is that if this
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass
 
02:07:37.589 --> 02:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
one of the side effects could be that
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
you know companies like mine and the
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
others who are testifying today
 
02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
we could just be legislated out of
 
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
existence and so
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
that's bad for our company of course but
 
02:07:48.390 --> 02:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's hundreds of people that we employ
 
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
here and so
 
02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
i just think that as our nation recovers
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
from the from the effects of covet of
 
02:07:54.390 --> 02:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
the coveted pandemic
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
we can't afford to pick which companies
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
should be winners and which should be
 
02:07:58.079 --> 02:07:59.990 align:start position:0%
should be winners and which should be
losers

02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
losers
 
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to very briefly say that
 
02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know certain types of fuels
 
02:08:05.189 --> 02:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh kind of get a bad rap as far as their
 
02:08:05.199 --> 02:08:06.310 align:start position:0%
uh kind of get a bad rap as far as their
cleanliness

02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
cleanliness
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh but we are making strides as an
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
industry and i will also say that we
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
fully support
 
02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh efforts to continually improve our
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
environment uh propane like you've heard
 
02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:16.149 align:start position:0%
environment uh propane like you've heard
about

02:08:16.149 --> 02:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:08:19.109 --> 02:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
is is a very clean fuel but also heating
 
02:08:19.119 --> 02:08:19.669 align:start position:0%
is is a very clean fuel but also heating
oil

02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
oil
 
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
in july 2018 a cleaner heating oil was
 
02:08:23.910 --> 02:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
introduced that effectively eliminated
 
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
sulfur so
 
02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
this ultra low ultra low sulfur heating
 
02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:28.149 align:start position:0%
this ultra low ultra low sulfur heating
oil

02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
oil
 
02:08:29.430 --> 02:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
really reduces emissions in a
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
significant way and it also results in
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
greater heating efficiency
 
02:08:34.709 --> 02:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
and it opens even more options to
 
02:08:37.030 --> 02:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
consumers to install the most advanced
 
02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
ultra efficient equipment when they're
 
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
ready to upgrade and so
 
02:08:42.149 --> 02:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
just as one example i personally did
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
that last week and so i'll be burning
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
significantly less
 
02:08:47.109 --> 02:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
oil to heat my home in the in the
 
02:08:47.119 --> 02:08:48.310 align:start position:0%
oil to heat my home in the in the
wintertime

02:08:48.310 --> 02:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
wintertime
 
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
just by way of comparison today the
 
02:08:52.390 --> 02:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
average homeowner uses about 700 gallons
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
of heating oil annually this is less
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
than half of their usage in the 80s so
 
02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
we're making progress and we're not
 
02:09:00.550 --> 02:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
saying that that it's a perfect solution
 
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
but we are getting better uh also
 
02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:05.599 align:start position:0%
we as a company are taking advantage of
 
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
every opportunity to create a cleaner
 
02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
environment right here in our backyard
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh as we speak my company is pioneering
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
a new uh renewable liquid fuel called
 
02:09:15.189 --> 02:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
ethyl avulinate
 
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
this fuel can be produced from either a
 
02:09:18.310 --> 02:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
woody biomass or just
 
02:09:20.550 --> 02:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
general waste and it's shown significant
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
promise and
 
02:09:23.189 --> 02:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
just to put things in perspective our
 
02:09:25.270 --> 02:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
own employees are testing these fuels in
 
02:09:26.550 --> 02:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
their own homes so
 
02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
we do take this very seriously overall
 
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
as a company we believe that a broad
 
02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
spectrum of energy choices is most
 
02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
beneficial to consumers
 
02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
and we're really reminded of this during
 
02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
these these times of natural disasters
 
02:09:40.229 --> 02:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
like those rolling blackouts in texas
 
02:09:42.390 --> 02:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
and california and we believe that homes
 
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
that have multiple sources of heat and
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
energy are resilient
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
so i'll just close the phrase that that
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
became kind of second nature to us in
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
the military uh we had a very simple
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
saying and that is that one is none and
 
02:09:55.589 --> 02:09:55.599 align:start position:0%
two is one
 
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
so uh resilience resilience
 
02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah one is none and two is one
 
02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
um anyway i respectfully ask for your
 
02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
consideration and support for part three
 
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 86

uh i'm here today speaking in support of
 
02:10:43.109 --> 02:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
part 3 sb 86
 
02:10:44.950 --> 02:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
part 3 of the legislative proposal
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
allows the citizens in new hampshire to
 
02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
have their choice when it comes to
 
02:10:49.589 --> 02:10:49.599 align:start position:0%
heating their home throughout the year
 
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
including the bitter winter temperatures
 
02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
that we sometimes experience in our
 
02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:54.950 align:start position:0%
that we sometimes experience in our
state

02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
as other states around the country pass
 
02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
legislation to mandate that the
 
02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
residents use electric heat pumps to
 
02:11:02.069 --> 02:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
heat their homes they are not taking
 
02:11:03.910 --> 02:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
all the variables into account before
 
02:11:05.669 --> 02:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
making these tough decisions and these
 
02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
policies do not belong in new hampshire
 
02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
electric heat pumps work solely off the
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
power grid
 
02:11:12.550 --> 02:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
it's important to remember that
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
electricity must be generated
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
for it to be consumed we also need to
 
02:11:19.109 --> 02:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
look at energy plans and policies
 
02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
from the cradle to the grave how is the
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
energy generated
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
how is the energy consumed and how
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
efficient was this process
 
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
the epa's energy star program gives
 
02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
propane a source site ratio
 
02:11:34.709 --> 02:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
of 1.01 compared to 2.52 for the
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
electricity for the new england iso grid
 
02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
this means that it takes 2.5 units of
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
electricity to produce and deliver one
 
02:11:42.239 --> 02:11:42.870 align:start position:0%
electricity to produce and deliver one
unit

02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
unit
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
of energy to a home compared to 1.01
 
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
units for propane
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
while we do deliver the well we do
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
believe that electric heat pumps have a
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
place in the energy portfolio of new
 
02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:54.550 align:start position:0%
place in the energy portfolio of new
hampshire

02:11:54.550 --> 02:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
we do not believe it should be a mandate
 
02:11:58.149 --> 02:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
from legislation
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
a combination of different energy
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
sources will be the best and it should
 
02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
remain a decision that is made by the
 
02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:04.709 align:start position:0%
remain a decision that is made by the
consumer

02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like to cite a specific example that
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
we ran into
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
in january of 2019 at harmony homes by
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
the bay an elderly housing facility in
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
durham new hampshire
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
they learned firsthand firsthand of the
 
02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
problems with electric heat pumps being
 
02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
used for a sole
 
02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
heat source here in new hampshire the
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
facility contains around 50 individual
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
assisted living rooms
 
02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
when the building was constructed the
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
engineer had specified that individual
 
02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
electric heat pumps be installed in
 
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
every room to take care of the heating
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
and cooling needs of that room
 
02:12:37.589 --> 02:12:37.599 align:start position:0%
when january hit and the temperatures
 
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
fell the electric heat pumps could no
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
longer support the needs of the elderly
 
02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
residents and they could not get the
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
building above 65 degrees fahrenheit
 
02:12:47.830 --> 02:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
electric heat pumps will run at lower
 
02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
temperatures but they will blow cool air
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
at best and elderly like hot air not
 
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
cool air
 
02:12:54.870 --> 02:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
the elderly residents at this facility
 
02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
were not comfortable
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
and the owner was forced to spend an
 
02:12:59.189 --> 02:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
additional 70 to
 
02:13:02.550 --> 02:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
72 thousand dollars to put individual
 
02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
propane-fired renai heaters in each room
 
02:13:06.149 --> 02:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
to accommodate the needs of its
 
02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
residents of which he later recovered in
 
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
the electric heat pumps will work for
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
the shoulder seasons but should not be
 
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
mandated and the only option for heating
 
02:13:17.350 --> 02:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
homes and businesses within our state
 
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
mandating that new hampshire residents
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
only use electric heat pumps will affect
 
02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
the livelihood of 40 different propane
 
02:13:25.109 --> 02:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
companies that are directly involved in
 
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
their communities within our state
 
02:13:29.350 --> 02:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
most of these businesses are small
 
02:13:31.109 --> 02:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
family-owned businesses
 
02:13:32.709 --> 02:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
with over a hundred locations throughout
 
02:13:34.629 --> 02:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
the state to serve their customers
 
02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
with these small businesses they sustain
 
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
over twenty seven hundred green jobs in
 
02:13:40.709 --> 02:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
the local infrastructure to provide
 
02:13:41.910 --> 02:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
critical energy
 
02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
energy diversity and reduce the demand
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
on our fragile
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
electrical grid it is for these reasons
 
02:13:50.069 --> 02:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
that i ask you to support the passes of
 
02:13:52.629 --> 02:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
part 3 of sb 86 and give our residents
 
02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
the option to choose the energy choice
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
that best fits their needs
 
02:14:02.550 --> 02:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:04.480 align:start position:0%

you you'll pardon me it is a bit of a
 
02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question
 
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
but with all the talk of of um
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
how clean this kind of fuel is
 
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
i can speak for my constituents in

what is the propane industry prepared to
do

02:14:53.109 --> 02:14:53.119 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:14:56.069 --> 02:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
about the problem of propane storage

across this state
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
which is far from it doesn't even

which is far from it doesn't even
resemble

you know there are dangers with every
 
02:15:22.229 --> 02:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
type of energy
 
02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
more people are killed every year from
 
02:15:26.069 --> 02:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
electrocution than
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
any incidents that are involved with
 
02:15:30.550 --> 02:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
propane propane bulk storage facilities
 
02:15:32.709 --> 02:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
are extremely safe
 
02:15:36.550 --> 02:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
there's not any instances of
 
02:15:39.669 --> 02:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
problems with these facilities and we do
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
have them located
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
um throughout new england to make sure
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
that we have reliable propane available
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
when we have winter storms so that we
 
02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
can provide the backup energy that's
 
02:15:48.639 --> 02:15:49.510 align:start position:0%
can provide the backup energy that's
needed

02:15:49.510 --> 02:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
for generators for elderly for
 
02:15:53.589 --> 02:15:53.599 align:start position:0%
generators for hospitals
 
02:15:56.310 --> 02:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
you know you have to have a backup power
 
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
when the
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
electricity goes out in a hospital and a
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
lot of hospitals turn to
 
02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
propane there's two 30 000 gallon
 
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
propane tanks in augusta maine sitting
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
right next to the hospital
 
02:16:10.709 --> 02:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh and there's you know not a safety
 
02:16:10.719 --> 02:16:11.270 align:start position:0%
uh and there's you know not a safety
issue

02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
um with having them there because there
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
are numerous safety and equipment
 
02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
protocols built into these systems
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
and we as an organization for over three
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
decades have done training with local
 
02:16:23.589 --> 02:16:23.599 align:start position:0%
fire departments
 
02:16:27.030 --> 02:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
we offer a free three-day training
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
tuition for any fire department members
 
02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
that want to come to our training that
 
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
we put on
 
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
in both concord and in massachusetts
 
02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
and at the fire academy in in concord we
 
02:16:39.990 --> 02:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
do a three-day
 
02:16:42.469 --> 02:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
every september that fire departments
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
can come to
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
we also do training throughout new
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire to make sure that our
 
02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
our product is safe so from a risk
 
02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:50.790 align:start position:0%
our product is safe so from a risk
standpoint

02:16:50.790 --> 02:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
and having worked as a risk manager for
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
over two decades
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
i would much rather have propane i have
 
02:16:59.349 --> 02:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
propane in my own home
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
that i use is my heat and i feel that
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's much safer than
 
02:17:06.309 --> 02:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
another energy source thank you miss
 
02:17:06.319 --> 02:17:09.030 align:start position:0%
another energy source thank you miss
anderson

02:17:09.030 --> 02:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
we have mark brown available to
 
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
speak to the issue speak to this
 
02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:18.709 align:start position:0%
speak to the issue speak to this
legislation

02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:23.990 --> 02:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is mark
 
02:17:27.429 --> 02:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
brown i'm the executive director of new
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
england for consumer energy alliance
 
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
cea is a nationwide association made up
 
02:17:34.629 --> 02:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
of both energy consumers and producers
 
02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
working to advance in all the above
 
02:17:37.830 --> 02:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
energy environmental policies that will
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
lower energy costs for every american
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
cea supports actions that thoughtfully
 
02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
advance our nation towards a cleaner
 
02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
more environmentally responsible energy
 
02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:46.870 align:start position:0%
more environmentally responsible energy
future

02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:17:48.549 --> 02:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
um i won't repeat what others have said
 
02:17:50.309 --> 02:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
about this being a consumer choice built
 
02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
but which it clearly is
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
um but what i'll say is that the
 
02:17:55.589 --> 02:17:55.599 align:start position:0%
timeliness and importance of the bill
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
can be
 
02:17:58.870 --> 02:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
understated unfortunately dozens of
 
02:18:00.389 --> 02:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
local mandates
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
and prohibitions have been proposed and
 
02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
passed across the country
 
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
including right next door in
 
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
massachusetts that would deny families
 
02:18:07.830 --> 02:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
and businesses
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
to choose for themselves how they power
 
02:18:11.509 --> 02:18:11.519 align:start position:0%
their homes businesses and even what
 
02:18:13.669 --> 02:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
type of appliances a contractor
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
can install in a home with bills
 
02:18:20.070 --> 02:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
it builds excuse me similar bipartisan
 
02:18:22.469 --> 02:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
legislation to senate bill 86 has passed
 
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
in states
 
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
like florida kentucky west virginia
 
02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
georgia among others
 
02:18:29.589 --> 02:18:29.599 align:start position:0%
to address the aforementioned concerns
 
02:18:29.599 --> 02:18:30.150 align:start position:0%
to address the aforementioned concerns
further

02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:31.599 align:start position:0%
it's very important that we have one
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
state uniform energy policy
 
02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
rather than an unworkable patchwork of
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
local prohibitions and rules
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
that would make service and distribution
 
02:18:42.469 --> 02:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
almost impossible to figure out
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
i want to reiterate and be clear cea
 
02:18:44.719 --> 02:18:45.509 align:start position:0%
i want to reiterate and be clear cea
supports

02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
supports
 
02:18:47.429 --> 02:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
a clean future with lower emissions
 
02:18:49.349 --> 02:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
however misguided attempts to ban
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
natural gas
 
02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
and propane service by forcing mandates
 
02:18:54.549 --> 02:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
onto consumers will lead to
 
02:18:56.150 --> 02:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
higher costs and jeopardize energy
 
02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
resources that are helping our nation
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
reduce emissions
 
02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and i want to touch on one thing
 
02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
about you know what's going on with the
 
02:19:03.589 --> 02:19:03.599 align:start position:0%
energy transition especially when it
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
comes to gas
 
02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
and renewable natural gas you've got
 
02:19:09.669 --> 02:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
things like green hydrogen
 
02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
biomethane synthetic methane that are
 
02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
all going to use pipeline infrastructure
 
02:19:15.429 --> 02:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
that could heat our homes
 
02:19:18.389 --> 02:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
so i think it's a little short-sighted
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
for a municipality to be able to
 
02:19:22.469 --> 02:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
you know prohibit people from making
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
choices um
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
so on behalf of cea i urge you to
 
02:19:27.030 --> 02:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
support this common sense measure that
 
02:19:28.389 --> 02:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
will help shield our neighbors from
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
intrusive and unrealistic mandates
 
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
as well as preserve new hampshire's
 
02:19:34.309 --> 02:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
economic competitiveness
 
02:19:36.549 --> 02:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
and uh with that i'll be happy to take
 
02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:37.599 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:19:39.429 --> 02:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr brown uh representative
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
gallagher you have a question for mr
 
02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:42.309 align:start position:0%
gallagher you have a question for mr
brown

02:19:42.309 --> 02:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
brown
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
yeah so you're saying that
 
02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
there were dozens of these mandates
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
going through municipalities throughout
 
02:19:53.349 --> 02:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
the country but previously
 
02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
cartel johnston had testified that none
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
of them
 
02:19:59.910 --> 02:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
were that there were no such regulations
 
02:20:02.469 --> 02:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so could you just
 
02:20:06.309 --> 02:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
confirm for me that um
 
02:20:07.830 --> 02:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
those two are consistent with one
 
02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
another that none of the
 
02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
that none of the municipalities you
 
02:20:16.309 --> 02:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned were ones in new hampshire
 
02:20:19.030 --> 02:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
sure no no i don't think there has been
 
02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:19.990 align:start position:0%
sure no no i don't think there has been
any

02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:20:22.309 --> 02:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
prohibitions passed in new hampshire but
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
i also add that i think it's important
 
02:20:25.830 --> 02:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
to recognize that you know
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
allowing one town to
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
place a prohibition on you know what
 
02:20:33.270 --> 02:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
type of furnace you could have
 
02:20:35.270 --> 02:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
could lead to you know that impacting
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
the ability of another town
 
02:20:39.510 --> 02:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know a neighboring town to have you
 
02:20:40.630 --> 02:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
know a
 
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
natural gas furnace or whatnot so yeah
 
02:20:43.990 --> 02:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
you are correct
 
02:20:45.429 --> 02:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
there have been no prohibitions in new
 
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire to my knowledge
 
02:20:53.110 --> 02:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um we have uh
 
02:20:57.590 --> 02:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
oh would you like to meet yourself
 
02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to take the floor
 
02:21:03.030 --> 02:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman members
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the committee i will be brief
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
um listening to many questions and the
 
02:21:07.439 --> 02:21:09.190 align:start position:0%
um listening to many questions and the
testimony

02:21:09.190 --> 02:21:09.200 align:start position:0%

02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
we have many many dealers of propane and

we have many many dealers of propane and
oil

02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
oil
 
02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
and this piece of legislation that you
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
have before you part three very
 
02:21:19.920 --> 02:21:21.429 align:start position:0%
have before you part three very
specifically

02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
came about because of their concern of
 
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
what is happening in border states
 
02:21:28.950 --> 02:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
very much massachusetts and in vermont
 
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
and in maine
 
02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
many of our dealers represent customers
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
in both
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
in all those states including new
 
02:21:36.870 --> 02:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire so
 
02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
there is reality out there that their
 
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
future is being threatened
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
and the consumer choice is being taken
 
02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:43.910 align:start position:0%
and the consumer choice is being taken
away

02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
away
 
02:21:47.349 --> 02:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
um a very strong example is in the town
 
02:21:50.389 --> 02:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
of burlington vermont where not only
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
are they going through a process right
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
now with a local community
 
02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
have all new construction be electric
 
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
but they're also mandating that
 
02:22:06.469 --> 02:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
existing heating sources and homes have
 
02:22:07.750 --> 02:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
to transition
 
02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
to electric from their current sources
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
so this
 
02:22:13.830 --> 02:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
this is a reality it's a great concern
 
02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
over 60 percent of the
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
heating in our state is done by propane
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
and oil
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
um so there there is a significant i
 
02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:23.110 align:start position:0%
um so there there is a significant i
think

02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
real based fear that's what happened
 
02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
what's what excuse me what's happening
 
02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
in our border states
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
can creep its way or make its way into
 
02:22:32.389 --> 02:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so
 
02:22:34.230 --> 02:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
um i've heard many discussions on the
 
02:22:36.309 --> 02:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
cleanliness of fuel but from our
 
02:22:36.319 --> 02:22:37.750 align:start position:0%
cleanliness of fuel but from our
perspective

02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:22:39.429 --> 02:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
we would like to leave this as a
 
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
consumer choice
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
um and let the consumer decide if they
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
choose to heat their house with with
 
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
anything other than oil or propane
 
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
then all all the better for them but um
 
02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
we would kindly ask your consideration
 
02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:54.790 align:start position:0%
we would kindly ask your consideration
to

02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:22:57.429 --> 02:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
not let what's happened in massachusetts
 
02:22:57.439 --> 02:22:58.070 align:start position:0%
not let what's happened in massachusetts
vermont

02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
02:22:59.830 --> 02:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
and maine happened in new hampshire and
 
02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
put people's jobs at risk and
 
02:23:03.830 --> 02:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
companies um they've been around for
 
02:23:06.469 --> 02:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
decades uh their very existence at risk
 
02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
so thank you mr chairman

very briefly
 
02:23:30.550 --> 02:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is kat burke
 
02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm the director of government
 
02:23:33.030 --> 02:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
affairs for unitil
 
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
an electric and natural gas distribution
 
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
company here in new hampshire
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
we're here today to voice our support
 
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
for part three of this legislation and
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
just to be clear we are not taking a
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
position on any other
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
section of senate bill 86 as many of you
 
02:23:49.349 --> 02:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
know unitil serves electricity to about
 
02:23:49.359 --> 02:23:49.830 align:start position:0%
know unitil serves electricity to about
80

02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
80
 
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
000 customers here in new hampshire and
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
about 35 000 natural gas customers in
 
02:23:55.750 --> 02:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
the state as well
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
we believe that this is a very
 
02:23:59.110 --> 02:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
straightforward piece of legislation
 
02:24:01.750 --> 02:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
that simply promotes consumer choice
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
as many others have spoken to this
 
02:24:05.510 --> 02:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
morning senator morse
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
mark brown leslie and others this bill
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
preserves the right of an individual
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
customer to connect or utilize
 
02:24:14.309 --> 02:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
any available utility service or source
 
02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
of energy desired
 
02:24:17.590 --> 02:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
to be clear this bill does not seek to
 
02:24:20.070 --> 02:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
tout the benefits of any particular type
 
02:24:22.309 --> 02:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
of fuel or energy source
 
02:24:23.830 --> 02:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
we believe that it's a company that we
 
02:24:25.830 --> 02:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
can and we should provide energy that's
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
both affordable and reliable and to that
 
02:24:28.399 --> 02:24:28.950 align:start position:0%
both affordable and reliable and to that
extent

02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
extent
 
02:24:30.870 --> 02:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
exercising consumer choice to meet those
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
goals is a necessity
 
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions the
 
02:24:35.429 --> 02:24:35.439 align:start position:0%

previously
 
02:24:50.469 --> 02:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
um i was just double checking the um
 
02:24:53.190 --> 02:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
the testifier sheet and i didn't see him
 
02:24:54.070 --> 02:24:54.080 align:start position:0%

02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
mr burke is our last with our last
 
02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:15.429 align:start position:0%
mr burke is our last with our last
speaker

02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
02:25:19.349 --> 02:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
um so uh oh we have a question from
 
02:25:21.270 --> 02:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i had this question
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
for a little while now
 
02:25:28.469 --> 02:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
um we have heard a lot from
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
the propane gas people but we haven't
 
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
heard anything
 
02:25:33.510 --> 02:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
much from the oil people or the cold
 
02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
people or the um
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
solar people or the wind people so i'm
 
02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:39.990 align:start position:0%
solar people or the wind people so i'm
assuming

02:25:39.990 --> 02:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
assuming
 
02:25:43.830 --> 02:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
that they don't have concerns such as
 
02:25:46.870 --> 02:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
the propane people have
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's a statement of just an
 
02:25:51.270 --> 02:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
observation but my second part of my
 
02:25:54.550 --> 02:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:59.349 --> 02:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
if a community overwhelmingly
 
02:25:59.359 --> 02:26:02.790 align:start position:0%
if a community overwhelmingly
desires

02:26:02.790 --> 02:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:09.750 --> 02:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
75 to 80 percent of the population wants
 
02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:16.070 align:start position:0%
75 to 80 percent of the population wants
it

02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
this bill would prohibit them in that
 
02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:20.389 align:start position:0%
this bill would prohibit them in that
community

02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:28.309 --> 02:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
people to use energy sources that are
 
02:26:29.110 --> 02:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
net zero
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
is that correct am i am i reading
 
02:26:37.270 --> 02:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
my director whoever was up last i guess
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
maybe uh anderson did you take that
 
02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:42.950 align:start position:0%
maybe uh anderson did you take that
question

02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:54.389 --> 02:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
i can take that question as well if miss
 
02:26:57.110 --> 02:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
anderson has left okay
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and i think that that's a very um
 
02:27:00.150 --> 02:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative i think that's a very
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
difficult policy question you know that
 
02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:02.070 align:start position:0%
difficult policy question you know that
this

02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
legislature and local communities are
 
02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
faced with right but
 
02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
um you know the important consideration
 
02:27:08.790 --> 02:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
is you know whether or not this could
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
still create this
 
02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
unworkable collection of local
 
02:27:13.349 --> 02:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
prohibitions and rules that
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know would make it difficult for
 
02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
service and distribution to not just one
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
individual town but you know as mr brown
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned perhaps a neighboring town and
 
02:27:23.349 --> 02:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
whether or not this would you know
 
02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
create a much
 
02:27:26.230 --> 02:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
greater cost to consumers you know i
 
02:27:28.309 --> 02:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
think there are many towns that are
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
seeking to go towards net zero or to
 
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
reach net zero and that is
 
02:27:34.469 --> 02:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
certainly a an excellent goal um you
 
02:27:35.270 --> 02:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
know but i think
 
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
limiting any source of energy or any
 
02:27:40.230 --> 02:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
thermal heating source
 
02:27:42.630 --> 02:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
that would allow a town to reach that
 
02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:51.110 --> 02:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
i believe that's going to be our last
 
02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
comment on the bill i'm going to close
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:59.830 --> 02:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 86 and uh
 
02:28:03.030 --> 02:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
we're about 45 minutes behind but that's
 
02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
okay we're getting some good public debt
 
02:28:06.070 --> 02:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
input and that's always
 
02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
a preferred situation uh i'm gonna
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna make our our schedule a little
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
bit worse i'm going to take a
 
02:28:16.870 --> 02:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
five-minute bio break for those on the
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee i'd ask you to be back here by
 
02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
11 37.
 
02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
and uh for those of you in the room or
 
02:28:52.950 --> 02:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:10.710 --> 02:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:28.270 --> 02:29:28.280 align:start position:0%

well i'm the only person i know of so i
 
02:30:27.349 --> 02:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
guess i'd have to bring it back over to
 
02:30:45.510 --> 02:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
well when they when they switched over

well when they when they switched over
to

02:30:49.750 --> 02:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:30:51.990 --> 02:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
the new voting system we used to have a
 
02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:52.870 align:start position:0%
the new voting system we used to have a
key

02:30:52.870 --> 02:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
key
 
02:30:56.389 --> 02:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
we in the legislature when we had
 
02:30:58.389 --> 02:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
he had to turn a key to turn around
 
02:30:59.590 --> 02:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
voting system
 
02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
and they switched it over to the one we
 
02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
have now
 
02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:06.560 align:start position:0%

you know it's people are fascinated by
that

02:31:44.710 --> 02:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
but to me they've all worked
 
02:31:51.190 --> 02:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
you know they truly have
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
fascinated isn't usually the reaction
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:08.830 --> 02:32:08.840 align:start position:0%

02:32:08.840 --> 02:32:10.230 align:start position:0%
the parking lot one was the most
cheapest

02:32:10.230 --> 02:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
cheapest
 
02:32:15.590 --> 02:32:15.600 align:start position:0%

municipal county government uh house
committee

02:40:56.070 --> 02:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:40:58.309 --> 02:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
if you would excuse me like to introduce
 
02:40:59.429 --> 02:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:41:02.550 --> 02:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
the floor is yours thank you chairman
 
02:41:04.309 --> 02:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
dolan i appreciate
 
02:41:07.910 --> 02:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
the introduction and opportunity
 
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 88 is
 
02:41:14.230 --> 02:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
an omnibus bill but i can i'm sure you
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
can see
 
02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
the relationship among the three
 
02:41:19.510 --> 02:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
different parts here
 
02:41:21.510 --> 02:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
all relating to broadband
 
02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:25.190 align:start position:0%
all relating to broadband
implementations

02:41:25.190 --> 02:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:30.070 --> 02:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
these are primarily cleanup
 
02:41:33.269 --> 02:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
pieces they though they cover
 
02:41:37.510 --> 02:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
different parts of statute that
 
02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
affect the installation of broad
 
02:41:46.870 --> 02:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
i believe senator bradley is here to
 
02:41:50.389 --> 02:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh talk about part two of the bill
 
02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh and hopefully uh senator ward is here
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
for part three and if not
 
02:41:57.349 --> 02:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh i think i can answer some of the
 
02:41:59.269 --> 02:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
questions but hopefully you can inform
 
02:42:02.469 --> 02:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:06.469 --> 02:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
i i am uh by the way uh senator jay kahn
 
02:42:09.110 --> 02:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
i represent 15 of 23 towns in cheshire
 
02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:10.070 align:start position:0%
i represent 15 of 23 towns in cheshire
county

02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
and uh i i am the
 
02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
the prime uh sponsor of part one
 
02:42:21.190 --> 02:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
here which is uh specific to something
 
02:42:22.469 --> 02:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
that we adopted
 
02:42:25.510 --> 02:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
the last legislative season uh relative
 
02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:26.389 align:start position:0%
the last legislative season uh relative
to

02:42:26.389 --> 02:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:42:29.830 --> 02:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
allowing for communication districts
 
02:42:32.950 --> 02:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
to form uh much like we
 
02:42:36.150 --> 02:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
would allow for a water district to
 
02:42:41.269 --> 02:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
form between several municipalities
 
02:42:44.710 --> 02:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
this allows that for broadband purposes
 
02:42:47.910 --> 02:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
what we discovered as towns began to
 
02:42:50.950 --> 02:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
work with what was passed last year is
 
02:42:52.230 --> 02:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
that there was a
 
02:42:55.830 --> 02:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
double approval because the language was
 
02:42:55.840 --> 02:42:58.469 align:start position:0%
double approval because the language was
just

02:42:58.469 --> 02:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
not accurate enough so
 
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
this clean up here by striking some of
 
02:43:05.830 --> 02:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
the words
 
02:43:07.750 --> 02:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
makes it very clear that when two
 
02:43:09.670 --> 02:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities have
 
02:43:13.269 --> 02:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
acted on their own to
 
02:43:15.429 --> 02:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
approve a communication district that
 
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
the district shall be formed
 
02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
and that is the nature of part one and
 
02:43:23.349 --> 02:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
i'm glad to take any questions and again
 
02:43:23.359 --> 02:43:23.910 align:start position:0%
i'm glad to take any questions and again
i'll

02:43:23.910 --> 02:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
02:43:27.429 --> 02:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
i'll hang on the uh hearing to
 
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
see if you need me for any other part of
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:43:34.830 --> 02:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
thank you senator i appreciate your time
 
02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:44.870 align:start position:0%
thank you senator i appreciate your time
and

02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:47.910 --> 02:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to work through lunch and
 
02:43:50.870 --> 02:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
we've been terminated the day after
 
02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill 88
 
02:43:57.349 --> 02:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman i'll just i'll just add
 
02:43:59.670 --> 02:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
i've got a judiciary meeting at one and
 
02:44:00.309 --> 02:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
i gotta
 
02:44:02.550 --> 02:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
move from one place to another so anyway
 
02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'm probably
 
02:44:05.349 --> 02:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
i'm good for the next 15 minutes for
 
02:44:06.790 --> 02:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
sure thank you
 
02:44:09.190 --> 02:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
any questions to senator khan yes
 
02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:10.630 align:start position:0%
any questions to senator khan yes
representative

02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:44:12.790 --> 02:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
question uh if you're strike
 
02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
in a vote of the victim of legislative
 
02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
wives which means you don't have to go
 
02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
to town meetings
 
02:44:27.830 --> 02:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
to get uh authorization but who's the
 
02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
acquainting authority uh
 
02:44:35.429 --> 02:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
i i don't know enough about the bill uh
 
02:44:35.439 --> 02:44:35.750 align:start position:0%
i i don't know enough about the bill uh
as

02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
it stands now so i don't know since
 
02:44:38.399 --> 02:44:39.510 align:start position:0%
it stands now so i don't know since
you're

02:44:39.510 --> 02:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:44:42.870 --> 02:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
stripping a board of the respective
 
02:44:46.469 --> 02:44:46.479 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out who would make
 
02:44:50.070 --> 02:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
the appointments
 
02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
and who would determine whether or not
 
02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:12.790 --> 02:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:15.990 --> 02:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
is that that's
 
02:45:19.190 --> 02:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative uh that is how i
 
02:45:19.750 --> 02:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
see it
 
02:45:22.950 --> 02:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh that uh upon
 
02:45:26.870 --> 02:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
the approval to form uh such a district
 
02:45:28.630 --> 02:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
each uh
 
02:45:31.910 --> 02:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
municipality would name two
 
02:45:34.950 --> 02:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh people to it and this could be a five
 
02:45:37.510 --> 02:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
town and i'll just give you outside of
 
02:45:37.520 --> 02:45:38.469 align:start position:0%
town and i'll just give you outside of
my

02:45:38.469 --> 02:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
territory but in the lakes region they
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
very much are thinking about
 
02:45:46.150 --> 02:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh creating a
 
02:45:50.150 --> 02:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh multi-town uh planning group
 
02:45:53.750 --> 02:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh that and and so what we found with
 
02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:54.309 align:start position:0%
uh that and and so what we found with
this

02:45:54.309 --> 02:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:45:58.309 --> 02:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
is that if the
 
02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh bodies create the special committee
 
02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:05.750 align:start position:0%
uh bodies create the special committee
that

02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:07.349 --> 02:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
one they would create the special
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee and then two they would seek
 
02:46:10.309 --> 02:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
the vote
 
02:46:13.429 --> 02:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
of the legislative bodies and so they
 
02:46:14.870 --> 02:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
were having to go through
 
02:46:17.990 --> 02:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
both steps and towns were coming back
 
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
and saying
 
02:46:21.510 --> 02:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
hey you know we aren't able to form
 
02:46:24.230 --> 02:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
these districts
 
02:46:26.469 --> 02:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
until a year later after we've
 
02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
determined that
 
02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
we we want to participate in the
 
02:46:31.439 --> 02:46:33.110 align:start position:0%
we we want to participate in the
district

02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:46:34.469 --> 02:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
then we've got to go back to the
 
02:46:38.070 --> 02:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
legislative body to get their vote
 
02:46:41.349 --> 02:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
so that this is uh coming before you
 
02:46:45.190 --> 02:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative power
 
02:46:48.309 --> 02:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and um thank you
 
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
senator for taking this question
 
02:46:52.550 --> 02:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i'm
 
02:46:55.990 --> 02:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
still unclear as to
 
02:46:59.590 --> 02:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
the process and what's not clear to me
 
02:47:02.630 --> 02:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
is a communications district that first
 
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
formed and then this planning committee
 
02:47:09.750 --> 02:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
is formed out of that or it's what
 
02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
is being proposed to be formed as a
 
02:47:13.120 --> 02:47:14.150 align:start position:0%
is being proposed to be formed as a
committee

02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:47:17.670 --> 02:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
first and then a district a
 
02:47:19.990 --> 02:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
communications district
 
02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
then formed are there two things being
 
02:47:23.910 --> 02:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
formed or what
 
02:47:26.950 --> 02:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's not clear it is one it is
 
02:47:30.230 --> 02:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
the it is to create the committee uh it
 
02:47:33.349 --> 02:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
would take then a warrant article
 
02:47:37.349 --> 02:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
by each town to authorize
 
02:47:39.830 --> 02:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
participation in the district and any
 
02:47:41.910 --> 02:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
kind of funding arrangement
 
02:47:49.269 --> 02:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
to to move the district forward
 
02:47:53.190 --> 02:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes so um do i understand it
 
02:47:54.389 --> 02:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
correctly that
 
02:47:57.830 --> 02:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
the governing boards of
 
02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
two or more municipalities will move
 
02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
forward to establish this committee
 
02:48:06.870 --> 02:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
without um buying it from the
 
02:48:13.269 --> 02:48:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:20.469 --> 02:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
i believe that that is the case i'm
 
02:48:23.040 --> 02:48:23.750 align:start position:0%
i believe that that is the case i'm
gonna

02:48:23.750 --> 02:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
02:48:25.910 --> 02:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
go check that statute because it's a
 
02:48:27.670 --> 02:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
fairly short uh
 
02:48:31.110 --> 02:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
section uh thank you thank you
 
02:48:36.950 --> 02:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:40.230 --> 02:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none let's uh move section two
 
02:48:42.469 --> 02:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
to be introduced by senator bradley
 
02:48:48.150 --> 02:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:51.510 --> 02:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
good morning how are you good
 
02:48:55.030 --> 02:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you very much uh jeb bradley
 
02:48:58.389 --> 02:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
from senate district 3 and pleased to be
 
02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
here with senator khan
 
02:49:03.910 --> 02:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
in support of senate bill 88 which the
 
02:49:07.110 --> 02:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:10.230 --> 02:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
unanimously so section 2
 
02:49:14.469 --> 02:49:14.479 align:start position:0%
was a request of um
 
02:49:17.349 --> 02:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
many different communities that are in
 
02:49:18.230 --> 02:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
the planning
 
02:49:22.070 --> 02:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
process of trying to develop broadband
 
02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
and what it would do
 
02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
was allow so-called one-touch
 
02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:27.269 align:start position:0%
was allow so-called one-touch
application

02:49:27.269 --> 02:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
application
 
02:49:31.030 --> 02:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
to simplify the deployment of wires
 
02:49:35.190 --> 02:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
on poles oftentimes
 
02:49:38.630 --> 02:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
there's a process between an electric
 
02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
utility a phone utility
 
02:49:44.389 --> 02:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
um cable utility um
 
02:49:47.750 --> 02:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
so what this would do
 
02:49:51.190 --> 02:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
would implement the onetouch fcc
 
02:49:54.950 --> 02:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
plan and lead to cost reductions
 
02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:03.030 --> 02:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's why we're supporting it the
 
02:50:05.349 --> 02:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
senate adopted it the one change i might
 
02:50:06.150 --> 02:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
ask you to
 
02:50:09.910 --> 02:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
make mr chairman is to make this
 
02:50:18.309 --> 02:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:30.710 --> 02:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
i have a question uh senator in
 
02:50:35.349 --> 02:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
on page two of the bill line
 
02:50:38.309 --> 02:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
lines four three through nine talks
 
02:50:38.319 --> 02:50:38.950 align:start position:0%
lines four three through nine talks
about

02:50:38.950 --> 02:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:50:43.349 --> 02:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
um the party agreed to the following
 
02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
alternative timelines but there's
 
02:50:46.630 --> 02:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
nothing following there is there
 
02:50:50.309 --> 02:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
is that uh am i not understanding the
 
02:50:55.110 --> 02:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:04.309 --> 02:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
so there's a um
 
02:51:06.469 --> 02:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
the commission the public utilities
 
02:51:08.230 --> 02:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
commission would have to implement
 
02:51:11.429 --> 02:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
uh timelines for uh
 
02:51:14.469 --> 02:51:14.479 align:start position:0%
the deployment of um
 
02:51:17.269 --> 02:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
or excuse me of the rules process for
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
how this would work
 
02:51:22.870 --> 02:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
and then this language would mean that
 
02:51:25.429 --> 02:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
any agreements would have to function
 
02:52:09.510 --> 02:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:11.349 --> 02:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
i had a hard time hearing your question
 
02:52:13.750 --> 02:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
but as i heard it i think
 
02:52:16.950 --> 02:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
it would facilitate uh cooperation
 
02:52:16.960 --> 02:52:18.469 align:start position:0%
it would facilitate uh cooperation
between

02:52:18.469 --> 02:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:52:22.469 --> 02:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
various entities that had uh wires on
 
02:52:22.479 --> 02:52:23.269 align:start position:0%
various entities that had uh wires on
poles

02:52:23.269 --> 02:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
poles
 
02:52:26.469 --> 02:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
and by having a process to do so would
 
02:52:26.479 --> 02:52:27.190 align:start position:0%
and by having a process to do so would
make

02:52:27.190 --> 02:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
this a much less duplicative process
 
02:52:33.990 --> 02:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
it would prevent delay uh it would lead
 
02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:34.309 align:start position:0%
it would prevent delay uh it would lead
to

02:52:34.309 --> 02:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:52:36.790 --> 02:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
better implementation and cost savings
 
02:52:36.800 --> 02:52:37.349 align:start position:0%
better implementation and cost savings
so

02:52:37.349 --> 02:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:52:40.950 --> 02:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of uh this one touch
 
02:52:44.710 --> 02:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
um initiative which as
 
02:52:49.429 --> 02:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
as you see at the bottom of page one um
 
02:52:50.950 --> 02:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's adopted by the federal
 
02:52:53.110 --> 02:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
communications commission
 
02:52:57.670 --> 02:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
already so this is not um
 
02:52:59.670 --> 02:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
something really radically new and
 
02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:03.670 align:start position:0%
something really radically new and
different

02:53:03.670 --> 02:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes uh
 
02:53:07.750 --> 02:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm standing up to sell it
 
02:53:14.230 --> 02:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
yes uh senator bradley thanks for taking
 
02:53:17.990 --> 02:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
my question would the
 
02:53:22.070 --> 02:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
scope of this bill
 
02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
also impact non-wired
 
02:53:30.870 --> 02:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
utilities for instance cell phones
 
02:53:35.269 --> 02:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
or satellite satellite technology
 
02:53:38.550 --> 02:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
no no this is um
 
02:53:41.830 --> 02:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
you know just a one touch make ready for
 
02:53:51.030 --> 02:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:54.070 --> 02:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
and that would include fiber optics am i
 
02:53:54.080 --> 02:53:55.429 align:start position:0%
and that would include fiber optics am i
correct

02:53:55.429 --> 02:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:53:58.070 --> 02:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
yes anything that's wired and fiber
 
02:54:00.230 --> 02:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
optic is a wired technology but
 
02:54:04.550 --> 02:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
not satellite um technology
 
02:54:07.750 --> 02:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative mentioned uh
 
02:54:10.389 --> 02:54:10.399 align:start position:0%
reporter thank you mr chair thank you
 
02:54:11.670 --> 02:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
senator bradley i
 
02:54:13.670 --> 02:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm seeking a clarification too
 
02:54:14.790 --> 02:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm remembering
 
02:54:16.870 --> 02:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
the bill that uh representative pimanchi
 
02:54:19.190 --> 02:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
was speaking about that we got last year
 
02:54:23.190 --> 02:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
um getting telephone poles taken down
 
02:54:26.630 --> 02:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
was a process because many different
 
02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
organizations were attaching their wires
 
02:54:30.309 --> 02:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
and then one by one they would have to
 
02:54:30.319 --> 02:54:30.790 align:start position:0%
and then one by one they would have to
take

02:54:30.790 --> 02:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
take
 
02:54:33.269 --> 02:54:33.279 align:start position:0%
take them off took a long time to do
 
02:54:35.030 --> 02:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
that was holding up progress
 
02:54:37.750 --> 02:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
i'm understanding that this provision
 
02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
that you're putting forward here
 
02:54:43.110 --> 02:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
would eliminate that need for the one
 
02:54:45.670 --> 02:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
one of the time kind of situation is
 
02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:46.150 align:start position:0%
one of the time kind of situation is
that

02:54:46.150 --> 02:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:48.950 --> 02:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
am i right about that yeah under a
 
02:54:48.960 --> 02:54:49.590 align:start position:0%
am i right about that yeah under a
protocol

02:54:49.590 --> 02:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
protocol
 
02:54:51.429 --> 02:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
established by the public utilities
 
02:54:52.950 --> 02:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
commission then
 
02:54:55.990 --> 02:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
you would be able to um
 
02:54:59.030 --> 02:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
facilitate the you know installation the
 
02:55:00.230 --> 02:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
quicker installation
 
02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
of any of the wires going on polls
 
02:55:08.950 --> 02:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:11.269 --> 02:55:11.279 align:start position:0%
yes sir representative powell thank you
 
02:55:12.870 --> 02:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and thank you senator
 
02:55:14.870 --> 02:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
bradley for taking my question
 
02:55:17.750 --> 02:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
the question is under the one touch make
 
02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:19.590 align:start position:0%
the question is under the one touch make
ready

02:55:19.590 --> 02:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
ready
 
02:55:23.750 --> 02:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
i guess program if you will um
 
02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
where does the field service crews come
 
02:55:27.750 --> 02:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
from and what
 
02:55:30.469 --> 02:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
because you have different utilities
 
02:55:30.479 --> 02:55:31.269 align:start position:0%
because you have different utilities
companies

02:55:31.269 --> 02:55:31.279 align:start position:0%
companies
 
02:55:34.070 --> 02:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
attaching their wires to the utility
 
02:55:34.080 --> 02:55:35.429 align:start position:0%
attaching their wires to the utility
poles

02:55:35.429 --> 02:55:35.439 align:start position:0%
poles
 
02:55:39.110 --> 02:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
and so utility um you know their
 
02:55:42.230 --> 02:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
field service technicians are trained
 
02:55:44.550 --> 02:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
and certified for that particular
 
02:55:44.560 --> 02:55:45.590 align:start position:0%
and certified for that particular
utility

02:55:45.590 --> 02:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
utility
 
02:55:48.389 --> 02:55:48.399 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is this one touch
 
02:55:48.399 --> 02:55:49.030 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is this one touch
makes

02:55:49.030 --> 02:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
makes
 
02:55:52.550 --> 02:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
make ready utilizes a single field
 
02:55:55.830 --> 02:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
um service technician team
 
02:55:58.630 --> 02:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering where does those
 
02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
teams come from
 
02:56:03.349 --> 02:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
and how are they trained to be able to
 
02:56:07.110 --> 02:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
um move all different types of
 
02:56:10.389 --> 02:56:10.399 align:start position:0%
utility lines so
 
02:56:11.990 --> 02:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there would
 
02:56:13.429 --> 02:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
have to be cooperation
 
02:56:15.750 --> 02:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
obviously between the the various
 
02:56:17.670 --> 02:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
utilities but i think if you look
 
02:56:21.510 --> 02:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
at line seven on page two
 
02:56:23.190 --> 02:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a rule-making
 
02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:24.710 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a rule-making
process

02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:56:26.469 --> 02:56:26.479 align:start position:0%
to implement this at the public
 
02:56:27.830 --> 02:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
utilities commission
 
02:56:31.830 --> 02:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
this um you know part two of
 
02:56:35.030 --> 02:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
senate bill 88 merely authorizes
 
02:56:36.870 --> 02:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
and directs the commission to move
 
02:56:38.550 --> 02:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
forward with that
 
02:56:43.269 --> 02:56:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:46.630 --> 02:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
what follow up um so i i wonder
 
02:56:50.389 --> 02:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
um is it possible i guess my concern is
 
02:56:52.469 --> 02:56:52.479 align:start position:0%
with it would they be third party
 
02:56:55.429 --> 02:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
um you know utility field service
 
02:56:55.439 --> 02:56:56.469 align:start position:0%
um you know utility field service
technicians

02:56:56.469 --> 02:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
technicians
 
02:56:58.870 --> 02:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
or would these um one touch make ready
 
02:56:58.880 --> 02:56:59.590 align:start position:0%
or would these um one touch make ready
teams

02:56:59.590 --> 02:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
teams
 
02:57:03.510 --> 02:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
be comprised of different members
 
02:57:04.950 --> 02:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
i guess that would make sense because
 
02:57:06.550 --> 02:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
you would need to have you would
 
02:57:10.230 --> 02:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately want one person in the
 
02:57:13.750 --> 02:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
lift bucket moving the wires so that
 
02:57:15.349 --> 02:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
that individual that would have to be
 
02:57:17.110 --> 02:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
trained and certified across
 
02:57:20.070 --> 02:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
all different utilities is that correct
 
02:57:20.550 --> 02:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:57:24.150 --> 02:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
that would be um a question if
 
02:57:27.190 --> 02:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
anybody from the puc is um
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
on this call to ask of them my
 
02:57:31.349 --> 02:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they
 
02:57:32.950 --> 02:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at line seven they're going
 
02:57:35.710 --> 02:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
to have to adopt rules pursuant to
 
02:57:39.830 --> 02:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
541a um for negotiating and implementing
 
02:57:42.070 --> 02:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
the poll attachments so
 
02:57:45.830 --> 02:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
um you know that kind of
 
02:57:49.910 --> 02:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
detail is left to the rulemaking process
 
02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:52.309 align:start position:0%
detail is left to the rulemaking process
you

02:57:52.309 --> 02:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:54.469 --> 02:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a question of
 
02:57:56.950 --> 02:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher
 
02:57:59.590 --> 02:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
so yeah um this is kind of a follow up
 
02:58:02.230 --> 02:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
to replace alice's question
 
02:58:05.349 --> 02:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
um his was about wire
 
02:58:08.630 --> 02:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
so yeah it's about um applicability of
 
02:58:11.269 --> 02:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
yeah what this applies to his was about
 
02:58:13.670 --> 02:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
wired versus wireless mine is about
 
02:58:17.429 --> 02:58:17.439 align:start position:0%
um different kinds of wires so
 
02:58:19.269 --> 02:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
it talks about poll attachment
 
02:58:21.710 --> 02:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
agreements but what about
 
02:58:25.349 --> 02:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have decided to
 
02:58:29.910 --> 02:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
bury their wires instead of
 
02:58:32.469 --> 02:58:32.479 align:start position:0%
attaching them to poles how does that
 
02:58:34.630 --> 02:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
apply here
 
02:58:38.309 --> 02:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
well again i think if you look at the
 
02:58:38.319 --> 02:58:39.429 align:start position:0%
well again i think if you look at the
language

02:58:39.429 --> 02:58:39.439 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:58:42.550 --> 02:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
on page two starting in line five
 
02:58:58.230 --> 02:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:01.750 --> 02:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
next up we have uh mark dean like
 
02:59:08.309 --> 02:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
mr dean are you available i am available
 
02:59:12.840 --> 02:59:14.309 align:start position:0%
mr dean are you available i am available
yes

02:59:14.309 --> 02:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:59:16.550 --> 02:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
my name is mark dean i'm the general
 
02:59:18.309 --> 02:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
counsel for new hampshire electric
 
02:59:18.319 --> 02:59:19.429 align:start position:0%
counsel for new hampshire electric
cooperative

02:59:19.429 --> 02:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
cooperative
 
02:59:22.550 --> 02:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
and i have submitted uh written
 
02:59:22.560 --> 02:59:23.990 align:start position:0%
and i have submitted uh written
testimony

02:59:23.990 --> 02:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:59:26.309 --> 02:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
and i think i can maybe shed light on a
 
02:59:28.870 --> 02:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
couple of the questions that have been
 
02:59:32.309 --> 02:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
asked of senator bradley um the the
 
02:59:32.319 --> 02:59:33.110 align:start position:0%
asked of senator bradley um the the
co-op

02:59:33.110 --> 02:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
co-op
 
02:59:35.670 --> 02:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
wears two hats in this environment now
 
02:59:36.710 --> 02:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
it used to be
 
02:59:39.030 --> 02:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
since 1939 it was just one hat
 
02:59:39.040 --> 02:59:40.230 align:start position:0%
since 1939 it was just one hat
electricity

02:59:40.230 --> 02:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
02:59:43.510 --> 02:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
um but the co-op is now embarking on
 
02:59:44.710 --> 02:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
efforts to make sure
 
02:59:47.269 --> 02:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
that broadband service is available to
 
02:59:47.279 --> 02:59:48.070 align:start position:0%
that broadband service is available to
its

02:59:48.070 --> 02:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
its
 
02:59:51.670 --> 02:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
members so it has uh done some broadband
 
02:59:51.680 --> 02:59:53.110 align:start position:0%
members so it has uh done some broadband
installations

02:59:53.110 --> 02:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
installations
 
02:59:56.230 --> 02:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh so we are familiar with the
 
02:59:59.510 --> 02:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
issue of make ready work both as
 
03:00:02.230 --> 03:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
a poll owner we own about a hundred
 
03:00:02.240 --> 03:00:02.790 align:start position:0%
a poll owner we own about a hundred
thousand

03:00:02.790 --> 03:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
03:00:05.510 --> 03:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
polls in the state of new hampshire and
 
03:00:07.349 --> 03:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
if the co-op builds out a broadband
 
03:00:09.110 --> 03:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
system it will mainly be using those
 
03:00:11.269 --> 03:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
poles but it will also be attaching to
 
03:00:13.510 --> 03:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
poles that are owned by cci and maybe
 
03:00:15.510 --> 03:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
some by eversource or other utilities so
 
03:00:17.590 --> 03:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
we're on both sides of the
 
03:00:21.110 --> 03:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
the transactions if you will we strongly
 
03:00:21.120 --> 03:00:23.110 align:start position:0%
the transactions if you will we strongly
support

03:00:23.110 --> 03:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:00:26.469 --> 03:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
this bill uh and strongly support the
 
03:00:28.550 --> 03:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion that senator bradley made
 
03:00:30.630 --> 03:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
about amending the effective date to be
 
03:00:30.640 --> 03:00:31.110 align:start position:0%
about amending the effective date to be
as

03:00:31.110 --> 03:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:00:34.630 --> 03:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
out of passage uh instead of 60 days
 
03:00:36.309 --> 03:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
after passage and
 
03:00:38.630 --> 03:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
that's because really all this bill does
 
03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:39.349 align:start position:0%
that's because really all this bill does
is

03:00:39.349 --> 03:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:00:41.590 --> 03:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
start the clock running on a puc rule
 
03:00:43.429 --> 03:00:43.439 align:start position:0%
making process
 
03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
and uh as many of you may know that's a
 
03:00:46.800 --> 03:00:47.429 align:start position:0%
and uh as many of you may know that's a
process

03:00:47.429 --> 03:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:00:49.349 --> 03:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
both at the commission and then going
 
03:00:51.670 --> 03:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
through jalcar afterwards
 
03:00:53.750 --> 03:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
takes a number of months in the best of
 
03:00:53.760 --> 03:00:55.910 align:start position:0%
takes a number of months in the best of
circumstances

03:00:55.910 --> 03:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
03:00:59.190 --> 03:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
so the earlier the puc gets started on
 
03:01:00.790 --> 03:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
that the better as far as we're
 
03:01:01.750 --> 03:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
concerned because
 
03:01:04.630 --> 03:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
many entities will hopefully be out
 
03:01:08.469 --> 03:01:08.479 align:start position:0%
there in 2021 trying to expand broadband
 
03:01:08.479 --> 03:01:09.349 align:start position:0%
there in 2021 trying to expand broadband
services

03:01:09.349 --> 03:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:01:11.830 --> 03:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and uh the availability
 
03:01:13.030 --> 03:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
of the one touch
 
03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
option is something that uh will help
 
03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:16.950 align:start position:0%
option is something that uh will help
speed

03:01:16.950 --> 03:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
speed
 
03:01:20.950 --> 03:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
deployment uh just to step back a
 
03:01:23.269 --> 03:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
few feet here which may help with some
 
03:01:25.110 --> 03:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
of the questions so when we talk about
 
03:01:27.030 --> 03:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
make ready work we're talking about
 
03:01:30.150 --> 03:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
poles and we're talking either about
 
03:01:32.150 --> 03:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
replacing a pole if the pole is too
 
03:01:34.230 --> 03:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
small to accommodate the additional
 
03:01:34.240 --> 03:01:35.429 align:start position:0%
small to accommodate the additional
attachment

03:01:35.429 --> 03:01:35.439 align:start position:0%
attachment
 
03:01:38.469 --> 03:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
or rearranging the attachments that
 
03:01:38.479 --> 03:01:38.950 align:start position:0%
or rearranging the attachments that
exist

03:01:38.950 --> 03:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
exist
 
03:01:42.309 --> 03:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
on the pole in order to accommodate a
 
03:01:45.670 --> 03:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
new additional attachment so a lot of
 
03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:46.469 align:start position:0%
new additional attachment so a lot of
polls

03:01:46.469 --> 03:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
polls
 
03:01:48.230 --> 03:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
there is no make ready work needed
 
03:01:49.670 --> 03:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
there's just enough space
 
03:01:52.469 --> 03:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
to have say a fiber cop fiber optic
 
03:01:53.990 --> 03:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
cable added
 
03:01:56.550 --> 03:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
many poles the attachments need to be
 
03:01:56.560 --> 03:01:57.670 align:start position:0%
many poles the attachments need to be
rearranged

03:01:57.670 --> 03:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
rearranged
 
03:02:00.710 --> 03:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
and the way that has generally worked
 
03:02:04.469 --> 03:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
is the entity that wants to add the new
 
03:02:04.479 --> 03:02:05.429 align:start position:0%
is the entity that wants to add the new
attachment

03:02:05.429 --> 03:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
attachment
 
03:02:08.710 --> 03:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
that approaches the poll owner and
 
03:02:12.469 --> 03:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
indicates that enters a poll attachment
 
03:02:15.190 --> 03:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
agreement and then when polls are
 
03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:16.150 align:start position:0%
agreement and then when polls are
identified

03:02:16.150 --> 03:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
identified
 
03:02:19.990 --> 03:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
where attachments need to be moved
 
03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh there's this process and this is
 
03:02:23.750 --> 03:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
what's been mentioned in the bill that
 
03:02:23.760 --> 03:02:24.630 align:start position:0%
what's been mentioned in the bill that
was

03:02:24.630 --> 03:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:02:27.990 --> 03:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
in last year and is now
 
03:02:30.469 --> 03:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
that got transformed into a commission
 
03:02:32.070 --> 03:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
proposal to study
 
03:02:34.389 --> 03:02:34.399 align:start position:0%
these we call them orphaned polls where
 
03:02:36.309 --> 03:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
the last entity that was supposed to get
 
03:02:37.910 --> 03:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
off the pole
 
03:02:40.150 --> 03:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
in this process doesn't do it and so you
 
03:02:41.510 --> 03:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
end up with two poles
 
03:02:44.870 --> 03:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
standing there for quite some time um
 
03:02:48.950 --> 03:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
so in the make the one touch make ready
 
03:02:53.030 --> 03:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
essentially uh the parties can agree
 
03:02:56.150 --> 03:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
and an attacher can insist if the own
 
03:02:59.510 --> 03:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
poll owner can't do it quickly enough
 
03:03:02.950 --> 03:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
that a third-party contractor
 
03:03:05.830 --> 03:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
will basically come in and they'll move
 
03:03:07.990 --> 03:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
each of the attachments
 
03:03:10.230 --> 03:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
so that's the one touch so it's one stop
 
03:03:12.389 --> 03:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
instead of having one utility move their
 
03:03:12.399 --> 03:03:13.429 align:start position:0%
instead of having one utility move their
equipment

03:03:13.429 --> 03:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
then they put in a notice to the other
 
03:03:17.670 --> 03:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
utilities that we've got our job done
 
03:03:18.150 --> 03:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:03:20.469 --> 03:03:20.479 align:start position:0%
each one sequentially comes out and does
 
03:03:20.479 --> 03:03:22.630 align:start position:0%
each one sequentially comes out and does
it

03:03:22.630 --> 03:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:03:25.429 --> 03:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
it moves the pace of things along the
 
03:03:25.439 --> 03:03:25.990 align:start position:0%
it moves the pace of things along the
entity

03:03:25.990 --> 03:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
entity
 
03:03:29.030 --> 03:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
that requested the attachment to begin
 
03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:29.349 align:start position:0%
that requested the attachment to begin
with

03:03:29.349 --> 03:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:03:31.269 --> 03:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
is still going to be responsible for the
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
cost associated with it nothing
 
03:03:35.510 --> 03:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
changes there the system just becomes
 
03:03:37.110 --> 03:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
more efficient
 
03:03:39.910 --> 03:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
and to the one question that was asked
 
03:03:39.920 --> 03:03:40.429 align:start position:0%
and to the one question that was asked
about

03:03:40.429 --> 03:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:03:43.510 --> 03:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
qualifications the way the fcc system
 
03:03:43.520 --> 03:03:45.190 align:start position:0%
qualifications the way the fcc system
works

03:03:45.190 --> 03:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
works
 
03:03:48.469 --> 03:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
is that every utility every poll owner
 
03:03:50.230 --> 03:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
is going to have to have a list of
 
03:03:52.230 --> 03:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
approved contractors
 
03:03:55.510 --> 03:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
to work on their polls
 
03:03:59.269 --> 03:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
and also the reality especially in the
 
03:04:01.910 --> 03:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh fiber deployment associated with
 
03:04:04.150 --> 03:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
broadband is for the most part this work
 
03:04:04.790 --> 03:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
is done
 
03:04:08.230 --> 03:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
by specialty contractors
 
03:04:10.630 --> 03:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
anyways it's not usually going to be
 
03:04:10.640 --> 03:04:11.990 align:start position:0%
anyways it's not usually going to be
utility

03:04:11.990 --> 03:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
utility
 
03:04:15.349 --> 03:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
workers doing the work so from the
 
03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
co-ops perspective
 
03:04:21.269 --> 03:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
this is an improvement it doesn't shift
 
03:04:23.510 --> 03:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
cost responsibilities from one party to
 
03:04:26.389 --> 03:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
another over the existing arrangements
 
03:04:28.630 --> 03:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
but it will be more efficient and we
 
03:04:30.309 --> 03:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
believe more cost effective
 
03:04:33.110 --> 03:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
and hopefully faster which i think is
 
03:04:33.120 --> 03:04:33.590 align:start position:0%
and hopefully faster which i think is
what

03:04:33.590 --> 03:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:04:35.349 --> 03:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
senator bradley was trying to achieve
 
03:04:35.359 --> 03:04:38.309 align:start position:0%
senator bradley was trying to achieve
here

03:04:38.309 --> 03:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:39.990 --> 03:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
senator khan did you have a question or
 
03:04:41.910 --> 03:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
was that your hand up
 
03:04:47.670 --> 03:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:49.830 --> 03:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
i assume that i assume yes thank you
 
03:04:51.190 --> 03:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:04:54.870 --> 03:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
i i just wanted to get back to represent
 
03:04:54.880 --> 03:04:56.150 align:start position:0%
i i just wanted to get back to represent
power

03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
power
 
03:04:59.590 --> 03:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
if i might uh to say
 
03:05:02.870 --> 03:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
that the communication district and its
 
03:05:05.990 --> 03:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
forming parallels the person that a
 
03:05:09.110 --> 03:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
a town or municipality would use
 
03:05:12.230 --> 03:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
so the formation of a committee
 
03:05:15.429 --> 03:05:15.439 align:start position:0%
does not require anything more than
 
03:05:18.710 --> 03:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
a action by the legislative body
 
03:05:21.910 --> 03:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen town council city
 
03:05:21.920 --> 03:05:24.550 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen town council city
council

03:05:24.550 --> 03:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:29.030 --> 03:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
and it is it is merely to enter
 
03:05:32.389 --> 03:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
into a joint uh planning
 
03:05:35.910 --> 03:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
and and that's that's the goal of the
 
03:05:37.830 --> 03:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
establishing the communication district
 
03:05:40.469 --> 03:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
there's no obligation
 
03:05:43.590 --> 03:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
that the communication district
 
03:05:46.710 --> 03:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
actually form should that form for the
 
03:05:48.950 --> 03:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
purpose of
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
moving forward with a broadband project
 
03:05:51.120 --> 03:05:53.510 align:start position:0%
moving forward with a broadband project
then

03:05:53.510 --> 03:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:56.630 --> 03:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
that would take an action of the
 
03:06:04.790 --> 03:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:07.349 --> 03:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
any questions uh further about
 
03:06:07.359 --> 03:06:08.150 align:start position:0%
any questions uh further about
representative

03:06:08.150 --> 03:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:06:12.830 --> 03:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:12.840 --> 03:06:21.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:06:21.429 --> 03:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:24.870 --> 03:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
that many polls what is the estimated
 
03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:35.830 --> 03:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
can you hear me i've been having a
 
03:06:37.269 --> 03:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
little problem getting unmuted okay
 
03:06:37.279 --> 03:06:37.830 align:start position:0%
little problem getting unmuted okay
great

03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:06:40.469 --> 03:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
um so i guess your ques is your question
 
03:06:42.309 --> 03:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
how long
 
03:06:45.510 --> 03:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
a project would take or how long would
 
03:06:47.910 --> 03:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
a project covering the co-op service
 
03:06:49.429 --> 03:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
territory i
 
03:06:51.670 --> 03:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure the scope of the question
 
03:06:56.950 --> 03:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
for completion i
 
03:06:59.190 --> 03:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
again i didn't really hear what the
 
03:07:01.269 --> 03:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
project was
 
03:07:04.309 --> 03:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh my question uh was uh estimated time
 
03:07:05.269 --> 03:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
of completion
 
03:07:08.070 --> 03:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
of uh this uh project that you have a
 
03:07:10.710 --> 03:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand plus polls
 
03:07:13.349 --> 03:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
oh um i guess all i could say at this
 
03:07:15.190 --> 03:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
point is multi-year it's not like there
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
is a
 
03:07:19.670 --> 03:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
full 100 000 poll
 
03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
project you know on the books for the
 
03:07:24.309 --> 03:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
co-op it's in the process of
 
03:07:26.469 --> 03:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
developing that plan but it's a
 
03:07:26.479 --> 03:07:28.389 align:start position:0%
developing that plan but it's a
multi-year

03:07:28.389 --> 03:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
multi-year
 
03:07:35.030 --> 03:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:37.269 --> 03:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions about
 
03:07:39.190 --> 03:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
section two before we move on to part
 
03:07:39.200 --> 03:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
section two before we move on to part
three

03:07:43.670 --> 03:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:58.710 --> 03:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:04.469 --> 03:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:07.830 --> 03:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
does the uh tesla starlink uh
 
03:08:10.710 --> 03:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
project is that projected to have any
 
03:08:10.720 --> 03:08:11.269 align:start position:0%
project is that projected to have any
impact

03:08:11.269 --> 03:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
impact
 
03:08:13.750 --> 03:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
on the the project for the hundred
 
03:08:18.790 --> 03:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:22.150 --> 03:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
well the existence of starlink as with
 
03:08:23.510 --> 03:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
potential competition
 
03:08:25.910 --> 03:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
from you know any other source it'll be
 
03:08:27.030 --> 03:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
a factor that
 
03:08:36.469 --> 03:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:38.389 --> 03:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
any other any other questions that you
 
03:08:40.550 --> 03:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
need to follow up or you could
 
03:08:44.309 --> 03:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
i i guess a follow-up if i may
 
03:08:47.349 --> 03:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm not quite sure
 
03:08:50.150 --> 03:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
about the answer that i just got it
 
03:08:52.070 --> 03:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
seemed a little
 
03:08:54.950 --> 03:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
waffley if you will but um i mean have
 
03:08:54.960 --> 03:08:55.349 align:start position:0%
waffley if you will but um i mean have
you

03:08:55.349 --> 03:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:08:59.590 --> 03:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
actually integrated the tesla starlink
 
03:09:01.510 --> 03:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
project in your planning
 
03:09:04.630 --> 03:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
and has it affected the numbers in any
 
03:09:04.640 --> 03:09:05.110 align:start position:0%
and has it affected the numbers in any
way

03:09:05.110 --> 03:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:09:08.630 --> 03:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
or your projections i guess
 
03:09:13.269 --> 03:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
i um won't testify about the specific
 
03:09:15.269 --> 03:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
financial projections that the co-op's
 
03:09:16.630 --> 03:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
using for its
 
03:09:19.830 --> 03:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
business plan but it has taken into
 
03:09:19.840 --> 03:09:20.389 align:start position:0%
business plan but it has taken into
account

03:09:20.389 --> 03:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
account
 
03:09:24.070 --> 03:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
and looked at the uh
 
03:09:27.910 --> 03:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
the competitive threat or the effect
 
03:09:31.590 --> 03:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
that starlink may have on
 
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
the number of consumers served by the
 
03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
co-op that would
 
03:09:38.550 --> 03:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
take its service so it has taken that
 
03:09:40.469 --> 03:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
into account
 
03:09:43.269 --> 03:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
thank you that's much more helpful thank
 
03:09:45.429 --> 03:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
you before we go to section
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
three uh just for those who are keeping
 
03:09:49.670 --> 03:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
track of these types of numbers
 
03:09:52.870 --> 03:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh you've had people sign in on this
 
03:09:52.880 --> 03:09:53.590 align:start position:0%
uh you've had people sign in on this
bill

03:09:53.590 --> 03:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:09:57.510 --> 03:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
71 or in support zero oppose it
 
03:10:00.790 --> 03:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
zero or neutral about it so those like i
 
03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
said those will keep track of those
 
03:10:03.990 --> 03:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
numbers there they are
 
03:10:06.950 --> 03:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
so our next uh discussion is going to be
 
03:10:08.550 --> 03:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
on part three of the bill
 
03:10:10.830 --> 03:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
which is gonna be introduced by senator
 
03:10:10.840 --> 03:10:12.630 align:start position:0%
which is gonna be introduced by senator
ward

03:10:12.630 --> 03:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
ward
 
03:10:37.110 --> 03:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:41.750 --> 03:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
sending the request over mr chair okay
 
03:10:44.389 --> 03:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
entirely possibly some reward might be
 
03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
compromised with another meeting
 
03:10:49.269 --> 03:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
okay while we wait for her to uh to come
 
03:10:50.950 --> 03:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
back to us we have
 
03:10:54.070 --> 03:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh carol monroe
 
03:10:57.830 --> 03:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
who is a member of the public would like
 
03:10:58.950 --> 03:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
03:11:03.590 --> 03:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead carol um good morning and um
 
03:11:06.469 --> 03:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you chairman dolan and all
 
03:11:07.990 --> 03:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
the members of the municipal
 
03:11:10.309 --> 03:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
and county government committee i'm
 
03:11:12.070 --> 03:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
going to speak to all three sections if
 
03:11:13.030 --> 03:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
you don't mind at the
 
03:11:15.750 --> 03:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
at this time um but i think i can
 
03:11:17.670 --> 03:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
clarify some of the questions that have
 
03:11:17.680 --> 03:11:17.990 align:start position:0%
clarify some of the questions that have
come

03:11:17.990 --> 03:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
come
 
03:11:21.030 --> 03:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
up um in part one relative to the
 
03:11:24.150 --> 03:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
creation of communication districts
 
03:11:27.429 --> 03:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
the current the current rules under 53
 
03:11:31.190 --> 03:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
g2 what are that
 
03:11:32.790 --> 03:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
in order to form the committee you had
 
03:11:34.229 --> 03:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
to go to town meeting
 
03:11:37.030 --> 03:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
in order to request to be a district to
 
03:11:38.469 --> 03:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
be approved you have to go to town
 
03:11:39.429 --> 03:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
meeting which we
 
03:11:42.710 --> 03:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
which then required a two-year or more
 
03:11:42.720 --> 03:11:44.070 align:start position:0%
which then required a two-year or more
process

03:11:44.070 --> 03:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:11:46.630 --> 03:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
this uh change allows for the committee
 
03:11:47.670 --> 03:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
to be appointed
 
03:11:52.150 --> 03:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
by the select board for the city council
 
03:11:54.070 --> 03:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee of two or more
 
03:11:56.710 --> 03:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
towns and then that committee
 
03:11:59.910 --> 03:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
will look at the reasonableness of
 
03:12:01.429 --> 03:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
creating a communication
 
03:12:04.870 --> 03:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
district and respond back to the town
 
03:12:07.030 --> 03:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
for approval at town meeting the next
 
03:12:07.910 --> 03:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
town meeting
 
03:12:10.229 --> 03:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
so the the general public does have an
 
03:12:12.550 --> 03:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in at town meeting
 
03:12:15.510 --> 03:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
on the final decision but all the work
 
03:12:16.389 --> 03:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
and planning
 
03:12:18.710 --> 03:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
and feasibility and business planning
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
will be done by the committee
 
03:12:22.710 --> 03:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
up front and that committee can be
 
03:12:23.910 --> 03:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
appointed now
 
03:12:27.030 --> 03:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
with this change by the select board
 
03:12:29.590 --> 03:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
and it makes it makes it so that it will
 
03:12:30.870 --> 03:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
go much quicker
 
03:12:34.150 --> 03:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
in the process in part two
 
03:12:35.830 --> 03:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly in support of one touch
 
03:12:38.630 --> 03:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
make ready it will simplify the process
 
03:12:40.630 --> 03:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
and yes generally speaking
 
03:12:44.309 --> 03:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
um it is one um an outsourced third
 
03:12:44.319 --> 03:12:44.950 align:start position:0%
um it is one um an outsourced third
party

03:12:44.950 --> 03:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
party
 
03:12:47.830 --> 03:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
that does the make ready work even today
 
03:12:47.840 --> 03:12:48.870 align:start position:0%
that does the make ready work even today
so

03:12:48.870 --> 03:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:12:51.750 --> 03:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
in essence this will just streamline the
 
03:12:51.760 --> 03:12:52.630 align:start position:0%
in essence this will just streamline the
process

03:12:52.630 --> 03:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:12:55.429 --> 03:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
and allow for that to be the norm
 
03:12:57.349 --> 03:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
instead of the
 
03:13:01.269 --> 03:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
instead of a possibility where one
 
03:13:04.950 --> 03:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
third party that's a third party that is
 
03:13:06.550 --> 03:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
on the list of those
 
03:13:09.110 --> 03:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
attachers on the pole will go and move
 
03:13:11.349 --> 03:13:11.359 align:start position:0%
the equipment on the poles down to make
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
ready for the new
 
03:13:16.389 --> 03:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
participant a new attacher
 
03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
it is something that's already being
 
03:13:19.670 --> 03:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
done across the country
 
03:13:22.229 --> 03:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
and it will streamline the process here
 
03:13:24.229 --> 03:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
the second part of this
 
03:13:26.309 --> 03:13:26.319 align:start position:0%
part two really has to do with the
 
03:13:28.469 --> 03:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
03:13:31.910 --> 03:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
currently the puc 1300 utility poll
 
03:13:33.510 --> 03:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
attachment rules
 
03:13:35.750 --> 03:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
include a requirement to negotiate
 
03:13:35.760 --> 03:13:36.790 align:start position:0%
include a requirement to negotiate
agreement

03:13:36.790 --> 03:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
03:13:41.190 --> 03:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
with the poll owners and this
 
03:13:44.550 --> 03:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
this particular issue is that
 
03:13:46.630 --> 03:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
you have much smaller internet service
 
03:13:49.190 --> 03:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
providers negotiating with very large
 
03:13:52.229 --> 03:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
multi-state entities and what has
 
03:13:54.150 --> 03:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
happened in the past
 
03:13:56.389 --> 03:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
is that they have held up the approval
 
03:13:56.399 --> 03:13:57.190 align:start position:0%
is that they have held up the approval
of

03:13:57.190 --> 03:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:14:00.229 --> 03:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
an agreement until you
 
03:14:03.590 --> 03:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
gave up some of the rules that have been
 
03:14:05.110 --> 03:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
established in
 
03:14:07.990 --> 03:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
chapter puc 1300 utility poll

attachments

03:14:10.229 --> 03:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
attachments
 
03:14:13.510 --> 03:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
and so to make sure that we
 
03:14:15.429 --> 03:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
all follow the existing rules
 
03:14:17.429 --> 03:14:17.439 align:start position:0%
established by the puc which might
 
03:14:19.190 --> 03:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
include one touch make ready going
 
03:14:19.200 --> 03:14:21.030 align:start position:0%
include one touch make ready going
forward

03:14:21.030 --> 03:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:14:25.269 --> 03:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that all agreements
 
03:14:28.870 --> 03:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
are agreements that follow those rules
 
03:14:31.590 --> 03:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
and not negotiating away the rules that
 
03:14:33.030 --> 03:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
have been established
 
03:14:37.349 --> 03:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:40.389 --> 03:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
part three relative to bonding issue
 
03:14:44.150 --> 03:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
um currently the timeline is 60 60 days
 
03:14:45.750 --> 03:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
to respond to an rfi
 
03:14:48.070 --> 03:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
that shortens it to 30. once again
 
03:14:50.229 --> 03:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
trying to move this process along fairly
 
03:14:50.239 --> 03:14:52.790 align:start position:0%
trying to move this process along fairly
quickly

03:14:52.790 --> 03:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:55.190 --> 03:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
and then the second piece of that is in
 
03:14:55.990 --> 03:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
the past
 
03:14:58.550 --> 03:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
the cable providers have found it
 
03:15:01.269 --> 03:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
difficult to respond to their rfi
 
03:15:03.510 --> 03:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
and in many cases did not and we
 
03:15:03.520 --> 03:15:04.469 align:start position:0%
and in many cases did not and we
remedied

03:15:04.469 --> 03:15:04.479 align:start position:0%
remedied
 
03:15:09.030 --> 03:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
put in a remedy last year that
 
03:15:11.670 --> 03:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
indicated that if they didn't respond
 
03:15:13.190 --> 03:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
then we would consider it to be an
 
03:15:16.309 --> 03:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
unserved area in town
 
03:15:19.750 --> 03:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
but in fact what they have suggested is
 
03:15:22.389 --> 03:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
that they can respond with a map
 
03:15:25.750 --> 03:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
that that can identify the first address
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
on a street
 
03:15:28.790 --> 03:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
that can reach that can receive cable
 
03:15:31.110 --> 03:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
and the last on every street in town
 
03:15:34.229 --> 03:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
so for an example you know the cable is
 
03:15:36.229 --> 03:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
available on main street from
 
03:15:39.510 --> 03:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
premises number 13 to
 
03:15:43.750 --> 03:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
premises 256 and everything in between
 
03:15:46.389 --> 03:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
but but what we've seen from the cable
 
03:15:48.150 --> 03:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
companies in this past year
 
03:15:50.870 --> 03:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
was hand-drawn maps sometimes
 
03:15:50.880 --> 03:15:51.590 align:start position:0%
was hand-drawn maps sometimes
highlighted

03:15:51.590 --> 03:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
highlighted
 
03:15:54.870 --> 03:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
with colors and
 
03:15:58.229 --> 03:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
or and or street maps which have been
 
03:15:59.190 --> 03:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
highlighted but
 
03:16:01.190 --> 03:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
but no indication of where the cable
 
03:16:03.190 --> 03:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
starts and stops and so therefore no
 
03:16:03.200 --> 03:16:04.469 align:start position:0%
starts and stops and so therefore no
indication

03:16:04.469 --> 03:16:04.479 align:start position:0%
indication
 
03:16:06.309 --> 03:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
of where there is service and where
 
03:16:07.510 --> 03:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
there is not
 
03:16:10.070 --> 03:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
and so this section just clarifies the
 
03:16:11.349 --> 03:16:11.359 align:start position:0%
need to have that very
 
03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
to have very specific addresses
 
03:16:14.239 --> 03:16:15.269 align:start position:0%
to have very specific addresses
identified

03:16:15.269 --> 03:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
identified
 
03:16:17.670 --> 03:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
as to where they have service so we can
 
03:16:17.680 --> 03:16:18.469 align:start position:0%
as to where they have service so we can
determine

03:16:18.469 --> 03:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
determine
 
03:16:21.670 --> 03:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
who is unserved in that town and so
 
03:16:23.750 --> 03:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
those are the three areas um
 
03:16:26.229 --> 03:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
within this bill and i'm happy to take
 
03:16:28.070 --> 03:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
any questions you might have
 
03:16:31.510 --> 03:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
um this is as senator khan
 
03:16:33.349 --> 03:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
represented this is really a cleanup
 
03:16:35.269 --> 03:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
bill of some
 
03:16:38.469 --> 03:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
legislation that's already in place
 
03:16:41.190 --> 03:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh ms monroe you seem to be very well
 
03:16:42.630 --> 03:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
read on this issue but
 
03:16:44.389 --> 03:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
my list of speakers just as you're
 
03:16:45.990 --> 03:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
representing yourself as a member of the
 
03:16:47.190 --> 03:16:47.200 align:start position:0%

testimony is there are any
 
03:17:24.229 --> 03:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
questions for ms monroe yes

representative porter
 
03:17:28.550 --> 03:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh miss monroe i'm
 
03:17:29.590 --> 03:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
03:17:32.469 --> 03:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
one of the problems that's come up a lot
 
03:17:34.070 --> 03:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
when we're trying to get broadband out
 
03:17:34.080 --> 03:17:34.389 align:start position:0%
when we're trying to get broadband out
to

03:17:34.389 --> 03:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:17:37.590 --> 03:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
especially rural areas is that last mile
 
03:17:40.389 --> 03:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
issue you know where where i lived for a
 
03:17:41.590 --> 03:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
long time we had
 
03:17:45.429 --> 03:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:48.309 --> 03:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
does this address that in any way i mean
 
03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just not familiar enough with the
 
03:17:49.840 --> 03:17:51.190 align:start position:0%
i'm just not familiar enough with the
technology

03:17:51.190 --> 03:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
technology
 
03:17:54.630 --> 03:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
and the issue so the the uh problem with
 
03:17:55.990 --> 03:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
getting to the last mile
 
03:17:57.830 --> 03:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
to that last address at the end of the
 
03:17:59.670 --> 03:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
dirt road a mile up
 
03:18:02.229 --> 03:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
um in new hampshire it's very common and
 
03:18:02.239 --> 03:18:03.030 align:start position:0%
um in new hampshire it's very common and
across

03:18:03.030 --> 03:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
across
 
03:18:05.510 --> 03:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
northern new england um is the cost of
 
03:18:06.389 --> 03:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
doing so
 
03:18:08.309 --> 03:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
and the then the fact that there are
 
03:18:08.319 --> 03:18:09.429 align:start position:0%
and the then the fact that there are
only

03:18:09.429 --> 03:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:18:12.630 --> 03:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
five to six houses per mile in those
 
03:18:14.790 --> 03:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
areas and so the costs
 
03:18:17.750 --> 03:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
spread over those few numbers are are
 
03:18:17.760 --> 03:18:18.710 align:start position:0%
spread over those few numbers are are
higher

03:18:18.710 --> 03:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
higher
 
03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
however when you form a communication
 
03:18:22.950 --> 03:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
district and you bring together
 
03:18:26.150 --> 03:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
all small towns and larger towns
 
03:18:29.349 --> 03:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
then you're you're aggregating
 
03:18:32.389 --> 03:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
that demand across a larger footprint
 
03:18:35.830 --> 03:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
and so that costs will go down because
 
03:18:37.830 --> 03:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
some areas will be a higher density in
 
03:18:40.630 --> 03:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
some areas a lower density
 
03:18:43.429 --> 03:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
so that's one item there the second is
 
03:18:45.510 --> 03:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
communication districts
 
03:18:49.030 --> 03:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
by by their nature are are about
 
03:18:52.950 --> 03:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
universal access meaning access to all
 
03:18:56.070 --> 03:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
not just to those that are
 
03:18:57.990 --> 03:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
in which you can have a return on
 
03:19:00.710 --> 03:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
investment as a municipal communication
 
03:19:00.720 --> 03:19:02.630 align:start position:0%
investment as a municipal communication
district

03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:19:04.870 --> 03:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
your you're less concerned about your
 
03:19:06.710 --> 03:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
return on your investment
 
03:19:09.429 --> 03:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
than you are about getting service to
 
03:19:09.439 --> 03:19:09.990 align:start position:0%
than you are about getting service to
every

03:19:09.990 --> 03:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
every
 
03:19:13.990 --> 03:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
resident in your community every premise
 
03:19:16.870 --> 03:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
in your community um so by nature by
 
03:19:17.990 --> 03:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
that nature
 
03:19:19.830 --> 03:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
you're looking at universal access and
 
03:19:22.790 --> 03:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's the goal is to get to there
 
03:19:25.910 --> 03:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
and that that plays into
 
03:19:28.950 --> 03:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
the ability to bond for those
 
03:19:31.990 --> 03:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the ability to attach to the polls
 
03:19:34.150 --> 03:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
in a very timely manner
 
03:19:37.030 --> 03:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
at a much lower cost as well as the
 
03:19:40.389 --> 03:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
creation of the district itself
 
03:19:43.190 --> 03:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your follow-up to follow
 
03:19:44.630 --> 03:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
up on that
 
03:19:47.030 --> 03:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
when these districts are formed and the
 
03:19:48.389 --> 03:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
broadband eventually
 
03:19:51.910 --> 03:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
gets installed is the cost to the met
 
03:19:53.110 --> 03:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
the people who
 
03:19:56.070 --> 03:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
have now have broadband the thing
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they live within the
 
03:19:58.080 --> 03:19:59.030 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they live within the
district

03:19:59.030 --> 03:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:20:01.030 --> 03:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
so is my neighbor who lives three miles
 
03:20:02.309 --> 03:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
down the dirt road
 
03:20:05.269 --> 03:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
going to pay the same monthly fee as i
 
03:20:05.279 --> 03:20:05.590 align:start position:0%
going to pay the same monthly fee as i
do

03:20:05.590 --> 03:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:20:09.030 --> 03:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
that lives in town yes absolutely
 
03:20:10.870 --> 03:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
i mean that's one of the purposes of the
 
03:20:12.870 --> 03:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
district is so that the costs are the
 
03:20:12.880 --> 03:20:13.670 align:start position:0%
district is so that the costs are the
same

03:20:13.670 --> 03:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
same
 
03:20:18.389 --> 03:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:20.950 --> 03:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have anybody else
 
03:20:22.710 --> 03:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
online from the senate who would like to
 
03:20:23.670 --> 03:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
talk to section
 
03:20:30.070 --> 03:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:33.510 --> 03:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you the uh the only action that

i see
 
03:20:36.790 --> 03:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
that i made note of was that senator
 
03:20:37.990 --> 03:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
bradley mentioned in
 
03:20:41.349 --> 03:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
part two that he thought that the
 
03:20:44.870 --> 03:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
effective effectivity had to be changed
 
03:20:44.880 --> 03:20:45.269 align:start position:0%
effective effectivity had to be changed
from

03:20:45.269 --> 03:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:20:47.590 --> 03:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
60 days after the passage to immediately
 
03:20:48.950 --> 03:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
after passing
 
03:20:54.830 --> 03:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:54.840 --> 03:20:56.309 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:22:02.550 --> 03:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
are new hampshire's leading broadband
 
03:22:04.630 --> 03:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
and communications providers
 
03:22:07.830 --> 03:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire with over 450 000
 
03:22:12.150 --> 03:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
customers in more than 184 communities
 
03:22:14.309 --> 03:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
our members are proud to be the first
 
03:22:16.309 --> 03:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
providers to offer gigabit speeds
 
03:22:19.429 --> 03:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
throughout their networks my comments
 
03:22:21.429 --> 03:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
today are specifically focused on part
 
03:22:21.439 --> 03:22:22.389 align:start position:0%
today are specifically focused on part
three

03:22:22.389 --> 03:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:22:25.510 --> 03:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 88 and we do
 
03:22:29.110 --> 03:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
support the bill the language
 
03:22:30.790 --> 03:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
in part three of senate bill 88
 
03:22:33.269 --> 03:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
streamlines and makes more efficient
 
03:22:35.990 --> 03:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
the rfi process relative to the issuance
 
03:22:37.670 --> 03:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
of bonds for financing broadband
 
03:22:37.680 --> 03:22:39.110 align:start position:0%
of bonds for financing broadband
infrastructure

03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
03:22:41.510 --> 03:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
rfis are required by statute so the
 
03:22:42.950 --> 03:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
communities can determine for the
 
03:22:45.110 --> 03:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of issuing an rfp
 
03:22:48.070 --> 03:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
what locations in town are unserved
 
03:22:50.229 --> 03:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
specifically the rfi process is
 
03:22:51.590 --> 03:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
recruited by this bill in two very
 
03:22:53.349 --> 03:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
important ways
 
03:22:56.150 --> 03:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
first the bill creates an interested
 
03:22:57.269 --> 03:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
provider list by
 
03:22:59.990 --> 03:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
town maintained by the office office of
 
03:23:01.670 --> 03:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives
 
03:23:04.070 --> 03:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
such that those issuing rfis will have
 
03:23:06.150 --> 03:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
the correct contact information
 
03:23:08.630 --> 03:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
for all interested providers this will
 
03:23:09.750 --> 03:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
limit confusion
 
03:23:12.070 --> 03:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
or lack of response when a town
 
03:23:14.469 --> 03:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
unintentionally fails to issue an rfi to
 
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
a provider
 
03:23:17.429 --> 03:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
in their town or they issue it to the
 
03:23:19.349 --> 03:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
wrong employee or the wrong
 
03:23:23.190 --> 03:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
address secondly the bill clarifies what
 
03:23:25.429 --> 03:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
information providers are required
 
03:23:28.710 --> 03:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
to include in their responses to rfi
 
03:23:31.190 --> 03:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
these two changes in law update the rfi
 
03:23:33.269 --> 03:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
process allowing for more timely
 
03:23:36.150 --> 03:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
and informative responses i would
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
however like to draw your attention to
 
03:23:38.630 --> 03:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
what we believe
 
03:23:41.910 --> 03:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
is a drafting error on line
 
03:23:44.950 --> 03:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
33 of page
 
03:23:44.960 --> 03:23:49.190 align:start position:0%
33 of page
2.

03:23:49.190 --> 03:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:52.630 --> 03:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:54.309 --> 03:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
the the intention of this section is
 
03:23:56.630 --> 03:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
that when a town issues an rfp
 
03:23:58.469 --> 03:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
after having collected information and
 
03:23:59.670 --> 03:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
data through the rfi
 
03:24:02.150 --> 03:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
process that town will identify which
 
03:24:03.349 --> 03:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
street segments
 
03:24:05.990 --> 03:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
have been unserviceable so that
 
03:24:07.269 --> 03:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
providers will know what the
 
03:24:09.910 --> 03:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
municipality is proposing to build
 
03:24:12.870 --> 03:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
so we believe that the correct term in
 
03:24:15.110 --> 03:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
that line should be
 
03:24:21.269 --> 03:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:23.429 --> 03:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
and we're happy to to provide more
 
03:24:23.439 --> 03:24:24.469 align:start position:0%
and we're happy to to provide more
specific

03:24:24.469 --> 03:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
specific
 
03:24:25.990 --> 03:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
language or markup but i think that
 
03:24:28.229 --> 03:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
that's a drafting error
 
03:24:30.150 --> 03:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
so we appreciate the opportunity to work
 
03:24:32.790 --> 03:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
with the sponsors and the stakeholders
 
03:24:35.269 --> 03:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
although this bill may not be perfect
 
03:24:36.950 --> 03:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
from every perspective
 
03:24:39.190 --> 03:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
it reflects negotiations and compromise
 
03:24:41.349 --> 03:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
reached by parties who came together
 
03:24:42.870 --> 03:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
with a shared goal of addressing the
 
03:24:44.950 --> 03:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
challenges of broadband deployment
 
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
for the greater good in new hampshire
 
03:24:48.309 --> 03:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
and we certainly appreciate the
 
03:24:50.309 --> 03:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today
 
03:24:52.389 --> 03:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
03:24:54.630 --> 03:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
you might have
 
03:24:57.990 --> 03:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee yes
 
03:25:01.030 --> 03:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher um
 
03:25:04.309 --> 03:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
so with the um
 
03:25:06.950 --> 03:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
list being maintained by the office of
 
03:25:09.590 --> 03:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
street future initiatives
 
03:25:12.710 --> 03:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
so if um
 
03:25:16.070 --> 03:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
if governor sununu's plan to split
 
03:25:18.389 --> 03:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
the office and reorganize it goes
 
03:25:20.830 --> 03:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
through do you know
 
03:25:23.990 --> 03:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
um what what will happen to
 
03:25:27.190 --> 03:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
like which half of the office the
 
03:25:29.910 --> 03:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
list will go with where where that those
 
03:25:32.229 --> 03:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities will fall
 
03:25:35.190 --> 03:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
i imagine i i don't have an answer for
 
03:25:36.710 --> 03:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
for you specifically
 
03:25:40.150 --> 03:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
um you know we had thought and
 
03:25:41.590 --> 03:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
working with the sponsors thought that
 
03:25:43.830 --> 03:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
osi was an appropriate place to kind of
 
03:25:44.790 --> 03:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
house this
 
03:25:47.590 --> 03:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
list and i imagine in the reorganization
 
03:25:47.600 --> 03:25:48.309 align:start position:0%
list and i imagine in the reorganization
process

03:25:48.309 --> 03:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:25:50.309 --> 03:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
it would follow to the new department of
 
03:25:50.319 --> 03:25:51.349 align:start position:0%
it would follow to the new department of
energy

03:25:51.349 --> 03:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:25:53.990 --> 03:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
um if that's created if certainly there
 
03:25:55.110 --> 03:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be a tweak
 
03:25:57.510 --> 03:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
um we'd be happy to work on it to make
 
03:25:58.389 --> 03:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
03:26:01.349 --> 03:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
um there is a predictable process in
 
03:26:02.389 --> 03:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
place that
 
03:26:05.349 --> 03:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
that continues along regardless of what
 
03:26:06.950 --> 03:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
happens with with the office
 
03:26:08.630 --> 03:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
and the potential formation of the
 
03:26:12.309 --> 03:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:17.349 --> 03:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr preston uh we have a
 
03:26:19.750 --> 03:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
request to speak from uh mr isaac are
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
you with us mr isaac
 
03:26:24.710 --> 03:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you can you hear me yes great
 
03:26:27.030 --> 03:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
well thank you chairman nolan and uh
 
03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
03:26:30.469 --> 03:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh i'm a member of the general public
 
03:26:31.830 --> 03:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
and not one of the
 
03:26:34.950 --> 03:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
representatives of any organization or
 
03:26:36.950 --> 03:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
commercial interests but i have a very
 
03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
strong interest in broadband
 
03:26:40.550 --> 03:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
and the ability for having affordable
 
03:26:42.630 --> 03:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
access across all of new hampshire
 
03:26:45.510 --> 03:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's a passion of mine for literally 50
 
03:26:45.520 --> 03:26:46.630 align:start position:0%
it's a passion of mine for literally 50
years

03:26:46.630 --> 03:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:26:50.070 --> 03:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
in various ways that i've worked on
 
03:26:52.229 --> 03:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
i really support this bill very strongly
 
03:26:53.910 --> 03:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to really focus on section
 
03:26:55.269 --> 03:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
3 because i think it does one thing
 
03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's very important
 
03:26:58.150 --> 03:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
and then this is one thing that i think
 
03:27:00.469 --> 03:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
is also important they're really two
 
03:27:02.630 --> 03:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
serious issues we face with incumbent
 
03:27:02.640 --> 03:27:03.750 align:start position:0%
serious issues we face with incumbent
suppliers

03:27:03.750 --> 03:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
suppliers
 
03:27:05.269 --> 03:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
and they're to put a bluntly
 
03:27:06.950 --> 03:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
unwillingness to actually provide
 
03:27:10.469 --> 03:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
service uh their purpose of course is to
 
03:27:12.070 --> 03:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
make money which makes perfect sense
 
03:27:12.630 --> 03:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
they're pri
 
03:27:12.640 --> 03:27:16.070 align:start position:0%
they're pri
for

03:27:16.070 --> 03:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:18.229 --> 03:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
and as soon as they run to situations
 
03:27:19.830 --> 03:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
where that no longer makes sense it's
 
03:27:21.750 --> 03:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
hard for them to justify taking action
 
03:27:23.110 --> 03:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
to provide service
 
03:27:26.389 --> 03:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
so there needs to be a way for towns
 
03:27:28.469 --> 03:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
to determine what level service they
 
03:27:29.990 --> 03:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
actually need
 
03:27:31.910 --> 03:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
and this really is a local control issue
 
03:27:34.389 --> 03:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
in my mind towns do zoning towns do
 
03:27:35.990 --> 03:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
school type activities
 
03:27:38.309 --> 03:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
they decide the personality broadband
 
03:27:39.830 --> 03:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
has become an infrastructure
 
03:27:41.590 --> 03:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
that's critical for towns to determine
 
03:27:43.990 --> 03:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
their own personalities
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
in a rapidly changed area 20 years ago
 
03:27:51.349 --> 03:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
this was not really an issue and
 
03:27:53.590 --> 03:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
right now it's almost inconceivable that
 
03:27:55.590 --> 03:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
towns don't take a proactive role in
 
03:27:55.600 --> 03:27:56.309 align:start position:0%
towns don't take a proactive role in
thinking

03:27:56.309 --> 03:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
03:27:58.630 --> 03:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
what should we have do we have it do we
 
03:28:00.070 --> 03:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
not have it
 
03:28:02.229 --> 03:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
so with that context let me point to the
 
03:28:03.990 --> 03:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
specifics in the bill
 
03:28:06.870 --> 03:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
the concept of actually having detailed
 
03:28:06.880 --> 03:28:07.830 align:start position:0%
the concept of actually having detailed
information

03:28:07.830 --> 03:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:28:09.670 --> 03:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
about which addresses are served or
 
03:28:09.680 --> 03:28:10.950 align:start position:0%
about which addresses are served or
unserved

03:28:10.950 --> 03:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
unserved
 
03:28:12.469 --> 03:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
and for every address in town i'll just
 
03:28:14.389 --> 03:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
point out that's one way or the other
 
03:28:17.510 --> 03:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's either served or unserved and
 
03:28:19.349 --> 03:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
so it really doesn't matter whether a
 
03:28:20.790 --> 03:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
incumbent supplier
 
03:28:23.030 --> 03:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
basically documents every served address
 
03:28:25.190 --> 03:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
or documents every unserved address
 
03:28:27.269 --> 03:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
the key thing is the town needs to know
 
03:28:28.630 --> 03:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
where the service goes and where it
 
03:28:28.640 --> 03:28:29.830 align:start position:0%
where the service goes and where it
stops

03:28:29.830 --> 03:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
stops
 
03:28:32.710 --> 03:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
and i think the by address definition is
 
03:28:34.790 --> 03:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
a very important one
 
03:28:36.469 --> 03:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
the second thing which is not addressed
 
03:28:38.309 --> 03:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
here directly
 
03:28:39.910 --> 03:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
is the problem of what what does it mean
 
03:28:41.910 --> 03:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
to be served
 
03:28:44.870 --> 03:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
the current fcc specification is 25
 
03:28:46.070 --> 03:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
megabits down
 
03:28:48.150 --> 03:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
three megabits up that's barely
 
03:28:49.590 --> 03:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
sufficient in fact it's so
 
03:28:51.750 --> 03:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
insufficient the comcast recently
 
03:28:54.229 --> 03:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
upgraded their essential service for
 
03:28:57.349 --> 03:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
um low-income houses to be 50 down and
 
03:28:57.359 --> 03:28:57.750 align:start position:0%
um low-income houses to be 50 down and
five

03:28:57.750 --> 03:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
five
 
03:29:00.630 --> 03:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
up at their 10 a month rate i don't
 
03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
think that's at
 
03:29:03.750 --> 03:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
cost so i appreciate their willingness
 
03:29:04.630 --> 03:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
03:29:06.710 --> 03:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
but it also reflects the kind of level
 
03:29:08.389 --> 03:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
of service that's needed to provide
 
03:29:08.399 --> 03:29:09.110 align:start position:0%
of service that's needed to provide
viable

03:29:09.110 --> 03:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
viable
 
03:29:12.630 --> 03:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
service today in that context again i
 
03:29:14.389 --> 03:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
hope towns would have the ability to
 
03:29:16.150 --> 03:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
specify what they think
 
03:29:18.630 --> 03:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
adequate service is and not settle for
 
03:29:19.750 --> 03:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
whatever the fcc
 
03:29:21.910 --> 03:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
has done some towns will be very happy
 
03:29:23.910 --> 03:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
with whatever the essay is specified
 
03:29:25.590 --> 03:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
or very happy potentially with what
 
03:29:27.510 --> 03:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
their incumbent suppliers are doing
 
03:29:29.429 --> 03:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
others will find that inadequate to meet
 
03:29:32.229 --> 03:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
their uh objectives for education
 
03:29:34.150 --> 03:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
for employment uh for the kind of
 
03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
industry they might attract and so forth
 
03:29:39.590 --> 03:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
um in that respect i'd be very tempted
 
03:29:41.349 --> 03:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
to make one change and i realize you're
 
03:29:42.950 --> 03:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
really not in a position to do this
 
03:29:45.269 --> 03:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
but i'll just mention it anyway which is
 
03:29:46.630 --> 03:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
to change unserved
 
03:29:50.469 --> 03:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
to underserved you can have service at
 
03:29:52.790 --> 03:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
25 30 or at least a vendor who claims to
 
03:29:53.990 --> 03:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
have service at 25
 
03:29:56.710 --> 03:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
30 and still have an underserved
 
03:29:56.720 --> 03:29:57.830 align:start position:0%
30 and still have an underserved
community

03:29:57.830 --> 03:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:30:00.309 --> 03:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
to meet the town's objectives uh it's
 
03:30:01.269 --> 03:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
pointed out in
 
03:30:04.710 --> 03:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
billy senate bill 85 that the objective
 
03:30:05.590 --> 03:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:30:07.910 --> 03:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
state in that context is targeting a
 
03:30:07.920 --> 03:30:08.950 align:start position:0%
state in that context is targeting a
gigabit

03:30:08.950 --> 03:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
gigabit
 
03:30:11.750 --> 03:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
which is an excellent target but it's
 
03:30:13.349 --> 03:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
certainly not
 
03:30:16.389 --> 03:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
going to be a unserved community
 
03:30:19.510 --> 03:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh that's an underserved situation where
 
03:30:22.630 --> 03:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
25 3 might be served but not sufficient
 
03:30:23.910 --> 03:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
to meet the town or
 
03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:31.269 --> 03:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
so i'll point that out and uh i'd be
 
03:30:32.870 --> 03:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions i might
 
03:30:35.910 --> 03:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
that you might have for me thank you
 
03:30:40.070 --> 03:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um mr isaac thank you
 
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
take my question what line were you
 
03:30:49.110 --> 03:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:51.030 --> 03:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm having trouble hearing i'm sorry
 
03:30:53.269 --> 03:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
that it's breaking up
 
03:31:02.790 --> 03:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:05.030 --> 03:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
i still did not get the question i'm
 
03:31:05.040 --> 03:31:06.309 align:start position:0%
i still did not get the question i'm
sorry

03:31:06.309 --> 03:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:31:08.229 --> 03:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
what what line of the bill were you
 
03:31:10.469 --> 03:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
looking for a change
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh well to put it bluntly it's not just
 
03:31:14.550 --> 03:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:31:17.030 --> 03:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh the definition of service actually
 
03:31:18.710 --> 03:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
goes back to rsas that are already in
 
03:31:18.720 --> 03:31:19.510 align:start position:0%
goes back to rsas that are already in
present

03:31:19.510 --> 03:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
present
 
03:31:21.590 --> 03:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh that reference fcc guidelines for
 
03:31:23.349 --> 03:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
what defines service
 
03:31:27.429 --> 03:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
uh so it would be essentially replacing
 
03:31:30.790 --> 03:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
served uh areas with un under
 
03:31:34.389 --> 03:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
unserved areas with underserved areas
 
03:31:36.710 --> 03:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
in this bill but also in other
 
03:31:36.720 --> 03:31:37.990 align:start position:0%
in this bill but also in other
legislation

03:31:37.990 --> 03:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:31:39.910 --> 03:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
which is probably beyond the scope of
 
03:31:41.269 --> 03:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
this bill so
 
03:31:43.030 --> 03:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
i would love to see it done but i don't
 
03:31:44.309 --> 03:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
know that you actually are in a position
 
03:31:45.030 --> 03:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
03:31:46.870 --> 03:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
at this point are there any other
 
03:31:49.110 --> 03:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
questions for mr isaac
 
03:31:50.950 --> 03:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
from the committee uh yes representative
 
03:31:50.960 --> 03:31:52.790 align:start position:0%
from the committee uh yes representative
gallagher

03:31:52.790 --> 03:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
gallagher
 
03:31:56.389 --> 03:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
yeah um just wondering um did you also
 
03:31:59.510 --> 03:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
email testimony to us previously are you
 
03:32:00.389 --> 03:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
that same jim
 
03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
isaac yes that's me okay
 
03:32:06.870 --> 03:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
um in the email you said you were with
 
03:32:10.150 --> 03:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
the ieee but now you're saying
 
03:32:12.229 --> 03:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
that you're not with any organization
 
03:32:13.590 --> 03:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
could you clarify
 
03:32:16.389 --> 03:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
that for us i have a great deal of
 
03:32:18.710 --> 03:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
expertise having worked with ieee
 
03:32:21.030 --> 03:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
as a volunteer for many years including
 
03:32:22.790 --> 03:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
chairing the communications
 
03:32:25.510 --> 03:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
policy committee but it is not an ieee
 
03:32:25.520 --> 03:32:26.550 align:start position:0%
policy committee but it is not an ieee
position

03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:32:29.429 --> 03:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh that i represent here it's my own
 
03:32:30.950 --> 03:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
personal position
 
03:32:34.950 --> 03:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay thanks okay and uh
 
03:32:37.990 --> 03:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
we had senator ward uh queued up
 
03:32:40.389 --> 03:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
to talk to us about section relative
 
03:32:41.990 --> 03:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
part three of the bill
 
03:32:45.670 --> 03:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
but because of our our schedule here
 
03:32:47.830 --> 03:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
she was unable to stay but she did send
 
03:32:55.910 --> 03:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:58.950 --> 03:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
she says part three improves upon the
 
03:33:01.190 --> 03:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
process that municipalities must adhere
 
03:33:01.200 --> 03:33:01.510 align:start position:0%
process that municipalities must adhere
to

03:33:01.510 --> 03:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:33:03.670 --> 03:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
in order to issue bonds for the purpose
 
03:33:05.030 --> 03:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
of financing
 
03:33:07.830 --> 03:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
the development of broadbrand
 
03:33:07.840 --> 03:33:09.190 align:start position:0%
the development of broadbrand
infrastructure

03:33:09.190 --> 03:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
03:33:12.469 --> 03:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
additionally it instructs the office of
 
03:33:14.229 --> 03:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives
 
03:33:16.389 --> 03:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
to maintain a list of all providers by
 
03:33:18.710 --> 03:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
town interested in receiving requests
 
03:33:20.389 --> 03:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
for information
 
03:33:24.550 --> 03:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
just a short two sentence
 
03:33:27.750 --> 03:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
email so that's in the record from
 
03:33:31.750 --> 03:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
senator ward who was the uh
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
sponsor section for around part three
 
03:33:37.510 --> 03:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions or
 
03:33:37.520 --> 03:33:38.790 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions or
comments

03:33:38.790 --> 03:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
comments
 
03:33:40.950 --> 03:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
are always interesting mr chair i would
 
03:33:42.950 --> 03:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
only know that uh well we've done two
 
03:33:42.960 --> 03:33:43.269 align:start position:0%
only know that uh well we've done two
things

03:33:43.269 --> 03:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:33:46.870 --> 03:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative oxham has uh has a hand
 
03:33:48.070 --> 03:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
up and i had a
 
03:33:49.830 --> 03:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
question going back maybe for our
 
03:33:51.429 --> 03:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
03:33:52.950 --> 03:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
about the the difference between
 
03:33:56.150 --> 03:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
serviceable and unserviceable
 
03:33:59.910 --> 03:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh in there that i was hoping to ask a
 
03:34:02.309 --> 03:34:02.319 align:start position:0%
moral question but i think it might be
 
03:34:04.229 --> 03:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
proven to go to representative box in
 
03:34:04.239 --> 03:34:05.030 align:start position:0%
proven to go to representative box in
first

03:34:05.030 --> 03:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:34:05.040 --> 03:34:08.870 align:start position:0%
first
sure

03:34:08.870 --> 03:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:12.469 --> 03:34:12.479 align:start position:0%

03:34:16.469 --> 03:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:30.229 --> 03:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:32.550 --> 03:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
there i finally achieved it thank you
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
very much for taking my
 
03:34:37.510 --> 03:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
very brief comment um i also have a um
 
03:34:39.830 --> 03:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
house bill uh dealing with broadband
 
03:34:42.070 --> 03:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
which has been retained in the science
 
03:34:45.269 --> 03:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee and i'd
 
03:34:47.910 --> 03:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
like to be involved and i'd like to have
 
03:34:49.990 --> 03:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
our committee involved if we possibly
 
03:34:50.950 --> 03:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
can be
 
03:34:54.309 --> 03:34:54.319 align:start position:0%
i know it's at a very late date
 
03:34:57.269 --> 03:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
but i think that the the general goal
 
03:34:57.279 --> 03:34:57.750 align:start position:0%
but i think that the the general goal
here

03:34:57.750 --> 03:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:35:00.469 --> 03:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
is uh completely congruent we're all
 
03:35:00.479 --> 03:35:01.030 align:start position:0%
is uh completely congruent we're all
looking

03:35:01.030 --> 03:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
looking
 
03:35:03.990 --> 03:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
for the achievement of universal access
 
03:35:04.950 --> 03:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
to broadband
 
03:35:07.590 --> 03:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
for our constituents so i strongly
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
support the bill before you
 
03:35:12.790 --> 03:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
i would suggest one change where
 
03:35:16.469 --> 03:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
it specifies osi i would say
 
03:35:20.870 --> 03:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
or its successor agency
 
03:35:23.670 --> 03:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
agency may not be the best term there
 
03:35:23.680 --> 03:35:24.389 align:start position:0%
agency may not be the best term there
but

03:35:24.389 --> 03:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:35:26.630 --> 03:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
i i know i have consulted with ols and
 
03:35:29.670 --> 03:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
they won't allow us to change to do
 
03:35:32.950 --> 03:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
because doe doesn't exist yet but we
 
03:35:33.830 --> 03:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
03:35:37.110 --> 03:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
um incorporate into law that we have to
 
03:35:39.190 --> 03:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
do something with an agency that's not
 
03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
no longer going to exist so that's all i
