committee today i'm representative tim
lang

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
lang
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
from belknap four
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
i'm appearing for you to introduce house
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill 220 establishing medical freedoms
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
i will say that
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
the title is a little uh
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
misleading the idea is that
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
establishing that in the state of new
 
00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire new hampshire citizens have
 
00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
the inalienable right
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
to bodily integrity free from threat
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
from or compulsion that person accept
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
any medical intervention and that
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
includes any music immunizations
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
um this bill is fairly simple well it's
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
one simple paragraph however it's a
 
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
far-reaching bill
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
um but i i would say that this bill has
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
something for everybody
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
um that by establishing this principle
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
um we we look at liberty right the right
 
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
of an individual person have bodily
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
integrity i control my body
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
so if you believe in that that you have
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
individual freedoms and and it extends
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
to your body then you have something if
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
you're a proponent of my body my choice
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
then you have there's something here for
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
you as well
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
that you get to choose what happens to
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
your body and the state cannot mandate
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh some uh that you do any kind of
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
medical procedure and and furthermore
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
you can't be discriminated against for
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
this bill was brought forward i serve on
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
jal carmen my third term in the house
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
i'm serving my third term on job car and
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
last year we saw uh last year here
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
before i don't really call it be honest
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
with you i think was last year
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
we saw a rule being brought forward
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
through dhhs that would require
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
in order to be foster parents
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
when the question of religious freedom
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
came up or individual choice came up
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
the department basically said it doesn't
 
00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:28.949 align:start position:0%
the department basically said it doesn't
matter

00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
um and i felt this was and that the
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
parents wouldn't qualify to be a foster
 
00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:34.550 align:start position:0%
parents wouldn't qualify to be a foster
parent

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
um now i can understand in certain
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances where you may have a
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
foster child who might be have some um
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
compromised immunization system i mean
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i can say the word apologize um
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
immediately compromised immunity and
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
therefore you may want to put them with
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
parents who are
 
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.630 align:start position:0%
parents who are
um

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinated however in this case that
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't even the case this was going to
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
be a blanket statement and some
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
religions and some people truly are
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
either they can't do their religious
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
preference have uh immunizations or by
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
their personal choice can have
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
immunizations and if they qualify in any
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
other way for a state program that
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
program with the exception of this
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
immunization based on either their
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
choice or their religious
 
00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.949 align:start position:0%
choice or their religious
beliefs

00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
beliefs
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
they would be allowed to have a foster
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
child but because of their religious
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
beliefs now they're being exempted from
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
and discriminated against by the state
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
and not allowed to be foster parents and
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
i found this to be reprehensible and and
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
inconceivable be honest with you a more
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
nuanced bill was deaf or more nuanced
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
rule was needed but it was passed and
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
that's the law that's the regulation now
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
and i felt that we should not be doing
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
that so i brought this bill forward um
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
there's gonna be lots of people i'm sure
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
that want to talk including uh uh
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner tilly who i know
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
very well for my work on the reopening
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
task force
 
00:10:58.079 --> 00:10:58.949 align:start position:0%
task force
um

00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
but i'll leave you with this
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
we can yeah about this bill to death and
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
what if this bill to death
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is do you believe
 
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
that an individual has the right to
 
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.990 align:start position:0%
that an individual has the right to
choose

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
choose
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
what they get poked with what they cut
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
open with that and that the state can
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
never mandate
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
um or force a medical uh procedure on an
 
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
individual or you don't it comes down to
 
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.430 align:start position:0%
individual or you don't it comes down to
that

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
um and i i believe that i have the right
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
or every individual state in hampshire
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
has the right to make that choice and
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
that the state if i choose whatever
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
medical procedure i want which or not
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
choose that procedure the state can't
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
discriminate against me
 
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.470 align:start position:0%
discriminate against me
again

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
i'll leave a lot of the questions for
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
anybody else but i'll answer any
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
questions anybody may have but i believe
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
this is a fundamental
 
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.389 align:start position:0%
this is a fundamental
right

00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
um of bodily integrity
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
i mean we require police officers to get
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
search warrants to search people houses
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
and yet we're gonna allow the state to
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
mandate uh what you do medically i i
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
think that's wrong and i think that um
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
this bill would correct that problem and
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
make sure it never is a problem in our
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
in our in our great state of new
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm happy to take any
 
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.590 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm happy to take any
questions

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.389 align:start position:0%
questions
i

00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
left my
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
in the car whereby i normally get
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
appraised as to what members of the
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
committee wish to ask a question so i'm
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
going to rely on
 
00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
representative weber to tell me who of
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%

followed by i'm hoping you're writing
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
this down representative clerk
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
and the chair first calls on
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you very
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
much representative for taking my
 
00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:57.670 align:start position:0%
much representative for taking my
question

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
i absolutely agree that everybody has
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
the right to control what happens to
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
their body what about my right if i am
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
hiring somebody
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
to come and look after me during an
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
illness i'm hiring a part-time employee
 
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.710 align:start position:0%
illness i'm hiring a part-time employee
um

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
it appears to me that this bill would it
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
not bar
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
my saying that the person who comes to
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
look after me who might look after other
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
people in their homes as well
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
has to have a vaccination before they
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
before i hire them
 
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
so if your question is does this extend
 
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
into private industry the answer is
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
written yes it does that wasn't my
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill and i did it did come
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
to me and i'm i'm happy to help and work
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
with anybody on the amendment my intent
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
was to borrow the state
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
from uh mandating um and and
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
discriminating individual businesses i
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
think have the right to determine their
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
own hiring practices and should um again
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
a a as a business i especially see this
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
in a healthcare field where if i was
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
working in a cancer ward
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
then having immunizations would be
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
extremely important so i believe the
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
business has the right my justification
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that however i don't
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
think the state has the right i should
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
not have to have a a special card to
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
show up to dmv to get my driver's
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
license because the state mandated
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
something i'm more concerned about the
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
state mandating my participation in in
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
society rather than i am the individual
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
businesses individual business will be
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
taken care of through the free market
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
practice and employment practices of a
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
business makes an employment practice
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
that a majority of people disagree with
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
no one's going to go work for that
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
business the business will adjust its
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
practices so i'd be happy to work with
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
anybody on an amendment um to clean this
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
to make it so it's more clear that this
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
is intended that the state cannot
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
mandate um any kind of medical
 
00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:50.069 align:start position:0%
mandate um any kind of medical
intervention

00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative canark
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
representative weber just asked
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
precisely the question i was going to
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%

likewise you partially answered my
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
original question but i have another
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:18.230 align:start position:0%
if the intention of your bill

if the intention of your bill
[Music]

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
is not directed at businesses
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
how would this play out with school
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
districts or private schools or day
 
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.990 align:start position:0%
districts or private schools or day
cares

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
cares
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
who feel that it's in everyone's best
 
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.710 align:start position:0%
who feel that it's in everyone's best
interest

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
mandate vaccinations for children who
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
are attending
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
thank you representative spiro for that
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
question again so currently it's kind of
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
a this is a i want to call a chicken and
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
egg but i'm not sure what else to call
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
it um currently we have certain mandated
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
mandated vaccines for a public school
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
however we also have a complete
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
exemption process
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
that allows parents to exempt out of
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
that so we in theory don't have a
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
mandated vaccine program
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
most vaccinations are given my
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
understanding i got four kids and some
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
are my my wife controls the vaccinations
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
and she's believed in some didn't
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
believe in others
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
so we occasionally had to sign the form
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
that said that our children were not
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
vaccinated um and allowed them to attend
 
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.350 align:start position:0%
vaccinated um and allowed them to attend
uh

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
but i guess what i'm gonna say to you is
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
again we most decisions to vaccinate are
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
done at an early age i think majority of
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
the vaccines are given under the age of
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
three not at the age of school
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
um and so i i don't know that this will
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
have any impact on the percentage of
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
people that get vaccinated i don't think
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
any parent when the kids 2 says oh i
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
need to send my kid to public schools so
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
i'm going to get them vaccinated they
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
get a vaccination they get vaccinated
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
based on their conversation with their
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
doctor it's a choice it's the decision
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
between the parent and the doctor having
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
that discussion and and we have a high
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
rate of uh of
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh i'll use the word compliance i'm not
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
sure the word to use
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
but we have a high degree of
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
vaccinations in the state of new
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i don't expect that to
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
change even if this bill passes
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear that
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
um your the intention of this bill is
 
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.789 align:start position:0%
um your the intention of this bill is
not

00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
given that there's an exemption for
 
00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:24.230 align:start position:0%
given that there's an exemption for
schools

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinations for students in schools
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
your intention is not to change that but
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
my intention is to make sure the state
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
can't mandate vaccines
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh or actually my intent is any medical
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
procedure um that the state cannot step
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
in i'm trying to future proof this bill
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
because i don't like coming back and
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
tweaking bills if we can help it um
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
but my uh my intention is to future
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
proof this bill and say any medical
 
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
intervention state can't mandate um and
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
again uh there's nothing wrong with the
 
00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:01.990 align:start position:0%
again uh there's nothing wrong with the
um

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
with the school district asking for
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
immunization records so they know who's
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinating who's not if they choose to
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
um but again i i don't necessarily think
 
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
we need to mandate this and i don't
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
think a mandate would change the
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
percentage of acts which children get
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or not
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair uh my questions
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
have been answered thank you

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
privacy my machine didn't want to unmute
 
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.110 align:start position:0%
privacy my machine didn't want to unmute
um

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
i'm a school board member and we just
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
recently worked on our policies
 
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.270 align:start position:0%
recently worked on our policies
and

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.390 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
schools actually have
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
have a requirement for vex providing
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
information about vaccines this this
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
bill talks about discrimination i'm
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
just as we have today that they're
 
00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.110 align:start position:0%
just as we have today that they're
special

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
special
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
plans to separate students to make sure
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
they adhere to the social distancing
 
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.789 align:start position:0%
they adhere to the social distancing
guidelines

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
would that be considered discrimination
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i understand your question
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
um representative cannon but but if i if
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
i can answer it the way i think yeah and
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
uh got it
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
was i don't think it's any different
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
than a peanut allergy right so yet when
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
you have a child in a classroom with
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
peanut analogy there are certain
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
controls that are put on
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
and that's not discriminatory that's
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
that's that's related so
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
um i i guess
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
i i would i would align it with a peanut
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
allergy i guess your answer but
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
um i i'm still not quite clear on your
 
00:20:01.039 --> 00:20:02.630 align:start position:0%
um i i'm still not quite clear on your
question

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
follow up give it another go
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
let me do it this way um given that in
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
the case of the covid it's it's passed
 
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.950 align:start position:0%
the case of the covid it's it's passed
by

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.830 align:start position:0%
by
um

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
through the air through
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
water droplets whereas a pain analogy
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
someone who ingests something that's
 
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.669 align:start position:0%
someone who ingests something that's
analogy

00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
analogy
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
in our schools currently we're placing
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
students six feet apart and there's a
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
piece of plexiglas in between
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
the seating to protect other students in
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
the room
 
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.750 align:start position:0%
the room
so

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
if a student
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
is not vaccinated ultimately when
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
they're available
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
would it be discrimination
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
to have a section within the classroom
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
that is separated from the other
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
students who have been vaccinated or
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
have yet to be vaccinated because of a
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
scheduling issues
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
question and i guess i'd answer it in
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say no it's not again if
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
you're following science and the school
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
district is following science and you've
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
got your plexiglass and you got your
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
masks and you got your social distancing
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
then whether a child vaccinated or not
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a whole lot of uh to do
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
with it does it um if you're following
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
all the other protocols so while
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination is a component it's not the
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
only component we'll hear from tris
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
tilly later and as i hear on a regular
 
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:28.950 align:start position:0%
tilly later and as i hear on a regular
basis

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
that um none of these uh answers are a
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
silver bullet um i think we've read that
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
vaccines even even now they're talking
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
about either variants or they're talking
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
about the fact that you can still even
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
with the vaccine get covered a second
 
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.909 align:start position:0%
with the vaccine get covered a second
time

00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
and so again relative to the specific um
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
virus that's going around um i i don't i
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
again if you
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
trust julia talk about multi-layer
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
threat protection um and that again if
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
you're following all the multi-layers
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
and you miss one but you've got the
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
other five then you're still pretty safe
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
so i would say yeah
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
again i i would i would consider it if
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
you were starting to create the haves
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman but my answer has
 
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:18.549 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman but my answer has
been

00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
or my question has been answered thank
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
you representative cushman
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.430 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
representative

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me do we currently
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
implement in public schools any other
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
kind of separation
 
00:22:34.159 --> 00:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
kind of separation
between

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
children who have
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
some vaccine exemption and those who do
 
00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:41.909 align:start position:0%
some vaccine exemption and those who do
not

00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
for any other diseases that are that
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
vaccines are
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
required for
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
sure having served in the school board
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
for six years i can tell you that my
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
school we've never implemented anything
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
i have a question for the prime sponsor
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
i remember
 
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.390 align:start position:0%
i remember
when

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
schools mandated vaccines
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
they were basically five or six or so
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
specific back vaccines that
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
all schools had
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
and some of them have gone on and i
 
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.950 align:start position:0%
and some of them have gone on and i
understand

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
20 or 30 things some of which
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
people think some people think are
 
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.070 align:start position:0%
people think some people think are
dubious

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
dubious
 
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.669 align:start position:0%
dubious
um

00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
would you be comfortable with the school
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
mandating the traditional five or six
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh as long as they did not go beyond
 
00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.510 align:start position:0%
uh as long as they did not go beyond
those

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
i'll leave that to the medical experts
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
to have that discussion again i i don't
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
think we should be meant the state
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
should be mandating what i put my body
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
with or any child pokes their body but
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
the parents are the best arbiter of the
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
medical care of their children
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
you know in consultation with their
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
medical providers
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
and that the state's not the best
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
arbiter telling me what i have to do
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
my follow-up is
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that around the country
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
not just in new hampshire the whole
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
question of who educates our children is
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
now up for discussion again and
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
charter schools which are a kind of
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
public school but private schools are
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
have been operating during the pandemic
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
in a way different from many public
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
schools would it be acceptable to you to
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
let the public schools continue to
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
mandate while other schooling options
 
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.830 align:start position:0%
mandate while other schooling options
for

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
have become more or could become more
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
affordable would that be an acceptable
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
thing to you
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
again if the private school is acting as
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
a private industry as the right to do
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
and choose as it will uh and let it let
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
it manage its own student body the way
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
it chooses to um again this is about the
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
state mandating something that covers
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
1.35 million people in the state of new
 
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.230 align:start position:0%
1.35 million people in the state of new
hampshire

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
representative is there anyone else um
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
representative weber from this committee
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
who wishes to ask a question yes there
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
is mr chairman i have representative
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
nelson followed by representative conner
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
thank you representative nelson please
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman but just like to
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
know who is discriminated against is the
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
student that's coming in
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
or those that are in school
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
so somebody has a condition
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
that could compromise somebody is it
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
being discriminatory discriminated yeah
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean discriminate
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
against the student who's trying to come
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
in because they don't want to tell
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
or the student that's in school that
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to get what they could be
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
bringing in
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
representative nelson again my my
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
my issue was around the um
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
and discrimination
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
may be the wrong word that was put in
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
there it's not the word i used when when
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
i gave to olss but they stuffed in there
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
my intention was that you can't be
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
denied access to any state programs or
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
state um activities again this is about
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
the state you know if you go back to
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
some basic constitutional laws and you
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
learn that the idea behind the
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
constitution was to limit what the state
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
can do not limit what the individuals
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
can do and so if you believe that that
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
this is a constitutional issue and this
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
is about limiting
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
the state and not limiting limiting what
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
people can do so
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
my goal was not to have a person
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
discriminated from uh participating in
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
state programs and functions
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.070 align:start position:0%
 
you're

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay i i was going to withdraw my
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
questions that was quite similar to
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative nelson's but now i am
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
more confused than i was before
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
um because we just had a long discussion
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
about schools and whether they could
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
require vaccinations
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
and now you're saying just state but
 
00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
since schools many of them public
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
schools are run by governmental entities
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
as in the towns
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
in cities it seems like we need to
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
clarify that language quite a bit
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
because my concern rests as
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative nelson's that we are
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
discriminating against the child who
 
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
cannot be vaccinated from coming to
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
school and participating fully if they
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
are in danger of catching any number of
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
diseases besides covet measles and other
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
things it all has to do with public
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
health and herd immunity so
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
would you be also welcome then to an
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
amendment which would say
 
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
somehow that it's only state programs
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
that schools uh can discriminate would
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
that be a comfortable amendment for you
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
well i i've been uncomfortable making a
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
statement that schools can discriminate
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
in the context of what we're saying here
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
so again i guess i would i
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
i would say that if there's just cause
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
so again if we talked about the fact
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
that hospitals and people have
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
compromised immunity so if the school
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
was had an issue with student that had a
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
compromised immunity then it may be able
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
to do certain things that it wouldn't be
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
able to do otherwise
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
but again it has justification in that
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
in with the child but um
 
00:28:10.399 --> 00:28:11.350 align:start position:0%
in with the child but um
again

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
it's up to health and human services how
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
they want to amend this bill i my big
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that my big discussion point
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
was that my intention was not to push
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
this out to individual
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
um businesses in the community this is
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
about the state going back to that
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional argument the state cannot
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
mandate and and on its population that
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's a control on the state not a
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative lang
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
with this bill um
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
would this protect against
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
discrimination for accepting medical
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
interventions such as
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
using medical marijuana
 
00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.310 align:start position:0%
using medical marijuana
yes

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you any further members of the
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
committee wish to ask a question
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
yes i have a question from
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
representative nutter oppam and i'm
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
going to request
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative knurk to lower his
 
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
virtual hand if he's all set
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh so rep it's representative nutter up
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
him only and representative knicks okay
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
at this point representative
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.630 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm in favor of half of this bill
 
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.269 align:start position:0%
so i'm in favor of half of this bill
um

00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
and i've received you know
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
not quite hundreds of letters from
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
people who saying they shouldn't be
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
forced to take an injection
 
00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:37.830 align:start position:0%
forced to take an injection
um

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
and i believe i believe in that kind of
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
freedom however
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
the second half uh lines five through
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
six no person may be discriminated
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
against her refusal to accept an
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
unwanted medical intervention including
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
immunizations so you
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
kind of stated before you'd be open for
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
an amendment um
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
and so i of course would not want to go
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
into a hospital where none of the nurses
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
or doctors were immunized so if you want
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
to clear up that language and an
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.110 align:start position:0%
amendment to
um

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
take out
 
00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:15.590 align:start position:0%
take out
this

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
differentiate between the state part and
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
individual businesses
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
i might consider voting for it
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i i will happy
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
to look at that um again that wasn't my
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
intention to do that but i will say that
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
even right now you have no idea who's
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
who has vaccinations or not when you go
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
into a hospital right you have you have
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
no idea whether i i have i have oh may i
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
follow up with uh
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean because i worked in
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals and of course i was required
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
to at least get a tb test every year and
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
they of course offered i mean so
 
00:30:53.279 --> 00:30:53.990 align:start position:0%
they of course offered i mean so
i

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
yeah they didn't have my immunization
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
record but there were certain
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
diseases such like tb that they had
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
rules around so everyone who worked at
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
the hospital had to have the tb test
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
every year and the flu vaccine was
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
offered not forced but offered so
 
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.710 align:start position:0%
offered not forced but offered so
anyway

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated business and
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
you know there's typhoid mary's out
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
there we want to be careful absolutely
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative up up
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
another up i agree and again if the
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
individual business choose to and with
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
the tb test is is reasonable um
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
again i don't see people running away
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
from that but
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
again this is about what you're
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
injecting into your body um and and i'd
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
be con and not only that again any
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
medical intervention um and and worried
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
about discrimination or
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
lack of access again i i never want to
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
see a situation where the state can
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
mandate something and say you can't go
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
to dmv and get your license unless you
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
got a certain card that says you got
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
this done
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
just be bad again but we should not be
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
mandating on our individual citizens
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lang
 
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.509 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lang

representative
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
weber is there anyone else
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative woods has his hand up
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
oh thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative lang for taking my
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
question uh just uh uh uh following up
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh with uh representative uh nutter
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
upham's uh question relative to
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals uh the state run runs a
 
00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.789 align:start position:0%
hospitals uh the state run runs a
hospital

00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
at the the state hospital for
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
psychiatric care
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh this would preclude the state
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
from following um the mandates in other
 
00:32:39.519 --> 00:32:40.789 align:start position:0%
from following um the mandates in other
hospitals

00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:41.750 align:start position:0%
hospitals
of

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
prevent them from mandating
 
00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.509 align:start position:0%
prevent them from mandating
appropriate

00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
immunizations especially given the
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.350 align:start position:0%
well
again

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're going back to the covid
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
conversation and again i don't think any
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
nurse at any hospital is mandated to
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
have the covert vaccine it's offered as
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
we heard um
 
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.190 align:start position:0%
we heard um
another

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh talk about that again she worked in
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
the hospital they didn't mandate
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
vaccines they made them offered and
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
available to any nurse or any first
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
responder that wants it wants them and
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
even in the state of new hampshire we
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
current we don't mandate our first
 
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
responders get the copit vaccine we make
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
it available to them and many have
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
chosen i expect that this isn't going to
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
have a major change on um
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
the vaccination rates within the state
 
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire i just want it clear
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
that people have if they choose not to
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
get it that's okay and that's their
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
choice and that if the state can't
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
mandate and then definitely not down the
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
road mandate that you only participate
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
in certain state functions if you did
 
00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:47.590 align:start position:0%
in certain state functions if you did
that

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
bothers me that that's a possibility and
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
i don't want to see that
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%

the chair recognizes representative
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
yes yes oh thank you for taking my
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
question mr chairman um i'm going to
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
keep this very brief
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh medical freedom is the right to
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy i can't think of a more
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
fundamental a right than the right to
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
govern your own body
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
i also can't believe that this is
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
something that we need to codify because
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
to quote john locke
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
every man has a property in his own
 
00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:40.790 align:start position:0%
every man has a property in his own
person

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
this nobody has a right to but
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
himself yet it does seem to be necessary
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
to list this freedom when a government
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
forces a medical procedure of any type
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
they've largely eliminated informed
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
consent which is a violation of medical
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
ethics in conclusion i urge you all to
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass to begin the process
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
of enumerating this most essential and
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands up mr chairman
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much the
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
chair now recognizes beth daley from the
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
good morning uh representative pearson
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee sorry about
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
that it took a minute for them to unmute
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
me my name is beth daley and i'm the
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
chief of the bureau of infectious
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
disease control here at the new
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of health and human
 
00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:48.710 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of health and human
services

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to provide testimony in
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 220
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
immunization as you all know is
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
considered one of the most important
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
public health achievements of the last
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
century it's prevented millions of
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
illnesses disabilities and deaths here
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
in the united states but despite the
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
success we know that not everyone gets
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
vaccinated vaccination coverage is not
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
100 percent
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
nor are most vaccines 100 percent
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
effective so these outbreaks of vaccine
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
preventable diseases can still occur
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
when an unvaccinated person becomes
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
infected and introduces that disease
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
into a community especially one that has
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
low vaccination rates
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
it is therefore critical that certain
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
requirements for immunization remain in
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
place such as those that pertain to
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
employment and health care settings and
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
those for school in child care entry as
 
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.750 align:start position:0%
those for school in child care entry as
well

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
these requirements are in place for
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
immunization to prevent the spread of
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
communicable disease to protect our most
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
vulnerable residents
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
as one example that you've already
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
discussed some healthcare facilities
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
require employee vaccination to protect
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
the lives of their very vulnerable
 
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.750 align:start position:0%
the lives of their very vulnerable
patients

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
such as requiring influenza vaccine to
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
prevent outbreaks in long-term care
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
facilities where residents can die if
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
they become infected with with influenza
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
all hospitals in our state have policies
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
requiring influenza vaccination for
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
their staff
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
now some do allow for certain exemptions
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
such as for medical or religious reasons
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
while others only allow medical
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
exemptions these policies have increased
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates among our health care
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
workers from less than 60 percent
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
choosing to voluntarily get vaccinated
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
to going above 95 to about 95 i should
 
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:32.790 align:start position:0%
to going above 95 to about 95 i should
say

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
so if you do eliminate these policies
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates will without question
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
decrease substantially
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
an additional setting of concern that
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
you've also spoken to
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
our schools and child care facilities
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
under rsa 141c 20a
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
this provides the department with the
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
authority to require
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
certain vaccinations prior to school and
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
child care entry
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
all states in the united states have
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
these requirements and many states have
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
even tightened their laws following
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
large outbreaks of infectious diseases
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
that were driven by decreasing
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
vaccination vaccination rates this is a
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
major problem in 2019 as one example
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
there were over 1200 cases of measles in
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
31 states across the country that was
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
driven by low vaccination rates
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
now as you pointed out not all vaccines
 
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
recommended for children are required
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
for school and child care entry we
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
always balance public health protection
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
with individual choice and so we only
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
require those that are most essential
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
and likely to be transmitted in this
 
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.470 align:start position:0%
and likely to be transmitted in this
setting

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
setting
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
these requirements are developed with
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
public input through the administrative
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
rules process
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
despite our high childhood vaccination
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
rates here in new hampshire we continue
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
to have thousands of cases and outbreaks
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
of vaccine preventable diseases
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
just that's data from the last decade
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
so and lastly just to point out that
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
people do have a choice they do not have
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
to be vaccinated they only need to be
 
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinated if they want to participate
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
in certain activities where there is
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
impact to others who are vulnerable and
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
they need protection from infectious
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
diseases relaxing requirements for
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
immunization will lead to preventable
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
disability and death and result in
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
significant harm to our population and
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
as such the department strongly opposes
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 220 and i'm i thank you for
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify and i'm happy
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
to address any questions you might have
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
00:40:27.359 --> 00:40:29.910 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
cushman

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman um is it dr
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
beth daly sorry
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
yes i'm a doctor of public health okay
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you can i ask is there proof that
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
outbreaks of
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
these communicable diseases are due to
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated children
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
in schools and because consider many
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
people who get the measles for example
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
from these outbreaks i know we're
 
00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.349 align:start position:0%
from these outbreaks i know we're
vaccinated

00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question may i
 
00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.910 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question may i
respond

00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
respond
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
chairman yes
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
so in the outbreak that i referenced in
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
2019 90 of those individuals who
 
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
were in part of that outbreak were
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated so no the data shows that
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
um that people who are unvaccinated are
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
primarily affected however because
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
these vaccines are not 100 effective
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
there are always people who even though
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
they have making made that good choice
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
of getting vaccinated are still impacted
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
um can you explain to me your reasoning
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
for believing that hb 220 would reduce
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
yes because it's our experience and we
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
have data that shows that when you
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
implement policies requiring vaccination
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
one more
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
so you're saying
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
that when we force people through
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
changes in law
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
where they have no choice but to get
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
vaccinated that that increases
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates
 
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.470 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates
yes

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else in the committee mr
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%

gay thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
dr daley for taking my question
 
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
um i'm curious as to
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
how y'all are handling moderna's
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
statement their top doctor is saying
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
that uh we cannot
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh we cannot say that it's effective at
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
preventing people
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
from uh getting sick
 
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.510 align:start position:0%
from uh getting sick
and

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
spreading it it's it's um yeah modern
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
abbas i'll just read the
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
headline modern abbas says covet shot
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
not proven to stop viral spread
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
what it's saying is that it's supposed
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
to make you not get sick
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
so that my concern is
 
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.430 align:start position:0%
so that my concern is
uh

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
that you know i'm also an adherent to uh
 
00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:30.470 align:start position:0%
that you know i'm also an adherent to uh
bodily

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
bodily
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
the right to one's own
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
medical uh decisions
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
and uh i personally was vaccinated and
 
00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.589 align:start position:0%
and uh i personally was vaccinated and
received

00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
shots like dpt as a kid but i got about
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
five before i started first grade now 75
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
are recommended and offered that's a big
 
00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.510 align:start position:0%
are recommended and offered that's a big
difference

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you so much if i may i answer was
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
that the end i'm sorry the format just
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
okay i will answer then um so
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
first of all um
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
actually so cdc recommends that children
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
get vaccinated against 16 diseases now
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
when you take into the number the number
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
of doses in this particular series to be
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
fully vaccinated that's where you come
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
up with those 75 doses but actually
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
because the way they manufacture
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines and they have you know improved
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
their technology over time you're
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
actually getting less antigen injected
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
into your body than in um you know prior
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
years right they've been proved the way
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
that these vaccines work over time and
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
then to your question about the moderna
 
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.390 align:start position:0%
then to your question about the moderna
vaccine

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
what the distinction is there is
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
actually that it's 95
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
effective at protecting you from
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
developing covid19 that is very highly
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
effective and we're very pleased by that
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to protect you as the person
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
who's received the vaccine what they're
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
still studying is whether that means
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
that you whether that means you can
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
potentially have the virus if you get
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
exposed go up into your nose and into
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
your mouth and um
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
the vaccine doesn't prevent that virus
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
from being in those spaces
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
it prevents you from getting sick but
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
that but is it possible for that virus
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
to be there and that you could spread it
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
to other people even though you're not
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
sick right because we know that this
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
virus is very interesting
 
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
disease that's made it very challenging
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
that you can develop asymptomatic
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
infection and transmit it to other
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
people so that's what they're trying to
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
study and it's a distinction it's
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely protective for you if you're
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinated they're still studying
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not it can be transmitted
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
though from you even though you're
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinated to other individuals so
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully that makes sense how i've
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
described that it's a little bit of a
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
complicated topic and one that they're
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.790 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
because that is exactly my point though
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
that we're we're discussing
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
it sounds like please correct me if i'm
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
interpreting this incorrectly
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we are concerned
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
about mandating it
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
mandating the covet shots
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to spread it
 
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.470 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to spread it
whereas

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
my point and question is
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
if we're not sure
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
that it's prevent spreading then what's
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
the harm of letting people
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
opt to not take it and just take their
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
chances which
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
sound pretty good with other medicines
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
like ivermectin
 
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
well i'm not sure that we're talking
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
about mandating covet 19 vaccine
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
currently the state's position is that
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
we have no intention of mandating
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
covenanting vaccines so if you're if
 
00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
you're interested in applying that to
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
other vaccines we do already know that
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
other the rest of the vaccines are very
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
effective at preventing transmission and
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
covid19 vaccine is also effective at
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
preventing transmission they're still
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
studying some features of that can they
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
say it's 100 effective
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
no but we know from science that
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
whenever you're symptomatic with a
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
disease you're going to spread that
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
disease more readily because the virus
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
particles are coming out of your nose
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
and mouth as you cough and sneeze so
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
even if people who are vaccinated have
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
the virus inside their nose and in mouth
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
they're much less likely to spread it
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
because they're not actively sick
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
coughing and sneezing those virus
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
particles around now is
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
they can they still transmit it perhaps
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
that's what's being studied you can't
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
say 100 that they won't but it's they
 
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
the majority of people will not and
 
00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.430 align:start position:0%
the majority of people will not and
that's

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
very makes it very effective
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else from the committee
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
who has not asked a question of dr daley
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.710 align:start position:0%
 
acton

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
acton
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative acting
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
dr daley for taking my question
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh my question is regarding the
 
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:00.870 align:start position:0%
uh my question is regarding the
uh

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
our natural immune systems um certainly
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
there's there's vitamins and and
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of techniques to improve our
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
natural immune systems my worry is that
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
the reliance on
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
so many vaccines
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
damaging our natural immune systems do
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
you do you have any um
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge of of the reliance on vaccines
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
where it may be reducing
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
our our natural
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
ability to fight off things like the flu
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
in in which case we're we're heading
 
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.829 align:start position:0%
in in which case we're we're heading
down

00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
not a positive road by being relaxed so
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
reliant on vaccines
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that question that's a
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
great question and one question we've
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
certainly been asked so remember that
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
your body is actually confronted with
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
millions of bacteria and viruses every
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
single day so your body has the
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to develop lots of natural
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
immunity to all kinds of different
 
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
bacteria that live
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
in our environment that we're exposed to
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis these are not the
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
ones that we vaccinate against for so no
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
you um there is no impact regarding that
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
these vaccines have prevented millions
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
of illnesses and deaths um since they've
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
been you know invented and
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you dr
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
daley for taking my question
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
is preventing people to attend school as
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
an example
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
or to travel on an airplane as an
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
example potential example
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm not quite sure i understand the
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
question we that is we do have mandatory
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirements for school and
 
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
child care entry
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
um we there's no requirements for
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
boarding an airplane nor do we have any
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
intention of developing those
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
follow up follow-up
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
so there's been talk about uh with the
 
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.150 align:start position:0%
so there's been talk about uh with the
covid

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
covid
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine in particular
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
having to have a vaccination
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
record with you when you board a
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
plane that to me sounds like mandating
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any conversations in
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire around that subject if
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
you're talking about nationally i can't
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
speak to the national policy that's
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
being discussed on uh travel
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
requirements or if those are being
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
implemented by you know
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
by private companies but again um people
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
still have a choice they're not being
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
required to receive
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
a vaccine if they don't want one there
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
just might be implications from that
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
decision so that they don't put other
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
people at risk for not choosing to be
 
00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.430 align:start position:0%
people at risk for not choosing to be
vaccinated

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinated

thank you again my name is patricia
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
tilley i'm the deputy director of the
 
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
division of public health services here
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
at the department of health and human
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
services i only want to underscore dr
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
daley's testimony and remind the
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
committee that we also share
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative lang's intention that
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
indeed individuals should generally have
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
choice and informed consent but dhhs
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
opposes this bill due to the broad
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
language that may have a negative impact
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
in particular the broad use of the word
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
discrimination raises questions as we've
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
heard about school and child care
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements private industry
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
health care settings it may also have
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
implications far beyond communicable
 
00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:03.510 align:start position:0%
implications far beyond communicable
disease

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
disease
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that the communicable
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
disease statutes in new hampshire
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
protect and support individuals to make
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
choices for example 141 c 20 c
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
provides opportunity for religious
 
00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.790 align:start position:0%
provides opportunity for religious
exemptions

00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
but our laws also protect individuals
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
from the decisions of others as noted
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements protect those who
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
are compromised
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
but since much of this conversation has
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
focused on vaccine i just want to close
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
with the notion that vaccine gives your
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
family freedom freedom for elderly
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
patients to go to the store without fear
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
freedom for your children to learn in
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
the way that works best for them and
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
freedom for your spouse to work without
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
the fear of bringing illness into the
 
00:52:47.359 --> 00:52:48.150 align:start position:0%
the fear of bringing illness into the
home

00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
for my time on the reopening task force
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
i've learned vaccines also make good
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
business sense a vaccinated workforce is
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
not only healthier and more productive
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
but allows employers to focus on their
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
business freeing employees from
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
quarantine and travel restrictions at
 
00:53:04.079 --> 00:53:05.109 align:start position:0%
quarantine and travel restrictions at
times

00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
the concern dhhs has with this
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
particular bill is the broad use of the
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
word discrimination we believe that this
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
may open us up to unintended
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
consequences so thank you
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
and i will defer my time thank you
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative pearson
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
we will now be taking questions from the
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
general public and we will go to the one
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
minute rule
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
this is a rule that has been established
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
not just this year but in the past
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
when there are multiple multiple people
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
wishing to testify
 
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
and it is the position of the house of
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
representatives that the citizens have a
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
right to be heard
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
it is also the case
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
that we have to do an awful lot of work
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
in an abbreviated amount of time
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
so therefore when i call on somebody
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
from the general public you will have
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
one minute to speak
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
at the end of the one minute you will be
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
muted and i will call the next person
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
this is as i said an ongoing policy and
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
it is for situations like this
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
the chair calls from the general public
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
i do not see her in the list
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
if you uh miss edwards if you do
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
if you are online could you please raise
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
i'm working off the list christina that
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
i was just given about a half an hour
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
ago i'm starting on page one at the
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
okay i do not see ms edwards thank you
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
hello this is eric power can you hear me
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
yes we can thank you go ahead yes this
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
is eric power i'm a 26-year resident of
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
brookline i've also served as a school
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
board member for the hollis brookline
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district for three
 
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.069 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district for three
years

00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
and um i am very concerned about
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
mandatory vaccines and i do not believe
 
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
that i i'm in support of this bill
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
because i believe that vaccines should
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
not be made mandatory
 
00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:41.589 align:start position:0%
not be made mandatory
for

00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
anyone in the state i think that
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
everybody's bodies is their own the
 
00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.390 align:start position:0%
everybody's bodies is their own the
children

00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
decisions for them need to be made by
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.150 align:start position:0%
the parents
and

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines you know there is risk there
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
there's been you know there's there's
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
there's some safety problems with some
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
vaccines and so with there is where
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
there is risk there needs to be a choice
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
and so i would recommend passage of this
 
00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:06.470 align:start position:0%
and so i would recommend passage of this
bill

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
recommend ought to pass
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
because i think it's very important for
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to maintain its live free
 
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
or die
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
motto and to maintain our personal
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%

my name is maria nardi i'm a resident of
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
hollis new hampshire um i did provide an
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
email testimony i'll just read it so
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
because i need to be brief um so just
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that you know i've
 
00:56:47.589 --> 00:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
never been against vaccinations uh we've
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
all had our vaccinations in this family
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
but i am completely against any
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
mandating of any vaccination especially
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
the one for covert 19 which i understand
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
is is not you know considered to be
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
mandatory but
 
00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:01.910 align:start position:0%
mandatory but
um

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
so vaccines you know they come with um
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
there's always a health benefit risk
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
there so you have to weigh the health um
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
benefits versus the risks and for you
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
know a vaccine like covid19 which you
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
know the data from the cdc by and large
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
you know clearly shows that is it is not
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
um a a dangerous virus for you know
 
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:24.870 align:start position:0%
um a a dangerous virus for you know
healthy

00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%

00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
people under the age of 60 60. i have
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
supporting evidence for this if you if
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
you need it um it's in um in the email
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
that i uh the email testimony that i put
 
00:57:34.079 --> 00:57:34.950 align:start position:0%
that i uh the email testimony that i put
forth

00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
um also uh this has been listener what's
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
up you should have been muted
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%

you can hear me thank you my family and
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
i just moved to this beautiful state we
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
came here from new york in september
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
because a half a year and a half ago new
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
york removed the religious exemption and
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
my son was kicked out of school along
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
with 26 000 other children
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
we moved to new hampshire seeking
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
freedom and the ability to make health
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
decisions for our family without the
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
state forcing us to submit to medical
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
procedures that we don't want
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
new new hampshire stands as a beacon of
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
freedom and we fled here because we
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
believe the live free or die state will
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
stand up to tyranny and defend and
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
respect everyone's right to make their
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
own medical decisions about their own
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
bodies regardless of their political
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
affiliation or personal beliefs as a
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
registered nurse i understand the
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
science and what i know to be true is
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
that science is ever evolving at one
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
point we were told by science that
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
cigarettes were beneficial that ddt
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
should be sprayed directly on the skin
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
of children that vioxx was safe
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%

00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
manufacturers themselves is still in the

practice experience
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
one of the most basic tenets of the
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
practice of medicine is that of informed
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
consent informed consent think about
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
what that simple phrase means we as
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
health care providers inform the sick
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
the injured the patient and they give
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
give us their consent to proceed or not

to
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
in the process of providing informed
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
consent we are obligated to present the
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
patient with the risks and benefits of
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
the treatment whether it be a medication
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
a surgical procedure or any intervention

to which they are being asked to consent
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
even immunizations
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
if after being presented with those
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
risks and benefits they decline the
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
treatment that is their inviolate right
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
as human beings government plays no role
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
in this decision
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
if you dare to vote no on this bill you
 
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
are by default voting yay to eventually
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
allowing a big brother police state one
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
where there is no individual freedom no
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
right to self-determination and one
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%

privacy rights of a person

public health benefits of such treatment
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%

i would like to echo what dr daley said
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
and what patricia tilly said and also
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
focus particularly on
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
the discrimination aspect of this bill
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
sorry i was just walking in my office
 
01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:32.839 align:start position:0%
and i'm out of breath
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
um when healthcare
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
community health centers are required to
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
follow cdc recommendations on
 
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
immunizations and have policies on those
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
if one of their employees chooses not to
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
vaccinate or to receive a vaccination
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
they might be required to wear
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
additional ppe
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
or stop their clinical work does this
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
mean that they would be discriminated
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
against by their employer and i think
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
that's an unanswered question in this
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
bill that would be important to address
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
i would echo their concerns on the
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
state's facility licensing requirements
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%

academy of pediatrics um and we strongly
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill um for a lot of the
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
same reasons dr daley had mentioned
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
previously i'm one of the individuals
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
that gets to give out a lot of these
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
vaccines and we do a great deal of
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
informed consent with families and
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
families who ultimately have the
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
decision with regards to what happens to
 
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
their kids
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%

01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
i want to offer that protection to

everybody consistently and i have a
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
large population of kids who can't get
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
immunized and the best way for us to
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
protect those kids who can't get
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
immunized for various health reasons is
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
to make sure that as a population we are
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
doing everything we can to keep
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
everybody as vaccinated as we can and we
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
know any laws that decrease or
 
01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.470 align:start position:0%
know any laws that decrease or
improve

01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
improve
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
or i should say expand the non-medical
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions decreases immunization rates
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%

220 for many of the reasons already
given

01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
given
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
i would like people to think about
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
medical freedom as freedom for children
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
who are unable to be vaccinated to be
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
protected from contagious diseases which
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
are spread by unvaccinated other
 
01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.150 align:start position:0%
are spread by unvaccinated other
children

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
of course nobody in the state wants to
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
be able to demand whatever medical
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
procedures they like
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
but there are some situations in the
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
preservation of the public health where
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
requiring vaccinations is essential and
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
passing house bill 220 will weaken our
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
current situation
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
which is to have a very robust vaccine

opposition of this bill
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
and partly because of what has been said
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to add additional
 
01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.110 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to add additional
commentary

necessities that have been shown to
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
prove to save lives i would like to
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
quote the world health organization
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
that says that quote in 2018 about 86
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
percent of the world's children receive
 
01:13:59.669 --> 01:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
vaccines that would protect them
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
against polio diphtheria tetanus
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
pertussis measles immunizations
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
currently prevent two to three million
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
deaths per year despite the success
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
however more than 1.5 million people
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
worldwide die from vaccine preventable
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%

hi thank you um with one minute i have
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
i'd like to share that i also move my
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
family from new york state as i
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
understand this bill um it is about not
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
whether vaccines are effective or um
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
useful for public health but about
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
whether the state has the right to
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
impose their will and you as a group of
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
legislators have a very difficult
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
position right now you don't have the
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
right to make a medical choice for me my
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
family or anyone else in the state of
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire you only have a right to
 
01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.790 align:start position:0%
new hampshire you only have a right to
inform

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
inform
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
public health
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
practices and decisions which take a
 
01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.189 align:start position:0%
practices and decisions which take a
variety

01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
variety
 
01:15:09.199 --> 01:15:10.550 align:start position:0%
variety
of

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
a variety of forms not just vaccination
 
01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.229 align:start position:0%
a variety of forms not just vaccination
so

01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
we could argue for days and days about
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
whether vaccines are wonderful and
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
effective but the point is is should you
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
as a legislator decide for other people
 
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
please do the right thing and don't try
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
to decide for other families
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
i can tell you from my own devastating
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
experience i had three top doctors in
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
new york state new york city behind my
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
family and it didn't make a damn bit of
 
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
difference and i lost everything
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
everything my home my mother my
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%

01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
yourself between doctors and children
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%

letting us know whether you're for or
 
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
against the bill and then you have one
 
01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.510 align:start position:0%
against the bill and then you have one
minute

01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
minute
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you can you hear me again
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
okay i strongly approve of this bill i'm
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot of big corporations and
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
organizations opposing this bill and and
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
while i appreciate everyone getting a
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
voice to their opinion there is no data
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
or science that you can present to me
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
that can convince me that anyone has my
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
loved ones best interests and mine more
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
than me
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
so i urge you to approve this bill this
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
is not about our choice of vaccinations
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
this is about our freedom it's about our
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
choice to make our own choices and
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
nothing else
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your time today and i
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%

01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh i don't see anyone else we do have
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
rebecca kischinevsky she's already
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
spoken actually we have john schmidt
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
who's just raised his hand
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.239 --> 01:17:24.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

no one's ever gonna vaccinate me i'll
 
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
fight to the death before anybody
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
the other thing i would ask you reps to
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
do for your own good and for you for the
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
sake of the people that you represent
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
do some research on the germ theory of
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
disease versus the terrain theory the
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
germ theory has never been proven all
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
these vaccines are based on the germ
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
theory it's bull crap from that
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
fraudster pasteur
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
and it was debunked by the chomps a long
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
time ago all these vaccines
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
there's no need for them thank you
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
unless you're planning on hearing a
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
second round there's no one else
 
01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
with that the chair closes the hearing
 
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
everyone who wanted to speak got a
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
chance to speak once
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
now i would make this suggestion um i
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
would i was hoping to exec the bill but
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
i would like to hold it briefly or a
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks and ask representative
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
yes he is thank you representative lang
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
i would suggest
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
that the various members of the
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
committee who had suggestions
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
communicate with you we are being told
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
that there's just
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
not a lot of time for subcommittee work
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
however if people who said that they had
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
suggestions maybe to make the bill
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
acceptable would communicate with you
 
01:19:02.159 --> 01:19:04.070 align:start position:0%
acceptable would communicate with you
directly

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
directly
 
01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
and then you could craft an amendment
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
and get somebody on this committee to
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh sponsor it for you uh we could
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
present that when it's time to exact
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
would that be acceptable to you
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%

legwork and get the uh amendment written

thank you mr vice chairman and thank you
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
committee members for taking my
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
testimony today i introduced house bill
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
221 an act making the state vaccine
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
registry and opt-in program
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
as many of you know the state vaccine
 
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
program was voted in the database was
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
both within
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
a few years ago
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
and in the initial
 
01:20:58.630 --> 01:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
legislation it was made as an opt-out
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
program however all of the information
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
i've gathered is the opt out program is
 
01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:05.110 align:start position:0%
i've gathered is the opt out program is
is

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
fairly non-working um and that people
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
aren't informed they have the right to
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
opt out
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
or if they are informed it's small print
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
on the back of a form that they sign
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
when they go get their vaccines and it's
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
not a verbal opt-in or opt-out um so
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
people are unaware the fact that they
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
can uh choose to opt out of this
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
database and state control state um
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
database so what this bill does and
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
i bought the bill into alignment if you
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
if for those who were in the house again
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'm representing tim lang from belknap
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
four um
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
i'm in my third term and back in 2017 we
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
had a constitutional amendment
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
about the right of new hampshire
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
citizens to
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
be safe in their information from the
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
state and collection of information from
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
the state this was a constitutional
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that passed the house with
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
greater than required amount it was
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
two-thirds and went to the people of new
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire for a vote in 2018
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
and the citizens of new hampshire and i
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
think it was 85 percent of the citizens
 
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire agreed that um the
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
state should be um
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
that the right of the citizen to be
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
protected in their public their data
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
from the state is is important enough
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
that they put it in the constitution
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
that is now article 2b um and so this
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
bill is to align our current statute
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
with article 2b so instead of this
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
opt-out provision that is not clearly
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
informed to the
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
people getting a vaccine we've chosen to
 
01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
invert this and make it an opt-in so
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
again the
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
the health care provider just like an
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
informed consent would have to ask the
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh the person getting the vaccination
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
whether they can uh have their data
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
stored in the state database again i
 
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
think this brings the
 
01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
the program into an alignment with what
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
the citizens in new hampshire want as
 
01:23:03.189 --> 01:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
evidenced by that 85 percent vote on
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
protecting the privacy of their data
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i recognize
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much for taking my
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
question representative lang
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
you write you made a comment about that
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
patients were not getting the
 
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity presented to them to opt in
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
and i have a question since the registry
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
is very important for the communication
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
back and forth between
 
01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
let's say a pharmacy and a provider or
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
to the dhhs to help look at where we
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
need better vaccine coverage
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
would you be amenable to a an amendment
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
which would
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
require a sorry which would
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
require a
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
information sheet be given to a patient
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
for them to read to understand what the
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
rationale is for this program
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
and require their signature
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
for them to
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
be able to uh decline opting in in other
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
words it would not be an automatic
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
automatic opt-in but they would have to
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
decline that and acknowledge that they
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
are aware again informed consent of the
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
impact upon their health care that may
 
01:24:16.629 --> 01:24:16.639 align:start position:0%
come from them not opting in would you
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
be comfortable with that
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
i understand your question is your
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
question is as long as there was some
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
sort of written informed consent that
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
was explicit um for the opt-out that
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
they were informed they could opt out
 
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
again i i guess i don't see
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm putting this in alignment with
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
the constitution i guess if that's the
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
only way you guys will pass the bill
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
i'll take that better than nothing but
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
um but again you know as you read um our
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
the constitutional amendment to 2b that
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
says an individual's right to live free
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
from governmental intrusion and private
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
or personal information is natural
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's what was passed and that's what
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
the citizens of new hampshire wanted so
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
i think that it's more appropriate to
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
ask can we keep your data rather than
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
ask is okay
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
uh do you want to opt out of having the
 
01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
data i think it's um it's more
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate to ask permission to get the
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
data first
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative kenner you're recognized
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
i yes i appreciate that but is it not
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
important as part of informed consent
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
for the individual to understand the
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
implications of them not opting in in
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
other words uh
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
informed consent requires a two-way
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
street it requires education as to what
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
the implications are if you do or do not
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
do a procedure or in this case signing
 
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.830 align:start position:0%
do a procedure or in this case signing
in

01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you again representative for your
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
question again
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
my answer is i if the choice is do you
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
want to opt in and if you don't opt in
 
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
then this is the potential then i'm fine
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
with that um i'm not i don't want the
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
inverse i don't want to
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
force them to opt out and oh by the way
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
if you opt out this is what happens i
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
want the citizen to make an informed
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
decision and say yes i want my data in
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
for representative lang
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative blang is the underlying
 
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
concern here is that data is going into
 
01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
a state database and the data would be
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
shared outside of the reason for being
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
in the database and we have many
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
databases within the
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
state itself and i think a
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment was to try to
 
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
prevent the state from releasing the
 
01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.390 align:start position:0%
prevent the state from releasing the
data

01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
without the patient's approval is that
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
kind of the intent behind the bill
 
01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
again the constitutional amendment
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't talk about sharing data at all
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
the constitutional amendment just says
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
that again as i go back to it it's an
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
individual's right to live free from
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion into private or
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
personal information
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
and so i i think that's a very broad uh
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
statement and it says that anytime the
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
government's going to collect data on me
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
i should know that it's collecting the
 
01:27:02.159 --> 01:27:16.229 align:start position:0%
i should know that it's collecting the
data

01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
mr chair if i may follow up uh yes you
 
01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:24.070 align:start position:0%
mr chair if i may follow up uh yes you
may

01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
you may follow up representative
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
merchant okay thank you
 
01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:28.870 align:start position:0%
merchant okay thank you
so

01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
it belongs the patient is aware of the
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
fact that there is a way for them to
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
prevent the data being released
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
would that not suffice as well
 
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
so again
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
so again the the the constitutional um
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
to be doesn't talk about the sharing of
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
data it's about the collection of data
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
um and so my my statement would be that
 
01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.350 align:start position:0%
um and so my my statement would be that
again

01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
if the person opts in
 
01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:02.470 align:start position:0%
if the person opts in
then

01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
then they've given consent to the state
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
to use the data as it chooses but if the
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
person never has a choice to opt in um
 
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
and it's an automatic uh you have to opt
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
out and somehow you're supposed to
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
magically know that you're supposed to
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
opt out um
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
then i i think that's inappropriate and
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's in violation of our
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
the constitutional amendment the will of
 
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
the people 85 percent of the people do
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
not want the government to collect their
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
private data and we're talking about the
 
01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:29.510 align:start position:0%
private data and we're talking about the
most

01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know one of the most sensitive data
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about medical data um and
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
so even more so we should be even more
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
stringent and so if the state's going to
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
collect this data i think we need to
 
01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:40.629 align:start position:0%
collect this data i think we need to
have

01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh sign off by each individual citizen
 
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
that chooses to
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
to have to allow the state to do that
 
01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
01:28:52.239 --> 01:28:54.830 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
lang

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative marsh i will do what you
 
01:28:59.910 --> 01:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
did for me and that is if someone in the
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
room has a question
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh i will text you and i just texted you
 
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative gay has her hand up
 
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
i i recognize representative gay
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative lange um um how would you
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
feel about the handout sheet
 
01:29:21.679 --> 01:29:22.470 align:start position:0%
feel about the handout sheet
that

01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
snerk is talking about is recommending
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
but use that sheet as an opt-in
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
i also don't like the idea of having to
 
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
opt out papers can get lost people can
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
miss knowing that they have dropped out
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
and i don't want my data collected by
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state so
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
but i think the informative
 
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
sheet sounds really useful so how would
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
you feel about using the same sheet that
 
01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.669 align:start position:0%
you feel about using the same sheet that
representative

01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
is talking about but choose it to opt in
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative gay and mark
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
thank welcome to see you again ma'am um
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
so again if you read the language of the
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
bill on a second sentences no patience
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
immunization or vaccine information
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
shall be entered into the registry
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
without explicit written opt-in consent
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
of the patient or the patient's parent
 
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
or guardian so again i i think an
 
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
informative sheet that that the person
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
can see the patient can see
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
choose whether you know they can write
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
on there what is the reason why the
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
state has this database and then the
 
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
person can choose to opt in
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
to opt-in if they choose to
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
um i think that's appropriate that's
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
exactly what's written in my bill thank
 
01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:38.149 align:start position:0%
exactly what's written in my bill thank
you

01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for the
 
01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:44.629 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for the
representative

01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will ask representative
 
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
pearson if he wants to take the chair
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
back or if he wants me to continue with
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
this hearing i'd love you to continue
 
01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:53.630 align:start position:0%

01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
infectious disease control here at dhhs
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
i'm here to provide testimony
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
in opposition to house bill 221
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
the immunization registry which we also
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
refer to as an iis immunization
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
information system is an electronic
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
system that tracks administration of
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines they offer many benefits to our
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
public health agencies as well as health
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
care providers and individuals
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
they prevent duplicate immunizations
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
they increase our immunization rates by
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
promoting up-to-date
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
immunization recommendations and helping
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
to remind patients when immunizations
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
are due it also benefits patients and
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
families when they want to access a
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
complete electronic copy of their
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
immunization record
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
that would include information from all
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
of their healthcare organizations
 
01:31:53.669 --> 01:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of where the vaccine was
 
01:31:53.679 --> 01:31:54.870 align:start position:0%
regardless of where the vaccine was
provided

01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
provided
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
and then finally we use that information
 
01:31:59.669 --> 01:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
to assure accountability of our publicly
 
01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
purchased vaccines as well as to target
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
communities with low vaccination rights
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
to prevent and respond to infectious
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
disease outbreaks
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is the last state in the
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
country to implement a registry and
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
every other state has one in place
 
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
under rsa
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
141c20f this
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
statute directs the department to
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
establish and maintain a state
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
immunization registry
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
this statute expressly states that
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
patient participation in the registry is
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
voluntary and the corresponding
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
administrative rule outlines a process
 
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
for patients to opt out of participation
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
which already includes asking people if
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
they want their information in the
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
registry and
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
in fact the rules explicitly say that
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to opt out of the
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
registry shall be provided in writing in
 
01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
a clear and succinct conspicuous manner
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
in simple language
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
and it to that patient
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
or the patient's parent or guardian if
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
the patient is a minor
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
we have not provided information to the
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
public yet on the opt-out process so
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's true people have not heard about
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
this yet and that's because we're not
 
01:33:05.679 --> 01:33:07.030 align:start position:0%
this yet and that's because we're not
collecting

01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
any non-coveted vaccine data yet we're
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
just standing up our registry now and
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
when we are ready to begin collecting
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
that vaccination data information on the
 
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
opting out process will be very broadly
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
shared and available quite easily on our
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
website this bill seeks to change our
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
registry to one that is opt in which we
 
01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:27.830 align:start position:0%
registry to one that is opt in which we
oppose

01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons first and
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
foremost our current opt-out approach
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
approach already protects an
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
individual's ability to choose not to
 
01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:37.030 align:start position:0%
individual's ability to choose not to
participate

01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
participate
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
while not adding costly burden to
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
providers and patients
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
nationwide almost all of the states have
 
01:33:46.629 --> 01:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
opt out policies rather than
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
opt in
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
and there are just three states that
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
have opt-in policies in large part
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
because of the lower cost lower burden
 
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
and increased public health benefits
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
of the opt
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
out model so texas i want to tell you
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
about really quickly it's one of those
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
three states that have an opt-in policy
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's been in place for many years
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
they're actually now working to
 
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
implement a change to become opt-out
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
after they conducted an evaluation of
 
01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
the cost associated with their opt-in
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
model and they found that it cost them
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
1.4 million dollars annually to obtain
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
consent for texas's opt-in model
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
another point i want to make is that
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
nationally the proportion of patients
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
who opt out of iis
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
participation is just five to ten
 
01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:34.070 align:start position:0%
participation is just five to ten
percent

01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
so requiring that providers
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
ask in writing and with a signed
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
document that every patient opt into the
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
registry when 90 to 95 of the population
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
do not opt out this creates substantial
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
unnecessary burden and costs for our
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
health care providers
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
so keeping our registry opt out will
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
reduce administrative burden and free up
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
the time of our health care providers to
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
engage in appropriate patient care
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
activities and allow health care
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
providers to efficiently document their
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
patient records for immunization
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
if we allow an opt-in registry it will
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
result in incomplete and low quality
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
information that will significantly
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
decrease the utility of this system and
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
national public health experts recommend
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
these opt out consent policies because
 
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
they do respect an individual's right to
 
01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:21.510 align:start position:0%
they do respect an individual's right to
privacy

01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
while also maximizing the availability
 
01:35:26.229 --> 01:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
of the data that we need
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire these individuals who
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
do not want to participate already have
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
a process in place to opt out and as
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
such the department strongly opposes
 
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 221 and again thanks for the
 
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify and i'm happy to
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you dr daley uh do we have
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
questions for dr daley representative
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
shapiro i recognize you
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:52.629 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
when the representative
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
um initially introduced the bill
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
instructions about opting out were in
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
small print or not readily available but
 
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
it sounds like
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
that hasn't gone actually gone into
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
use yet
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
as well as having instructions
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
about opting out on a website
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
what would you think about
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
either in written form or oral form a
 
01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
discussion about opting out occurring
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
as the immunizations are given in the
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for that uh
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
that that question and suggestion so
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
that process is already outlined in our
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
administrative roles the provider as
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
they're providing that immunization to
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
the patient does need to provide them an
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity already to opt out of the
 
01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:54.390 align:start position:0%
opportunity already to opt out of the
registry

01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
registry
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
so that is accounted for there
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
the providers are the ones who
 
01:37:00.629 --> 01:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
ultimately have the responsibility for
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
carrying out this process of of opting
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
out their patients and the ones that
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
have to provide information about the
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
registry and so i'm not aware that any
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
providers in our state are providing
 
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
this information yet to patients uh
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
because we have not requested any
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
immunization data from them other than
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
we are currently using the registry for
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine
 
01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:23.750 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine
tracking

01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
tracking
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
the chair represent recognizes
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
oh thank you very much mr chair mr vice
 
01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:36.159 align:start position:0%
chairman and um thank you dr daly for
 
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
um i'm just about to look up the
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
population of houston
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
because that's just one small part of
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
texas i'm from texas and you could put
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in there multiple times
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
just in the city so i'm expecting that
 
01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:53.229 align:start position:0%
just in the city so i'm expecting that
the

01:37:53.229 --> 01:37:53.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
1.4 million
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
to opt in in texas would be negligible
 
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
in texas in new hampshire and as a
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
proponent of keeping my
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
medical records
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
separate from any state registry
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
i think that's pretty pretty low price
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
yes does she respect the right to
 
01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.950 align:start position:0%
yes does she respect the right to
privacy

01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
i certainly do and there's a process for
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
you to opt out of the registry
 
01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
i i thank you are there further
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
leah cushman has a question
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:40.070 align:start position:0%
uh representative cushman you may ask

about to recognize you so i do not
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
recognize you for a question
 
01:38:53.590 --> 01:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for dr
 
01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:58.310 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for dr
daley

01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
in that case the chair calls on
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%

i have sent you an email with a policy
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
memo on this bill i strongly support
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
um i've supported it before it was even
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
a written bill i
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
lived in massachusetts for a while when
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
they implemented their immunization
 
01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.070 align:start position:0%
they implemented their immunization
registry

01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
registry
 
01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
and found the problems with their their
 
01:39:26.239 --> 01:39:27.270 align:start position:0%
and found the problems with their their
system

01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:28.629 align:start position:0%
system
um

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
they also have an opt-out system
 
01:39:31.679 --> 01:39:33.030 align:start position:0%
they also have an opt-out system
and

01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
in their law for the immunization
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
registry it's actually required that
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
they inform you that your information
 
01:39:40.629 --> 01:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
will be going into it and that you may
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
opt out
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
however in practice this is not taking
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
place and i was going to ask
 
01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.109 align:start position:0%
place and i was going to ask
um

01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
dr daley if she had ever researched the
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
the real reality of whether
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
patients were informed by providers
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
that they have the right to opt out we
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
have seen problems with opt-out forms in
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
public schools when it comes to
 
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
medical and dental clinics
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
where parents receive a form and it says
 
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
if you don't want your child to
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
participate then fill out this form and
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
then the forms are lost
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
um and they end up getting treatments
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:18.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
sorry this is my testimony
 
01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:23.990 align:start position:0%
sorry this is my testimony
um

01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.189 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
my um
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
as a nurse i i really i am a strong
 
01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
proponent of informed consent
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
um self-determination is a basic human
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
right um you know this
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
this this is our our medical information
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
and under hipaa we have to
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
we have to give consent to everyone else
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
for them to have our
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
private health information government
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
should be no different it should be an
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
explicit outright consent and not a
 
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
easily obscured
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
and missed through human error opt out
 
01:40:58.239 --> 01:40:59.830 align:start position:0%
and missed through human error opt out
process

01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%

i don't want to repeat
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
anything that dr daley said because i
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
think she said it a lot better than i
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
ever could
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
but i did want to reiterate that you
 
01:42:20.709 --> 01:42:20.719 align:start position:0%
know she um
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
talked about things such as
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
children that are potentially over
 
01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:26.629 align:start position:0%
children that are potentially over
immunized

01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
immunized
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
or under immunized
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
when their parents want them immunized
 
01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:32.310 align:start position:0%
when their parents want them immunized
um

01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
you know when we're monitoring community
 
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
immunization rates to know you know what
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
the spread of a disease may be
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
identifying coverage gaps
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature
 
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.109 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature
and

01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
we know from
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
history i mean even looking at the
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
the provider medical provider
 
01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:55.189 align:start position:0%
the provider medical provider
surveys

01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
surveys
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
when those were an opt-in
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
survey to participate in
 
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%
the response was
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
so low
 
01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:06.610 align:start position:0%
that the data collected
 
01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:08.149 align:start position:0%
that the data collected
[Music]

01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't even usable they didn't know
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
where anybody was they didn't know where
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
they were practicing they didn't know if
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
they're in retirement didn't even know
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
if they still resided in the state
 
01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:17.910 align:start position:0%
if they still resided in the state
um

01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:19.109 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
we know from our own experience in this
 
01:43:25.109 --> 01:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
state that when we make things opt-in
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
people rarely will
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
do what needs to be done
 
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
in order to overcome that barrier to
 
01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:35.990 align:start position:0%
in order to overcome that barrier to
opt-in

01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
opt-in
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
whereas we know that when we make them
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
opt out
 
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
people that don't want their information
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
in there
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely make sure that they
 
01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
uh make it known that they want um an
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
opt out
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
and so i think you know when we've got a
 
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
lot of individuals that might move from
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
one primary care office to another
 
01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:00.390 align:start position:0%
one primary care office to another
um

01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
and if they have small children
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
they may not know what immunizations
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
their children have had
 
01:44:09.189 --> 01:44:09.199 align:start position:0%
so they go to the new doctor's office
 
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
and that doctor's office has no way of
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
knowing without
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
having releases signed and obtaining a
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
full medical record what that child has
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
or hasn't had and um i think it goes
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
without saying that representative
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
merchant could
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
easily speak to the fact that
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
the pharmacies uh seem to send
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
information to the doctor's offices that
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
never gets
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
recorded in the
 
01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
electronic medical records so
 
01:44:38.470 --> 01:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
any vaccines that may have been
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
obtained in a pharmacy which i know
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
children's vaccines right now you can't
 
01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
get in pharmacies but we don't know what
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
the future is going to bring
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
um we do know that the pharmacies are
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
looking at tr um trying to expand into
 
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
at least influenza pd vaccines
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
and you know just in an effort not to
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
end up over immunizing children this is
 
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
extremely important
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
or as i said under immunizing them if
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
they've if they have a vaccine that they
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
need to receive three doses of in a
 
01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
certain amount of time this is a very
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
good tracking system
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
families that have
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
a lot going on it's very difficult to
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
track these these kinds of things um
 
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
and it would make it much easier if this
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
information was right at the fingertips
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
of any doctor that they brought their
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
child to see
 
01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:33.910 align:start position:0%
child to see
um

01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know i know that
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative knurk mentioned having a
 
01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
form that says you know when the doctor
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
or the pharmacist
 
01:45:43.590 --> 01:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
is going to give a vaccine somebody has
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
to check a box and sign it you already
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
have to do an informed consent
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
when you receive the vaccine
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
that there's no reason why you can't say
 
01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
that that has to be you know information
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
about the registry has to be in a
 
01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:57.669 align:start position:0%
about the registry has to be in a
certain

01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
certain
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
font uh size bolded
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know whatever maybe they need to
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
initial by it that they've read it you
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
know you can make that informed consent
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
crystal clear that you know that
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
somebody understood that it was an opt
 
01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:12.470 align:start position:0%
somebody understood that it was an opt
out

01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
registry and if they wanted to opt out
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
they would check a box
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
um so with that i think i've taken up
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
enough of your time i know you've got a
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
very busy morning
 
01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:22.790 align:start position:0%
very busy morning
um

01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:26.229 --> 01:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
but for all of those reasons new futures
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
does oppose this bill and we urge the
 
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
committee to vote in expedient to
 
01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:31.830 align:start position:0%
committee to vote in expedient to
legislate

01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
or look at
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
doing an amendment
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
such as the one that representative
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
knurk had mentioned
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions i'm available
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
to take them now or in the future thank
 
01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.590 align:start position:0%
to take them now or in the future thank
you

01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you ms stevens are there any
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
questions for mrs stevens yes
 
01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative gay
 
01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:54.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
miss stevens for taking my question um
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
if i'm going to opt out
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh does that mean at every single
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
provider i go to
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
i have to tell them not to submit my
 
01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:13.109 align:start position:0%
i have to tell them not to submit my
information

01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding at least when my
 
01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
or at least i say it's been my
 
01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:19.270 align:start position:0%
or at least i say it's been my
experience

01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
that every single time i go to my
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
doctor's office if they're gonna give me
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
a vaccination i have to sign a new
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
informed consent for that vaccination
 
01:47:30.149 --> 01:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
because they're administering something
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
i i think that that
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
can easily be added to that informed
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
consent form so you don't have to tell
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
them anything you just keep checking the
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
box it's it's just a little box that you
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
would check right when you sign the form
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
you have to sign the form anyway so
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:47:52.629 --> 01:47:52.639 align:start position:0%
as as though
 
01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
the doctor can forget to put it in front
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
of you because they can't give you the
 
01:47:56.159 --> 01:47:57.510 align:start position:0%
of you because they can't give you the
immunization

01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
immunization
 
01:47:57.520 --> 01:47:58.790 align:start position:0%
immunization
without

01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none the chair recognizes
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
patricia tilly from department of health
 
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
services i don't believe tricia tilly
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
was able to stay on this is beth daley
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
and so you can proceed
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much uh
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me now
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
yes we can

okay thank you
 
01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
um my name is laura condon i'm from
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
bedford i support this bill and i urge
 
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
you to support it too
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
this um chapter 141 c20
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
f um has been on her book since 1998 and
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
has never been changed this bill
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
actually doesn't change the law it
 
01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
simply reaffirms the intent of the
 
01:49:02.709 --> 01:49:02.719 align:start position:0%
current law that the state vaccination
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
registry shall be voluntary and
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
clarifies the process for ensuring
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
voluntary participation in fact
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
provisions of that chapter indicate that
 
01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's voluntary and i i direct you to
 
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
paragraphs two three
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
six e and in fact i'll read succeed
 
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
procedures for the registrant or the
 
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
registrant's parent or guardian if
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
they're registered as a minor to
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
withdraw consent for participation at
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
any time and to remove information from
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
the registry consent can only be
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
withdrawn if it was given in the first
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
place indicating this is an opt-in
 
01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:37.750 align:start position:0%
place indicating this is an opt-in
registry

01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
registry
 
01:49:40.390 --> 01:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
this bill affirms that
 
01:49:42.310 --> 01:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
participation will be voluntarily
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
actively given and not presumed let me
 
01:49:46.629 --> 01:49:46.639 align:start position:0%
remind you that this program is a
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
redundant program
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
doctors pharmacists schools and you
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
already have vaccination records the law
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
requires that all of these individuals
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
have vaccination records this is an
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
addition to those records
 
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
in addition parents have no access to
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
this registry this they can you can not
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
access it only medical providers can so
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
to represent the parents could use this
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
as a tool to look up their children's
 
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinations is not true
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
although this law has been on the books
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
for a long time there is no active
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination registry even though over
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
4.6 million dollars has been allotted to
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
this program since 2014
 
01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
there have been two bills that have
 
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
attempted to change this registry into a
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
mandatory opt-in registry i mean excuse
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
the opt-out registry that is not the new
 
01:50:40.629 --> 01:50:40.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire way and both bills failed
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
if one is swept into this registry
 
01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
without consent
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
getting out of it is not as easy as one
 
01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
might think you require the signed
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
signature of a vaccinating physician in
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
order to be removed from the program you
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
cannot unilaterally remove yourself from
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
this registry there's a surprise in this
 
01:50:59.430 --> 01:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
registry too
 
01:51:02.229 --> 01:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
by rule vaccination events are recorded
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
in the registry now i understand one
 
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
might think that vaccination event would
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
mean being vaccinated
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
but in fact the rules defying
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination event to include even
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
refusal of vaccination so even those who
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
refuse a vaccine and think they might
 
01:51:19.590 --> 01:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
not be swept into this registry will
 
01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
also have to complete an opt-out form
 
01:51:23.189 --> 01:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
because even those who decline
 
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinations become a part of this
 
01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:26.950 align:start position:0%
vaccinations become a part of this
registry

01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
registry
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
obviously there are con security
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
concerns with
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
any sort of database and you know we all
 
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
see hackers you know hacking into
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals banks um government entities
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
and so the the security um protection
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
there is important we must ensure that
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
this registry remains active
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
and that this um
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
is an opt-in program with your
 
01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
affirmative signature i know some people
 
01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
have said well there could be a little
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
check box this is currently not being
 
01:51:58.229 --> 01:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
used i have and i'll send it by email a
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
hannaford pharmacy vaccine informed
 
01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
consent form they've used for years in a
 
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
teeny teeny teeny tiny print buried in
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
the middle of the paragraph in the
 
01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
middle of the page there was language i
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
authorized the information to be
 
01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
forwarded to my primary care physician
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
authorizing physician or local

letters registry
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
so no one's ever gonna see that there's
 
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
not a check box to consent for that or
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
not i urge you to please pass this bill
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
into reaffirm and confirm that this is a
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%

state government relations with the new
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital association
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
representing all our hospitals in the
 
01:53:14.159 --> 01:53:15.109 align:start position:0%
representing all our hospitals in the
state

01:53:15.109 --> 01:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
the hospital association is opposed to
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 221 i have submitted written
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
testimony which i will not read for you
 
01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
but i do want on the record to state
 
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
that um and i think dr daley did a
 
01:53:30.149 --> 01:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
really good job so a lot of my testimony
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
kind of reiterates what she had
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
indicated but we do
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
have very big concerns about the opt-in
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
process which would be very cumbersome
 
01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
for both the individual and the health
 
01:53:42.070 --> 01:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
care provider creating barriers to
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
producing a comprehensive immunization
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
record for individuals and impede
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
sound clinical decision making if the
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
health care provider cannot rely on
 
01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
complete information for their patients
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
i did provide you with a number of
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
resources in my testimony
 
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
that i would actually i would encourage
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
you to review i think it's um it's
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
interesting information from the cdc and
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
other national um
 
01:54:09.589 --> 01:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
resources um and
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
i just would like um to have you look at
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
that later
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
the hospital association wants new
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire to develop a stable reliable
 
01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
and comprehensive vaccine registry that
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
can be used by and for health care
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
providers and individuals
 
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
our hospitals and health care providers
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
have been advocating for years to have a
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
functioning vaccine registry in our
 
01:54:31.599 --> 01:54:32.470 align:start position:0%
functioning vaccine registry in our
state

01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
as a reliable tool in their toolbox and
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
we ask that no changes be made to the
 
01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
registry structure before it even truly
 
01:54:41.109 --> 01:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
gets off the ground
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
and for these reasons we the hospital
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
association does not support house bill
 
01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
221 and we ask that you find this bill
 
01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:49.679 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate i'm thank you
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%

seeing none at the suggestion of
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative pearson i'm now calling

further testimony will be limited to one
 
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
minute as we are way behind schedule
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
the chair calls on representative jess
 
01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:15.589 align:start position:0%
the chair calls on representative jess
edwards

01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
yeah hi i'm representative jess edwards
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh representing
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
rockingham district four
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
the last four or five years of my career
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
i was a privacy and security officer for
 
01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
medical device manufacturers
 
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
one of the times that i was uh the the
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
bad guy in in the corporation was when
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
marketing people would come to me and
 
01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:39.750 align:start position:0%
marketing people would come to me and
say

01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
hey we need to get away from this
 
01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
corporate policy of uh opt-in
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
because if we make it opt out it tricks
 
01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
more people to give us data that they
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to give us otherwise and
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
if we have their data then we can do
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
more things for them we can make better

01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh a representative of the of the obama
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
administration got up and and advocated
 
01:56:16.709 --> 01:56:16.719 align:start position:0%
strongly for the privacy community to
 
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
switch to opt out instead of opt in
 
01:56:23.189 --> 01:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
because the rate of getting data was
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
vastly higher but it completely ignores
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
the concept that your data is yours
 
01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
it should require an active
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
permission by you to share your data
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%

i just want to highlight a couple of key
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
points from dr ladd's testimony kova 19
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
has served as a reminder of the value of
 
01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:23.679 align:start position:0%
immunizations vaccine registries are a
 
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
tool to increase and sustain sufficient
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine rates
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
a systematic universal registry allows
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
citizens to seek and obtain
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
immunizations in a safe and convenient
 
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
way while keeping providers informed
 
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock believes that house
 
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
bill 221 would be a step backwards this
 
01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
would hinder new hampshire's work to
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
improve the health and the safety of our
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%

of 2020 my organization submitted right

to no request to dhhs seeking documents
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
on precisely how the department would
 
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
implement opt out in the vaccine
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
registry it is clear that even as the
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
department brings the registry online it
 
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
has not yet implemented software
 
01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
features necessary to
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
guarantee even opt-out procedures
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman the vaccine registry is not
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
just for tracking vaccinations also
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
available for research in new hampshire
 
01:58:55.589 --> 01:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
today at dartmouth college vaccine
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
registered data from vermont is being
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
used by professor brendan nylen but his
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
research is not medical research
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
professor nylon is a political science
 
01:59:07.589 --> 01:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
researcher and his work involves using
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
people's private medical data records to
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
study how to step up to influence them
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
politically and how to bring their
 
01:59:16.709 --> 01:59:16.719 align:start position:0%
political views more closely in
 
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
alignment with public health goals
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
professor nylon's research has formed
 
01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
the basis of political attacks on
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
so-called vaccine resistors in new york
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr mcleod the chair

i'm speaking behalf on
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
today on behalf of the chapters
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
membership which consists of hundreds of
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
board-certified pediatricians from
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
across the state the new hampshire
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
chapter strongly opposes house bill 21.
 
02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh we are in agreement with the comments
 
02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
made by dr dailey and i will not repeat
 
02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
them however i will emphasize to the
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
committee that although the question was
 
02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
made as to the cost for individual
 
02:00:15.679 --> 02:00:17.189 align:start position:0%
made as to the cost for individual
practices

02:00:17.189 --> 02:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
practices
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
for implementing an opt
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
in or an opt-out strategy
 
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
medical practices are already very
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
pressed for time and the administrative
 
02:00:32.229 --> 02:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
burden of requiring signed form consent
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
of an additional document to be
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
printed and scanned into the medical
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
record as would be required by this bill
 
02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
would be another reason to oppose it
 
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
we believe that the passage of this bill
 
02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
would result in an impaired ability for
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
the state to
 
02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:50.310 align:start position:0%
the state to
adequately

02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
adequately
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
follow immunization status for public
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
health perspective
 
02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:57.830 align:start position:0%
health perspective
and

02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you doctor the chair now
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%

my name is marie ramos i'm a family
 
02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:21.679 align:start position:0%
physician and speaking on behalf of the
 
02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire medical society um in
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill
 
02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
um i want to
 
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
share and echo many of the sentiments
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
that were shared within our public
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
health leaders of the community but i
 
02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to share specifically my
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
experience as being a family doctor in
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
the state of california
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
working in a rural community
 
02:01:46.149 --> 02:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
at the time when i started my practice
 
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
of a town of 3000 the immunization rates
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
for the children were 30
 
02:01:54.070 --> 02:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
after the state of california in started
 
02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
a vaccine registry i was able to not
 
02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
only help our practice increase the
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates up to 80 percent but
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
also i was able to reduce the risk the
 
02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
amount of unnecessary repeated
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
vaccinations for our patients it's very
 
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
important to remember that during a
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
certain time in california
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
there were there was an outbreak of
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
measles and that was very true within
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
the little town that i worked in if it
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't for vaccinations not only myself
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
who was pregnant at the time but also
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
many of my patients who were sick and
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
ailing and couldn't get to specialists
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
within an hour
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
would have been at higher risk i strong
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you dr ramos the chair recognizes
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%

02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
the registry programs throughout the
 
02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
country and there are 49 other states
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
who have them
 
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh essentially will
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
assume that the public health benefit
 
02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
and confidential confidentiality
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
safeguards that these programs provide
 
02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh allow the states to safely and
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
ethically assume an implied consent to
 
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
people who
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
to the general public's enrolling
 
02:03:45.030 --> 02:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
in what is essentially op out programs
 
02:03:48.310 --> 02:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
in this time of coronavirus pandemic our
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
country is all too aware of the
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
importance of having a robust informed
 
02:03:55.350 --> 02:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
accountable public health infrastructure
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
to help us deal with any public health
 
02:03:57.599 --> 02:03:59.830 align:start position:0%
to help us deal with any public health
emergency

02:03:59.830 --> 02:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you dr hayes uh
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
christina are there any other members of
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
the public who have their hands raised
 
02:04:13.589 --> 02:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh yes we have eric power
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
well this is eric power i'm a resident
 
02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
of brookline
 
02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm in support of house bill 221.
 
02:04:30.149 --> 02:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
i think it's a very important
 
02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
bill to have an opt-in
 
02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of good reasons that have
 
02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
been stated for it
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to get out of a
 
02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh out of this process
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm also very concerned i heard one
 
02:04:44.550 --> 02:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
of the speakers talk about the
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination event a vaccination event
 
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
could be a refusal to have a vaccine i
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
was asked the doctor's office do i want
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
the shingles vaccine do i want the flu
 
02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:54.310 align:start position:0%
the shingles vaccine do i want the flu
vaccine

02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:04:56.070 --> 02:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned those those refusals will
 
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
be recorded and be part of this database
 
02:05:00.070 --> 02:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
to be used for whatever purpose
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
i think that there's a small cost for
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
this but i think it's a very small price
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
to pay for our privacy
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
and i think our privacy is very
 
02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:08.470 align:start position:0%
and i think our privacy is very
important

02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
i don't like the idea that we're having
 
02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
implied consent i think we need to have
 
02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:14.719 align:start position:0%
explicit consent to be having our data
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
be put into these databases to be used
 
02:05:19.030 --> 02:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
by the state and others
 
02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
and without our consent i think it's not
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate so i would urge ought to
 
02:05:26.470 --> 02:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
pass for house bill 221. thank you very
 
02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:28.470 align:start position:0%
pass for house bill 221. thank you very
much

02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you christina are there any other
 
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
members of the public who wish to speak
 
02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh yes we have quite a few uh we have
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
representative melissa blasek
 
02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr vice chair thank you
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i just wanted
 
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
to make a quick point currently as we
 
02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
speak the registry is not active meaning
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
no vaccine or person is currently being
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
tracked by this system
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
and i don't see the health of the public
 
02:05:58.470 --> 02:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
of this state suffering at all so i
 
02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
don't see the issue with airing on the
 
02:06:01.750 --> 02:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
side of freedom
 
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
we cannot trick the public into consent
 
02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
and people can be responsible for
 
02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
transferring their own medical records i
 
02:06:10.149 --> 02:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
actually resent the uh implications of
 
02:06:11.669 --> 02:06:11.679 align:start position:0%
some of the opposition testimony that
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
the public cannot practice personal
 
02:06:13.199 --> 02:06:14.709 align:start position:0%
the public cannot practice personal
responsibility

02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:06:17.189 --> 02:06:17.199 align:start position:0%

i understand your intentions to help us
 
02:07:20.709 --> 02:07:20.719 align:start position:0%

02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
your objectives
 
02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%

hi i'm here can you hear me
 
02:07:59.430 --> 02:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
yes we can
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh my name is kelly potenza and uh
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
resident of new hampshire i live in rye
 
02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:06.390 align:start position:0%
resident of new hampshire i live in rye
um

02:08:06.390 --> 02:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:07.589 align:start position:0%
um
basically

02:08:07.589 --> 02:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:08:10.069 --> 02:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a lot of testimony here
 
02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
that's talking about something that is
 
02:08:15.750 --> 02:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
truly um non-existent at this point so i
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
i think the point and i think the
 
02:08:20.069 --> 02:08:20.079 align:start position:0%
speaker was laura that was talking about
 
02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
it is this is something that's already
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
in place we are just supporting this so
 
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
it is basically this bill simply
 
02:08:33.750 --> 02:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
clarifies and explicitly states that the
 
02:08:36.550 --> 02:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry shall be an opt-in
 
02:08:40.149 --> 02:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
program so it's already
 
02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know the law is already there the
 
02:08:43.910 --> 02:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't change the law it just
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
clarifies it so i think that's the key
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
point here there's a lot of testimony
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
going on but the point is that and i
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
sent you guys an email that just clearly
 
02:08:57.589 --> 02:08:57.599 align:start position:0%
states this this bill just ensures that
 
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
the intent of this law is
 
02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
representative weber can you tell me who
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%

and i will promote people as you call
 
02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:53.360 align:start position:0%

the list
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%

television show mr t
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
i love it when the plan comes together
 
02:15:12.149 --> 02:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
well it's a plan anyway the execution
 
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
may be
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
marginally flawed but we'll we'll do our
 
02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:24.390 align:start position:0%
marginally flawed but we'll we'll do our
best

02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%

02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
just a little while ago in our email
 
02:15:34.270 --> 02:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
came an amendment to
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%

informed consent
 
02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
by way of background i agreed to sponsor
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 601 after i learned about a
 
02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
state contract awarded during the state
 
02:19:51.190 --> 02:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
of emergency
 
02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
that would create a new closed-loop
 
02:19:55.270 --> 02:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
referral system
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%

not-for-profits and private providers
 
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
into a database that allows them to
 
02:20:11.910 --> 02:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
share and retrieve personal information
 
02:20:13.990 --> 02:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
about new hampshire residents seeking

02:20:23.270 --> 02:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
to help with coordinating care
 
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
while this is certainly a worthwhile
 
02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:26.710 align:start position:0%
while this is certainly a worthwhile
goal

02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
goal
 
02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
i think the legislature should
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
understand how this system will work
 
02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
and what privacy protections will be in
 
02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
place in the database
 
02:20:38.469 --> 02:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
for individuals seeking services
 
02:20:40.150 --> 02:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
before the state created a vaccine
 
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
registry or prescription drug monitoring
 
02:20:47.349 --> 02:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
program privacy issues were discussed
 
02:20:49.750 --> 02:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
this database should not be different as
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
you may recall in 2018
 
02:20:55.349 --> 02:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire voters adopted a privacy
 
02:20:55.359 --> 02:20:56.630 align:start position:0%
new hampshire voters adopted a privacy
provision

02:20:56.630 --> 02:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
to the new hampshire constitution
 
02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
they did so
 
02:21:03.270 --> 02:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
by 81 percent of the voters
 
02:21:05.429 --> 02:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
and that reads an individual's right to
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
live free from governmental intrusion
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
and private and personal information
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
is natural essential and inherent
 
02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
those words don't protect themselves
 
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
it's up to the legislature the executive
 
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
branch the judicial branch to make sure
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
that those words adopted 81 percent by
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
our our constituents have effect when it
 
02:21:30.870 --> 02:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
deals with their personal information
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
we all have constituents who may be
 
02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
going through tough times and need
 
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
social services that could range
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere from food assistance
 
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
to housing assistance to other services
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
for child welfare and so on
 
02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
these constituents will now be added to
 
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
a database that will house their
 
02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
information for other social service
 
02:21:49.590 --> 02:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
providers to see and share
 
02:21:52.469 --> 02:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
a loosely defined network
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
from what i understand a person may sign
 
02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
only one consent form and that will
 
02:21:58.630 --> 02:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
allow their information to be shared
 
02:22:00.469 --> 02:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
beyond the agency actually providing
 
02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
them services
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
this committee is well versed in privacy
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
issues as they relate to health and
 
02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:07.830 align:start position:0%
issues as they relate to health and
human

02:22:07.830 --> 02:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
human
 
02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
there are questions that i think the
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
department should answer that would help
 
02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
us as legislators
 
02:22:15.190 --> 02:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
understand the new database program and
 
02:22:17.030 --> 02:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
what it may mean for our constituents
 
02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
and their privacy rights
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
here are three questions i hope the
 
02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
committee will have answered
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
question one
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
does the person seeking services know
 
02:22:29.510 --> 02:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
what information is being shared about
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
them to other organizations
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
for example is it household income
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
description of their issues or what
 
02:22:38.710 --> 02:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
other information
 
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
question two does the person seeking
 
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
services know when and how often their
 
02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
information will be looked up
 
02:22:48.309 --> 02:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
and which organizations specifically are
 
02:22:50.070 --> 02:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
accessing it that question deals with
 
02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
searchability of their information
 
02:22:55.030 --> 02:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
question three could the person seeking
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
services be turned down for services
 
02:22:59.670 --> 02:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
if they don't want their information to
 
02:23:01.750 --> 02:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
be in this database
 
02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
could they be denied services because
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:09.910 --> 02:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
moving on my intent is not to impede the
 
02:23:11.830 --> 02:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
work of the department or the services
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
provided to individuals needing
 
02:23:13.439 --> 02:23:15.030 align:start position:0%
provided to individuals needing
assistance

02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
my questions are raised by the
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
implementation of this new database
 
02:23:18.479 --> 02:23:19.510 align:start position:0%
implementation of this new database
system

02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:23:21.429 --> 02:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
and how it affects the services and
 
02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
privacy protections of our constituents
 
02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
in light of some of the concerns raised
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
about the bill as presented
 
02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
in light of the
 
02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:31.670 align:start position:0%
in light of the
concerns

02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
and i emailed this last night to the
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
committee about 7 p.m the draft
 
02:23:39.429 --> 02:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
and it was it was finalized uh a few few
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh 15 minutes ago or so by ols
 
02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
to address these concerns i had an
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
amendment drafted by ols for the
 
02:23:50.750 --> 02:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
2021-0253 h
 
02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:55.670 align:start position:0%
2021-0253 h
0253h

02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
0253h
 
02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment replaces the bill
 
02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
to specifically address two issues so
 
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
here's the differences
 
02:24:04.950 --> 02:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
first it would require an informed
 
02:24:07.750 --> 02:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
consent form for individuals each time
 
02:24:09.910 --> 02:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
their information is shared
 
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
so they can take control of protecting
 
02:24:11.840 --> 02:24:12.830 align:start position:0%
so they can take control of protecting
their

02:24:12.830 --> 02:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
privacy second it requires that services
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
can't be withheld if they choose not to
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
and the the draft amendment was sent to
 
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
i know our legislature and our
 
02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
constituents take privacy very seriously
 
02:24:37.750 --> 02:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
we set parameters to make sure agencies
 
02:24:39.750 --> 02:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
government agencies across the state use
 
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
private information in limited ways
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your expertise in reviewing
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
02:24:48.309 --> 02:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
there there are others who will be able
 
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
to speak more specifically to the
 
02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
language in the amendment that will come
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
after me so in conclusion i hope you
 
02:24:57.830 --> 02:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
would look favorably on house bill 601
 
02:24:59.030 --> 02:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for your time and i'm
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:06.630 --> 02:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
are there any members of the committee
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
who have a question of representative
 
02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:10.469 align:start position:0%
who have a question of representative
ammon

02:25:10.469 --> 02:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
ammon
 
02:25:12.790 --> 02:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro has his hand up
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
on screens representative shapiro
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:22.469 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
as you
 
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
know most medical practitioners
 
02:25:29.429 --> 02:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
operate under the
 
02:25:32.469 --> 02:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
health information portability and
 
02:25:39.990 --> 02:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
have you
 
02:25:44.950 --> 02:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:47.429 --> 02:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
the informed cons the specific informed
 
02:25:50.830 --> 02:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
consent in your bill would align or not
 
02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question uh it's my
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
understanding i'm not a medical
 
02:25:58.080 --> 02:25:59.270 align:start position:0%
understanding i'm not a medical
professional

02:25:59.270 --> 02:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
professional
 
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
that hipaa
 
02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's a federal
 
02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:03.270 align:start position:0%
it's a federal
federal

02:26:03.270 --> 02:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:04.630 align:start position:0%
federal
requirement

02:26:04.630 --> 02:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
02:26:07.429 --> 02:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
but it deals with patient privacy
 
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
02:26:11.590 --> 02:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
this bill deals with
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh a person's information in the social
 
02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
services system so it's
 
02:26:19.510 --> 02:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh i guess there would be some analogies
 
02:26:21.429 --> 02:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
between the two but i think this is a
 
02:26:22.950 --> 02:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
simpler issue
 
02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
as it deals with
 
02:26:26.710 --> 02:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
a person receiving social services
 
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
which which may or may not include
 
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
require hipaa compliance which would be
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
a separate issue that's my understanding
 
02:26:35.359 --> 02:26:36.469 align:start position:0%
a separate issue that's my understanding
follow-up

02:26:36.469 --> 02:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
um maybe i'm not
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
understanding completely but it does
 
02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:45.030 align:start position:0%
understanding completely but it does
seem

02:26:45.030 --> 02:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
seem
 
02:26:46.710 --> 02:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
that in the
 
02:26:48.550 --> 02:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
02:26:52.469 --> 02:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
on line 16 to 18 and 20 to 22 where you
 
02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
talk about a very specific consent form
 
02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:56.870 align:start position:0%
talk about a very specific consent form
um

02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:59.349 --> 02:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
that it includes health information as
 
02:27:02.469 --> 02:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
well as social service information
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
and i am
 
02:27:06.790 --> 02:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
specifically um concerned that these may
 
02:27:09.429 --> 02:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
be overly broad in giving permission to
 
02:27:11.110 --> 02:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
share information
 
02:27:14.830 --> 02:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
um they don't seem to um say
 
02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
specifically what organizations you're
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
could you comment on that
 
02:27:30.309 --> 02:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i could try i mean so the intent of
 
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
that form is any time uh a a new person
 
02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
comes into the system that their
 
02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:36.870 align:start position:0%
comes into the system that their
information

02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:38.070 align:start position:0%
information
uh

02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:40.389 --> 02:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
before their information is shared
 
02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
because we know once it's shared it's
 
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
hard to put it back in the box that they
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
would have to sign a consent and
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
the the differences between the two
 
02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:50.389 align:start position:0%
the the differences between the two
um

02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:50.399 --> 02:27:52.389 align:start position:0%
um
section

02:27:52.389 --> 02:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:27:56.389 --> 02:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm looking
 
02:27:59.359 --> 02:28:07.830 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm looking
uh

02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
the forms are identical one one section
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
deals with if you're presented in paper
 
02:28:14.790 --> 02:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
form the other is if you're presented in
 
02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
electronic form
 
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
the for the consent form would be filled
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
out before that information went to
 
02:28:27.349 --> 02:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
other agencies including the the ability
 
02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
to opt out
 
02:28:30.790 --> 02:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
so your question about hipaa i think is
 
02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
interesting because
 
02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:34.230 align:start position:0%
interesting because
there

02:28:34.230 --> 02:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:28:36.150 --> 02:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
might be some overlap depending on what
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
information is stored in this database
 
02:28:39.990 --> 02:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
that some of the information may also
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
have a hipaa component to it and i
 
02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't answer the specifics on that
 
02:28:45.190 --> 02:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
but you might want to ask
 
02:28:49.590 --> 02:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:51.670 --> 02:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
any other members of the committee
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman representative knark's
 
02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
hand is up
 
02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:02.870 align:start position:0%
hand is up
representative

02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:05.190 --> 02:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um i actually had a question
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
also about the uh forms that are printed
 
02:29:11.349 --> 02:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
since that says verbatim what the form
 
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
has to say
 
02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
i was concerned about the reading level
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
since we usually think about trying to
 
02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:17.270 align:start position:0%
since we usually think about trying to
write

02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
write
 
02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
documents for people at about a sixth to
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
eighth grade level and the question
 
02:29:23.670 --> 02:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
would be do we think that a the average
 
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
person will understand what a searchable
 
02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
database is particularly if they happen
 
02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
to perhaps be a little older with a gray
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
hair like we see in our committee
 
02:29:34.710 --> 02:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh that's a great question and i think
 
02:29:38.469 --> 02:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:40.389 --> 02:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
readability is uh
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
should definitely be as broad as
 
02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:43.590 align:start position:0%
should definitely be as broad as
possible

02:29:43.590 --> 02:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:45.510 align:start position:0%
possible
um

02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:47.110 --> 02:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
i'm a i'm actually a database
 
02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
professional so
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
i have a lot of experience
 
02:29:54.389 --> 02:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
designing and administering databases
 
02:29:57.429 --> 02:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
so maybe that was an oversight
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
do you have a suggestion for a different
 
02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
term the idea is that
 
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
the data can be stored but if it's
 
02:30:07.590 --> 02:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
if it's searchable
 
02:30:09.830 --> 02:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
then lots of agencies can access it
 
02:30:12.389 --> 02:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
because searchability means
 
02:30:14.550 --> 02:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's not just their name or some
 
02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:15.750 align:start position:0%
it's not just their name or some
identifier

02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
identifier
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
it could be searchable based on income
 
02:30:20.230 --> 02:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
level or
 
02:30:21.910 --> 02:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
what services they've received in the
 
02:30:23.190 --> 02:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
past right so
 
02:30:27.270 --> 02:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know harvesting data from the
 
02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:30.309 align:start position:0%
you know harvesting data from the
database

02:30:30.309 --> 02:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
database
 
02:30:32.230 --> 02:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
if it's not searchable then there would
 
02:30:33.349 --> 02:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
02:30:34.630 --> 02:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
a specific
 
02:30:36.870 --> 02:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
point of contact about that individual
 
02:30:38.550 --> 02:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
and that agency
 
02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh in order for that data to be shared
 
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
may i respond
 
02:30:46.479 --> 02:30:47.510 align:start position:0%
may i respond
or

02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:30:49.349 --> 02:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
i would just say that it is always a
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
difficulty if you are expert in this
 
02:30:53.349 --> 02:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to bring it to the right
 
02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
level we might want to get somebody else
 
02:30:56.469 --> 02:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
to look at it who doesn't understand it
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
and see what word would work for them
 
02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
but that's a different issue thank you
 
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i have representative nelson
 
02:31:09.190 --> 02:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
and then representative woods
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
and then representative cannon and then
 
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
02:31:17.190 --> 02:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:18.550 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
nelson

02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
nelson
 
02:31:20.790 --> 02:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i
 
02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
reading is over i just want to double
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
check on something
 
02:31:25.830 --> 02:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
personal information in the past we've
 
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
had committees for example have studied
 
02:31:30.070 --> 02:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
such things as
 
02:31:32.309 --> 02:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
somebody that has had an abortion not
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
the name of somebody but just
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
information to try to track how many
 
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
abortions are done in the state of
 
02:31:41.110 --> 02:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
would that
 
02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
number not the person's personal
 
02:31:47.110 --> 02:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
information be counted or be used or
 
02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
would prohibit them using the number of
 
02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:51.110 align:start position:0%
would prohibit them using the number of
abortions

02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
02:31:53.670 --> 02:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
as an example that's a controversial
 
02:31:55.270 --> 02:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
example but let's say it was some other
 
02:31:57.190 --> 02:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
issue like visiting a food bank or
 
02:31:58.870 --> 02:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
something right
 
02:31:58.880 --> 02:31:59.990 align:start position:0%
something right
this

02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:01.030 align:start position:0%
this
amendment

02:32:01.030 --> 02:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:32:03.510 --> 02:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
deals with personal personal
 
02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
identifiable information
 
02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:06.950 align:start position:0%
identifiable information
so

02:32:06.950 --> 02:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:09.990 --> 02:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
aggregating data across town county or
 
02:32:13.030 --> 02:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
whatever way you want to aggregate it
 
02:32:14.870 --> 02:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
if you aggregate it high enough you kind
 
02:32:14.880 --> 02:32:15.510 align:start position:0%
if you aggregate it high enough you kind
of

02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
it becomes non-identifiable
 
02:32:19.349 --> 02:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
and that would be a different issue that
 
02:32:22.469 --> 02:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
this bill is not trying to address
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's your
 
02:32:27.750 --> 02:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:29.670 --> 02:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:31.830 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
woods

02:32:31.830 --> 02:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
woods
 
02:32:33.910 --> 02:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
02:32:35.349 --> 02:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
representative amman for taking my
 
02:32:35.359 --> 02:32:36.389 align:start position:0%
representative amman for taking my
question

02:32:36.389 --> 02:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:32:38.070 --> 02:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get my arms around just
 
02:32:40.630 --> 02:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
exactly how this
 
02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
process would work
 
02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:44.950 align:start position:0%
under this bill
and

02:32:44.950 --> 02:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
the down perhaps downside and thinking
 
02:32:47.200 --> 02:32:48.230 align:start position:0%
the down perhaps downside and thinking
about

02:32:48.230 --> 02:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
an individual who
 
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
applies for a particular program
 
02:32:54.790 --> 02:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
a state program
 
02:32:56.469 --> 02:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
and then by chance
 
02:32:57.910 --> 02:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
wants to apply
 
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
someplace else for another state program
 
02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
does that mean they would have to
 
02:33:05.830 --> 02:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
go through the same process again
 
02:33:08.790 --> 02:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
if the agencies couldn't speak to one
 
02:33:08.800 --> 02:33:09.990 align:start position:0%
if the agencies couldn't speak to one
another

02:33:09.990 --> 02:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:33:11.270 --> 02:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
sort of like going to the doctor's
 
02:33:11.280 --> 02:33:12.309 align:start position:0%
sort of like going to the doctor's
office

02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
you were just there two days ago and
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
they want you to fill out all the forms
 
02:33:15.359 --> 02:33:16.630 align:start position:0%
they want you to fill out all the forms
again

02:33:16.630 --> 02:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:33:18.469 --> 02:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
in this situation sometimes the folks
 
02:33:21.670 --> 02:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
that need the services don't have access
 
02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:22.550 align:start position:0%
that need the services don't have access
to

02:33:22.550 --> 02:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:24.309 align:start position:0%
to
ready

02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
ready
 
02:33:24.319 --> 02:33:25.429 align:start position:0%
ready
online

02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
online
 
02:33:27.750 --> 02:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
filling out forms and we've seen the
 
02:33:29.910 --> 02:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
confusion with the covin program about
 
02:33:32.070 --> 02:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
people trying to get on so i'm trying to
 
02:33:35.110 --> 02:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
get my arms around how this is gonna
 
02:33:37.990 --> 02:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
play out in practice
 
02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to find a balance
 
02:33:46.070 --> 02:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
between two things one is uh
 
02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:47.510 align:start position:0%
between two things one is uh
the

02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:33:49.510 --> 02:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
the people receiving services their
 
02:33:50.870 --> 02:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
their rights is particularly the right
 
02:33:52.389 --> 02:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
to privacy
 
02:33:54.070 --> 02:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
and the efficiency of the system right
 
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
those two things
 
02:33:59.110 --> 02:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
are at odds and this bill
 
02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh puts a spotlight on the privacy issue
 
02:34:04.389 --> 02:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
because before now it hasn't been
 
02:34:04.399 --> 02:34:06.389 align:start position:0%
because before now it hasn't been
addressed

02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
02:34:08.070 --> 02:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
i think just on a higher level that's
 
02:34:11.670 --> 02:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
kind of what we're trying to look at
 
02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:13.910 align:start position:0%
kind of what we're trying to look at
here

02:34:13.910 --> 02:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:15.190 align:start position:0%
here
and

02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:18.630 --> 02:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
as legislators are both of those needs
 
02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
of our constituents uh
 
02:34:22.389 --> 02:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
are important
 
02:34:22.399 --> 02:34:23.910 align:start position:0%
are important
so

02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
that that's not just a high level like
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
introduction uh to
 
02:34:30.950 --> 02:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
how i think we're approaching this
 
02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:36.469 --> 02:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:34:38.950 --> 02:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
the consumer of the service
 
02:34:41.190 --> 02:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
basically can opt in
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
to this network
 
02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
and there's an issue with the definition
 
02:34:48.630 --> 02:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
of the network the network of providers
 
02:34:50.790 --> 02:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
that it's kind of loosely defined
 
02:34:53.349 --> 02:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
you know it can change over time
 
02:34:54.469 --> 02:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:34:56.870 --> 02:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
you might the network might have
 
02:34:59.429 --> 02:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
a certain number of providers in it
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
in at the current uh
 
02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:02.710 align:start position:0%
in at the current uh
time

02:35:02.710 --> 02:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:35:05.110 --> 02:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
but then over time that network grows
 
02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
and changes
 
02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:08.870 align:start position:0%
and changes
and

02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
if there is there are no privacy
 
02:35:10.319 --> 02:35:12.230 align:start position:0%
if there is there are no privacy
protections

02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
protections
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
not only don't you know who has your
 
02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:14.870 align:start position:0%
not only don't you know who has your
data

02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
currently but over time more and more
 
02:35:19.750 --> 02:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
providers or different providers can get
 
02:35:22.070 --> 02:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
access to that data
 
02:35:24.870 --> 02:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
so this bill is trying to put
 
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
a brief pause
 
02:35:29.190 --> 02:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
when that data moves that if you're
 
02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:30.630 align:start position:0%
when that data moves that if you're
uh

02:35:30.630 --> 02:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
consuming a service that you are at
 
02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
least informed and are given a chance to
 
02:35:38.870 --> 02:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
express your willingness to have your
 
02:35:43.830 --> 02:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:45.190 --> 02:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
does that make does that answer your
 
02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:46.309 align:start position:0%
does that make does that answer your
question

02:35:46.309 --> 02:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
that's the privacy concern that we're
 
02:35:49.990 --> 02:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
trying to address here
 
02:35:52.630 --> 02:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
the exact implementation
 
02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to predict i think you'll
 
02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
have the
 
02:35:57.830 --> 02:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
someone from i.t of health and human
 
02:35:57.840 --> 02:35:59.110 align:start position:0%
someone from i.t of health and human
services

02:35:59.110 --> 02:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
come behind me that might be a question
 
02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
for someone that uh understands
 
02:36:06.870 --> 02:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
better the implementation
 
02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:07.750 align:start position:0%
better the implementation
uh

02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
because i'm not familiar with that
 
02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:12.790 align:start position:0%
because i'm not familiar with that
directly

02:36:12.790 --> 02:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:15.510 --> 02:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:21.990 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
cannon

02:36:21.990 --> 02:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:24.230 --> 02:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and
 
02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:29.910 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:32.790 --> 02:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
as i was reading through the your this
 
02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:33.990 align:start position:0%
as i was reading through the your this
immense

02:36:33.990 --> 02:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
immense
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
amendment there are 17 mentions of
 
02:36:37.439 --> 02:36:38.790 align:start position:0%
amendment there are 17 mentions of
health

02:36:38.790 --> 02:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
and so i raised the question again
 
02:36:45.910 --> 02:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
about hipaa requirements as i just
 
02:36:47.830 --> 02:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
filled out a form
 
02:36:51.110 --> 02:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
um for my a therapist and
 
02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
psychologist to send information along
 
02:36:55.830 --> 02:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
and i had to identify
 
02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:56.630 align:start position:0%
and i had to identify
these

02:36:56.630 --> 02:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:36:59.190 --> 02:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
specific things i would allow to be
 
02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
transferred from the their office
 
02:37:05.030 --> 02:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
and who they were and who i was
 
02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
transferring that information to
 
02:37:10.230 --> 02:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
and there's no way there's nowhere in
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
this particular document
 
02:37:15.750 --> 02:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
that is as specific as the hipaa
 
02:37:18.070 --> 02:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
requirements that were on that form were
 
02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:19.110 align:start position:0%
requirements that were on that form were
met

02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
met
 
02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:20.150 align:start position:0%
met
so

02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:37:23.190 --> 02:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm wondering if another amendment
 
02:37:24.790 --> 02:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
would be coming
 
02:37:28.469 --> 02:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
for this bill that would let us know how
 
02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
this differs from what our
 
02:37:31.359 --> 02:37:35.429 align:start position:0%
this differs from what our
hipaa

02:37:35.429 --> 02:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
requirements are
 
02:37:40.550 --> 02:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great question this is not
 
02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:42.630 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great question this is not
as

02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:37:45.030 --> 02:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
as granular as the hippo requirements
 
02:37:47.670 --> 02:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
this is more of just a
 
02:37:49.830 --> 02:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
catch-all opt-in or out
 
02:37:51.990 --> 02:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
so there's three versions of this
 
02:37:54.309 --> 02:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
i i give my consent
 
02:37:57.190 --> 02:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
share share my data with who you will
 
02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
the second is i give my consent but it
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
should not be searchable
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
and the third is i do not give my
 
02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:04.309 align:start position:0%
and the third is i do not give my
consent

02:38:04.309 --> 02:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
consent
 
02:38:05.830 --> 02:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
for my data to be shared and it's
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
specifically talking about this new
 
02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:09.670 align:start position:0%
specifically talking about this new
database

02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
database
 
02:38:12.389 --> 02:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh this closed-loop referral system that
 
02:38:12.399 --> 02:38:13.590 align:start position:0%
uh this closed-loop referral system that
uh

02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
the data will be centrally housed by
 
02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't know the extent that it's
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
going to be shared with other agencies
 
02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:22.389 align:start position:0%
going to be shared with other agencies
but

02:38:22.389 --> 02:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:38:24.150 --> 02:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
the you know the central store of the
 
02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
data uh will be with health and human
 
02:38:30.070 --> 02:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
services and
 
02:38:31.349 --> 02:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
they will be
 
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
in my understanding controlling access
 
02:38:35.750 --> 02:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
to that data by other
 
02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:39.590 align:start position:0%
to that data by other
organizations

02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:40.830 --> 02:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:38:45.750 --> 02:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and also thank
 
02:38:48.790 --> 02:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:38:50.469 --> 02:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:38:53.510 --> 02:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh more of a practical side
 
02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
when i see things that are in statute
 
02:38:58.630 --> 02:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
language dealing with a foreign
 
02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:00.389 align:start position:0%
language dealing with a foreign
specifically

02:39:00.389 --> 02:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:39:01.590 --> 02:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
what history's
 
02:39:03.030 --> 02:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
shown me is that once something gets
 
02:39:04.469 --> 02:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
into statute it's very difficult to
 
02:39:08.230 --> 02:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
change it and over time things do
 
02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
change and it's very difficult to keep
 
02:39:11.670 --> 02:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
up with the change because it's in
 
02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:13.270 align:start position:0%
up with the change because it's in
statute

02:39:13.270 --> 02:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
any reason to why it's in statute versus
 
02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
requiring the agency to have rulemaking
 
02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:19.030 align:start position:0%
requiring the agency to have rulemaking
authority

02:39:19.030 --> 02:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
authority
 
02:39:21.190 --> 02:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
to create rules around the particular
 
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
consent forms
 
02:39:26.469 --> 02:39:26.479 align:start position:0%
as an option versus putting in a statue
 
02:39:29.110 --> 02:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question um
 
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
one one of the reasons why the language
 
02:39:33.990 --> 02:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
for those forms was kept very simple
 
02:39:35.830 --> 02:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
and and uh you know targeted to the
 
02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:37.110 align:start position:0%
and and uh you know targeted to the
point

02:39:37.110 --> 02:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
um dealing with privacy
 
02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
and efficiency
 
02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
those two things being at odds um
 
02:39:47.830 --> 02:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's sometimes in the interest of a
 
02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:49.830 align:start position:0%
it's sometimes in the interest of a
bureaucracy

02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy
 
02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:50.710 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy
to

02:39:50.710 --> 02:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
put privacy
 
02:39:54.550 --> 02:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh secondary to efficiency because it's
 
02:39:57.590 --> 02:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
less work it's less less things to do
 
02:39:57.600 --> 02:39:58.550 align:start position:0%
less work it's less less things to do
right

02:39:58.550 --> 02:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:40:00.550 --> 02:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
and so that's why it's important to have
 
02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:01.750 align:start position:0%
and so that's why it's important to have
this

02:40:01.750 --> 02:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:40:04.469 --> 02:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
in statute because it gives the
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
legislature control over
 
02:40:09.030 --> 02:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
that balance between privacy and
 
02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:10.389 align:start position:0%
that balance between privacy and
efficiency

02:40:10.389 --> 02:40:10.399 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
02:40:11.830 --> 02:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that there's language
 
02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
that says
 
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
those words uh
 
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
that the the the agency can't
 
02:40:22.150 --> 02:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
try to talk a person in or out of
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
any of those options
 
02:40:26.309 --> 02:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
so that it should be
 
02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
up to the individual to make the
 
02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
decision and not be coached
 
02:40:31.670 --> 02:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
one way or the other
 
02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
when they make that decision
 
02:40:35.429 --> 02:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:40:38.389 --> 02:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank
 
02:40:41.750 --> 02:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative again
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch does have sort of
 
02:40:45.429 --> 02:40:45.439 align:start position:0%
an oversight
 
02:40:48.070 --> 02:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
legislatively on agencies with
 
02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority
 
02:40:52.150 --> 02:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
so therefore that agency has some
 
02:40:55.349 --> 02:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
control over how the rules are written
 
02:40:57.110 --> 02:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
i just concern myself with something in
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
the statute i hear you concern about
 
02:41:03.190 --> 02:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
the government overreach but there is
 
02:41:05.190 --> 02:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
checks and balances i think built into
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
the process through gel cart to allow
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
for an agency to write the rules and
 
02:41:11.590 --> 02:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
also for legislative branch to review
 
02:41:13.110 --> 02:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
those rules that are written
 
02:41:14.550 --> 02:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's just more of a comment than a
 
02:41:16.150 --> 02:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
question but would you be opposed again
 
02:41:19.110 --> 02:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
back to the issue of um knowing the fact
 
02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
that jail car is there to protect the
 
02:41:24.309 --> 02:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
legislative body in the public at large
 
02:41:27.190 --> 02:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
if if jail car would
 
02:41:29.590 --> 02:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
have the option to approve the specific
 
02:41:31.349 --> 02:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
language of the form then i would not be
 
02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to that but if it's something
 
02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:33.990 align:start position:0%
opposed to that but if it's something
that

02:41:33.990 --> 02:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:41:35.830 --> 02:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know disappears into the fog and
 
02:41:37.670 --> 02:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
never gets seen again
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
and can change without oversight then i
 
02:41:41.190 --> 02:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
would be opposed to that so
 
02:41:42.550 --> 02:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:41:44.550 --> 02:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
this is uh chairman
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
mark pearson i chair the new hampshire
 
02:41:49.750 --> 02:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
commission on deafness and hearing loss
 
02:41:52.870 --> 02:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
and it seems that at every meeting
 
02:41:56.550 --> 02:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
people are asking we don't know
 
02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
how many deaf deafblind hard of hearing
 
02:42:02.150 --> 02:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
people there are in the state how do we
 
02:42:04.230 --> 02:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
collect that information
 
02:42:06.150 --> 02:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
on the other hand i'm aware of an
 
02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:07.830 align:start position:0%
on the other hand i'm aware of an
individual

02:42:07.830 --> 02:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:42:10.790 --> 02:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
who is a constituent of someone else
 
02:42:13.349 --> 02:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
who is totally blind has a dog has a
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
white cane with a red tip and really
 
02:42:19.190 --> 02:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't want anybody to know he's blind
 
02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:20.389 align:start position:0%
doesn't want anybody to know he's blind
um

02:42:20.389 --> 02:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
how does your
 
02:42:24.630 --> 02:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
amended bill
 
02:42:27.429 --> 02:42:27.439 align:start position:0%
strike that appropriate balance so my
 
02:42:30.309 --> 02:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
commission can start to get the data it
 
02:42:33.190 --> 02:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
needs to make its decisions while
 
02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:34.389 align:start position:0%
needs to make its decisions while
protecting

02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
02:42:34.399 --> 02:42:35.750 align:start position:0%
protecting
individual

02:42:35.750 --> 02:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:42:39.670 --> 02:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
well if if the person and and i'd
 
02:42:43.830 --> 02:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
imagine the form would be presented in
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
braille for the for the blind um the
 
02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:47.190 align:start position:0%
braille for the for the blind um the
person

02:42:47.190 --> 02:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:42:49.510 --> 02:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
would have a chance to opt out of having
 
02:42:51.429 --> 02:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
their data shared
 
02:42:51.439 --> 02:42:52.710 align:start position:0%
their data shared
um

02:42:52.710 --> 02:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:55.990 --> 02:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
is it is it in a central location uh in
 
02:42:57.910 --> 02:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
in one location just not shareable with
 
02:42:57.920 --> 02:42:58.950 align:start position:0%
in one location just not shareable with
other

02:42:58.950 --> 02:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:43:01.750 --> 02:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh providers in the network i'd i'd have
 
02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
to ask dhs
 
02:43:05.349 --> 02:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
about that but
 
02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
the question that you're asking again i
 
02:43:10.389 --> 02:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
think deals with aggregated data
 
02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
which if you you know if you aggregate
 
02:43:12.240 --> 02:43:13.190 align:start position:0%
which if you you know if you aggregate
it

02:43:13.190 --> 02:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
if there's only one blind person in a
 
02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
town and you aggregate it to that town
 
02:43:18.950 --> 02:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
then you're pretty much identifying that
 
02:43:21.110 --> 02:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
one person there's no
 
02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
you're not uh you're not protecting
 
02:43:25.590 --> 02:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
their privacy most people in that time
 
02:43:28.710 --> 02:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh but well
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
they're not government agents
 
02:43:35.190 --> 02:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
most likely you're right
 
02:43:38.150 --> 02:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
02:43:40.469 --> 02:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
so um but if you aggregate it to a
 
02:43:42.950 --> 02:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
county or some higher level then
 
02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
it protects the individual's privacy
 
02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:45.910 align:start position:0%
it protects the individual's privacy
um

02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:45.920 --> 02:43:47.190 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:43:48.630 --> 02:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
and so i think if you wanted to know how
 
02:43:51.429 --> 02:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
many blind people were in the state it's
 
02:43:54.870 --> 02:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
you can do that while protecting privacy
 
02:43:57.030 --> 02:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
would your bill follow up with your bill
 
02:43:59.510 --> 02:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
help or hinder that or is it neutral to
 
02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:00.630 align:start position:0%
help or hinder that or is it neutral to
that

02:44:00.630 --> 02:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:44:03.269 --> 02:44:03.279 align:start position:0%
i believe it's neutral
 
02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
and again if if your constituent who is
 
02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:07.590 align:start position:0%
and again if if your constituent who is
blind

02:44:07.590 --> 02:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
blind
 
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to tell anyone that he's
 
02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:10.710 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to tell anyone that he's
blind

02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
blind
 
02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:11.910 align:start position:0%
blind
um

02:44:11.910 --> 02:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:13.830 --> 02:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
and doesn't doesn't
 
02:44:16.389 --> 02:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
want people to invade their privacy
 
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
what what job is it
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
of the government
 
02:44:22.630 --> 02:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
to invade that person's privacy
 
02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:23.590 align:start position:0%
to invade that person's privacy
right

02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:44:25.750 --> 02:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
like in a free society you don't get
 
02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
perfect order you get
 
02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:28.790 align:start position:0%
perfect order you get
uh

02:44:28.790 --> 02:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
you get people complying
 
02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
voluntarily and you do the best that you
 
02:44:34.070 --> 02:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
can with the data that you're able to
 
02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:35.750 align:start position:0%
can with the data that you're able to
collect

02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
collect
 
02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer before you
 
02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:40.550 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer before you
go

02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:44:43.670 --> 02:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned the word amendment
 
02:44:44.790 --> 02:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
since i
 
02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
decide when bills get exact or
 
02:44:49.830 --> 02:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
um not
 
02:44:53.990 --> 02:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
are you open to us waiting on this
 
02:44:58.150 --> 02:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
so that an amendment might be offered
 
02:44:59.590 --> 02:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not a post and i'm sorry if i
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
overstepped i meant draft amendment um
 
02:45:03.510 --> 02:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
no you didn't no
 
02:45:05.750 --> 02:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
you didn't um
 
02:45:08.389 --> 02:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
i i'm not opposed uh i guess if we wait
 
02:45:10.389 --> 02:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
too long then the horse will be out of
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
the barn right so
 
02:45:13.590 --> 02:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
i think i think we need to address the
 
02:45:15.910 --> 02:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
privacy issue up front before the system
 
02:45:17.269 --> 02:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
gets going
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
because uh if you wait until
 
02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
the data is flowing and you don't know
 
02:45:24.630 --> 02:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
exactly who it's being shared with then
 
02:45:25.990 --> 02:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's kind of hard to put that back in
 
02:45:28.070 --> 02:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
the bottle so i think we have some time
 
02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:29.269 align:start position:0%
the bottle so i think we have some time
but

02:45:29.269 --> 02:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:45:31.429 --> 02:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
i wasn't planning on waiting very long
 
02:45:33.030 --> 02:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
we have to get everything out the door
 
02:45:35.830 --> 02:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
by the middle of march anyway
 
02:45:37.750 --> 02:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
no the opposition then thank you thank
 
02:45:40.550 --> 02:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
you representative canark
 
02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:41.269 align:start position:0%
you representative canark
uh

02:45:41.269 --> 02:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:45:41.279 --> 02:45:42.469 align:start position:0%
uh
yes

02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:45:42.479 --> 02:45:43.750 align:start position:0%
yes
yeah

02:45:43.750 --> 02:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:45:45.910 --> 02:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
just a very quick question you commented
 
02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
and my apologies if i missed the name
 
02:45:49.590 --> 02:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
earlier you've commented about this
 
02:45:51.349 --> 02:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
database what is the name of this
 
02:45:53.030 --> 02:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
database that we're discussing that
 
02:45:55.030 --> 02:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
you're concerned about
 
02:45:57.670 --> 02:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh the name that i have uh that i was
 
02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
made aware of is the close loop referral
 
02:46:02.230 --> 02:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
system uh
 
02:46:04.469 --> 02:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
now i don't know if that's the specific
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
project name for the database there
 
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
might be some uh
 
02:46:09.269 --> 02:46:09.279 align:start position:0%
some other name that they're using
 
02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
internally but that's that's what i'm
 
02:46:12.710 --> 02:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
referring to it as
 
02:46:14.309 --> 02:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
02:46:14.319 --> 02:46:15.510 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
follow-up

02:46:15.510 --> 02:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
just a real quick thing i got an email
 
02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
and it was a little bit unclear there
 
02:46:21.510 --> 02:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
was some kind of a company called ant
 
02:46:22.870 --> 02:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
bertha that sounded like they were
 
02:46:24.790 --> 02:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
weighing in on this have they been
 
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
involved in this uh effort of yours or
 
02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:28.070 align:start position:0%
involved in this uh effort of yours or
not

02:46:28.070 --> 02:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:46:29.830 --> 02:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
no i i do not know
 
02:46:31.750 --> 02:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
that company you might want to ask them
 
02:46:34.550 --> 02:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:37.590 --> 02:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and see no additional members
 
02:46:39.990 --> 02:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.070 align:start position:0%
of the committee
except

02:46:42.070 --> 02:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
except
 
02:46:44.790 --> 02:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
for representative gay
 
02:46:47.110 --> 02:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman and
 
02:46:49.670 --> 02:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i i have
 
02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
actually two questions one i'm trying to
 
02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:54.150 align:start position:0%
actually two questions one i'm trying to
identify

02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
identify
 
02:46:57.830 --> 02:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
what data we can keep totally separate
 
02:47:00.550 --> 02:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
and what data can go on the database so
 
02:47:03.030 --> 02:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's my first question can the social
 
02:47:05.269 --> 02:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
worker or whoever else is providing a
 
02:47:05.279 --> 02:47:06.389 align:start position:0%
worker or whoever else is providing a
service

02:47:06.389 --> 02:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:47:09.830 --> 02:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
send a person's records to another
 
02:47:09.840 --> 02:47:11.110 align:start position:0%
send a person's records to another
provider

02:47:11.110 --> 02:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
provider
 
02:47:14.710 --> 02:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that they can
 
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
send it as a packet rather than
 
02:47:20.710 --> 02:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
oh here's the database just look them up
 
02:47:23.269 --> 02:47:23.279 align:start position:0%
so that's question one
 
02:47:25.670 --> 02:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
and then question two
 
02:47:27.510 --> 02:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
would be there's some way to put a
 
02:47:31.030 --> 02:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
column of shareable data that like for
 
02:47:33.830 --> 02:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
aggregated accounts like blind this
 
02:47:37.030 --> 02:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
person is blind so that it's not tied
 
02:47:38.230 --> 02:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
at all
 
02:47:40.150 --> 02:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
to the person maybe it's going to be
 
02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
tied except
 
02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
if somebody's not honest
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
but those are my two questions can you
 
02:47:50.950 --> 02:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
you do have to share the data about
 
02:47:53.110 --> 02:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
people because they're usually not taken
 
02:47:55.349 --> 02:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
care of by one
 
02:47:58.070 --> 02:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
one service it sounds like it's linked
 
02:48:00.630 --> 02:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
to others so is it possible to do that
 
02:48:02.150 --> 02:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
without just putting them in the
 
02:48:03.510 --> 02:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
database and
 
02:48:05.830 --> 02:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
making the database accessible
 
02:48:08.950 --> 02:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
to the other service provider
 
02:48:11.110 --> 02:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's the the first part of
 
02:48:13.110 --> 02:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
that or the for your first question is
 
02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
interesting because um
 
02:48:16.950 --> 02:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
if you have a central repository meaning
 
02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
that there's one database
 
02:48:20.389 --> 02:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a web portal or some way
 
02:48:24.309 --> 02:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:27.510 --> 02:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's one point of failure as far as
 
02:48:29.830 --> 02:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
the data being hacked even so the
 
02:48:34.389 --> 02:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:35.429 --> 02:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
sending the data copies of the data
 
02:48:40.469 --> 02:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
to different organizations and now
 
02:48:42.469 --> 02:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
they're housing the data
 
02:48:43.510 --> 02:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know you see what i mean that now
 
02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:44.389 align:start position:0%
you know you see what i mean that now
there's

02:48:44.389 --> 02:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
copies of of the data all over
 
02:48:50.790 --> 02:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
with different providers now your
 
02:48:52.630 --> 02:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
attack surface
 
02:48:55.590 --> 02:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
for that data to be exposed to the
 
02:48:59.190 --> 02:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
internet or the dark web grows
 
02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:00.070 align:start position:0%
internet or the dark web grows
because

02:49:00.070 --> 02:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:49:01.910 --> 02:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
now you don't you don't have a
 
02:49:03.750 --> 02:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
control over
 
02:49:06.150 --> 02:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
the security of that data it could be
 
02:49:08.309 --> 02:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
you know in emails
 
02:49:10.389 --> 02:49:10.399 align:start position:0%
or documents on hard drives that might
 
02:49:13.110 --> 02:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
be accessed so that's another concern
 
02:49:14.950 --> 02:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's the way i hear your first
 
02:49:17.590 --> 02:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
question is that what you're asking
 
02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:18.389 align:start position:0%
question is that what you're asking
oh

02:49:18.389 --> 02:49:18.399 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:49:18.399 --> 02:49:19.750 align:start position:0%
oh
follow-up

02:49:19.750 --> 02:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:49:22.630 --> 02:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
it says you one of the options is you
 
02:49:25.349 --> 02:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
may share my personal information with
 
02:49:28.150 --> 02:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
any other public or private health or
 
02:49:31.349 --> 02:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
social service agency in this or any
 
02:49:33.590 --> 02:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
other state you just can't include it on
 
02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
a surgical database so that means
 
02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:36.790 align:start position:0%
a surgical database so that means
somehow

02:49:36.790 --> 02:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
02:49:39.590 --> 02:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
somehow we have to make it possible
 
02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:40.790 align:start position:0%
somehow we have to make it possible
to

02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:49:45.750 --> 02:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
share the records with another provider
 
02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:46.870 align:start position:0%
share the records with another provider
so

02:49:46.870 --> 02:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:48.950 --> 02:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
is is it possible
 
02:49:50.950 --> 02:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
just to give people permission to
 
02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:52.630 align:start position:0%
just to give people permission to
certain

02:49:52.630 --> 02:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
certain
 
02:49:54.790 --> 02:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
certain data i mean they have to get it
 
02:49:57.910 --> 02:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
it says i give you may share my personal
 
02:50:01.030 --> 02:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
information so how do you protect that
 
02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
when you share it with another provider
 
02:50:08.070 --> 02:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
without making the database open to
 
02:50:09.990 --> 02:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
everyone accessible
 
02:50:11.429 --> 02:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
you know i don't have a great answer to
 
02:50:13.590 --> 02:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
that because i don't know the specific
 
02:50:15.890 --> 02:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
implementation in mind um
 
02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:17.030 align:start position:0%
implementation in mind um
[Music]

02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:50:18.550 --> 02:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean it depends on how
 
02:50:21.349 --> 02:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
the system is structured
 
02:50:24.630 --> 02:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
this is more coming from like the
 
02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
the uh consumer
 
02:50:28.710 --> 02:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
viewpoint you know how they interact
 
02:50:30.150 --> 02:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
with the system and that's why it
 
02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
focuses on those consent forms so i i
 
02:50:33.990 --> 02:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't answer but you might want to
 
02:50:35.750 --> 02:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
ask someone from it and they could have
 
02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:41.429 --> 02:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
with no further questions from the
 
02:50:41.439 --> 02:50:42.389 align:start position:0%
with no further questions from the
committee

02:50:42.389 --> 02:50:42.399 align:start position:0%

second name again so i can find it
 
02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:38.230 --> 02:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
first of all i believe i've promoted
 
02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
both of them thank you
 
02:51:43.590 --> 02:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
when we were reviewing this piece of
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
legislation it was unclear to us exactly
 
02:51:50.230 --> 02:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
what it was aimed at initially
 
02:51:52.710 --> 02:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's very broadly written and it applies
 
02:51:54.550 --> 02:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
to every health and social service
 
02:51:57.269 --> 02:51:57.279 align:start position:0%
agency private for-profit
 
02:51:58.790 --> 02:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
or non-profit
 
02:52:00.870 --> 02:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
and it refers to the sharing of
 
02:52:02.870 --> 02:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
information between providers that could
 
02:52:04.950 --> 02:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
include any hospital social service
 
02:52:07.190 --> 02:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
agency pharmacy
 
02:52:09.990 --> 02:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh insurance company when it in and as
 
02:52:12.070 --> 02:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
written and as including the proposed
 
02:52:14.150 --> 02:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
amendment would apply to the entire
 
02:52:16.469 --> 02:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
health care system and not as is not
 
02:52:17.830 --> 02:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
directed at department of health and
 
02:52:19.750 --> 02:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
human services
 
02:52:21.429 --> 02:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
we already have a
 
02:52:23.510 --> 02:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
fragmented disorganized health care
 
02:52:26.309 --> 02:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
system and efforts are obviously trying
 
02:52:28.150 --> 02:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
to be done to decrease the burden on
 
02:52:30.309 --> 02:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
citizens to have their health care needs
 
02:52:30.319 --> 02:52:31.269 align:start position:0%
citizens to have their health care needs
met

02:52:31.269 --> 02:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
met
 
02:52:34.150 --> 02:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
this bill will further
 
02:52:36.950 --> 02:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
fragment the system and therefore dhhs
 
02:52:38.710 --> 02:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
is opposed to this bill
 
02:52:40.630 --> 02:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
we believe it would increase cost to the
 
02:52:43.510 --> 02:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
state decrease the coordination of care
 
02:52:45.510 --> 02:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
among health care providers and social
 
02:52:47.830 --> 02:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
service agencies and it conflicts with
 
02:52:49.830 --> 02:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
other laws and mandates both state and
 
02:52:49.840 --> 02:52:51.030 align:start position:0%
other laws and mandates both state and
nationally

02:52:51.030 --> 02:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
nationally
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
it impairs our ability to respond to
 
02:52:54.710 --> 02:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
emergencies and there are a number of
 
02:52:56.630 --> 02:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
provisions about this bill
 
02:52:59.510 --> 02:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
that would cause significant harm to our
 
02:53:01.590 --> 02:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable citizens
 
02:53:03.429 --> 02:53:03.439 align:start position:0%
i will defer to
 
02:53:04.710 --> 02:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
david weeder as a director of
 
02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
information services regarding
 
02:53:06.800 --> 02:53:09.349 align:start position:0%
information services regarding
this

02:53:09.349 --> 02:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:11.429 --> 02:53:11.439 align:start position:0%
reference to the closed loop referral
 
02:53:14.150 --> 02:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
platform not a searchable database
 
02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:14.870 align:start position:0%
platform not a searchable database
and

02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:53:18.150 --> 02:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
you also recognize that the committee uh
 
02:53:19.750 --> 02:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
has heard testimony
 
02:53:20.790 --> 02:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:53:20.800 --> 02:53:24.630 align:start position:0%
that the
um

02:53:24.630 --> 02:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:26.150 --> 02:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this legislation does not
 
02:53:29.590 --> 02:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
know how this the specifics uh
 
02:53:31.910 --> 02:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
of what this proposed platform isn't
 
02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
being interpreted at or implemented as
 
02:53:36.630 --> 02:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
therefore we have not been involved with
 
02:53:39.670 --> 02:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
this discussion about how this bill the
 
02:53:41.349 --> 02:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
intent behind this bill
 
02:53:42.630 --> 02:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
came about
 
02:53:44.790 --> 02:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
a few very specific situations that i
 
02:53:46.469 --> 02:53:46.479 align:start position:0%
read when i first read this bill that
 
02:53:49.750 --> 02:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
made me very worried mainly as a medical
 
02:53:49.760 --> 02:53:50.870 align:start position:0%
made me very worried mainly as a medical
provider

02:53:50.870 --> 02:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
provider
 
02:53:53.590 --> 02:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
i am a doctor for children and adults
 
02:53:57.190 --> 02:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
and when i see children if for example
 
02:53:58.870 --> 02:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
i had a child that i was seeing with a
 
02:54:00.070 --> 02:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
broken arm
 
02:54:02.469 --> 02:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
and i was suspecting of child abuse
 
02:54:04.230 --> 02:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
if this bill were implemented my
 
02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation of it would be that i
 
02:54:09.190 --> 02:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
could not report this child's potential
 
02:54:10.950 --> 02:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
neglect or abuse
 
02:54:13.429 --> 02:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
to a social service agency without the
 
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
potential abusers consent
 
02:54:17.830 --> 02:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
i felt very concerned about this bill as
 
02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:19.510 align:start position:0%
i felt very concerned about this bill as
britain

02:54:19.510 --> 02:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
britain
 
02:54:24.070 --> 02:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
also i was concerned about the ada uh
 
02:54:26.550 --> 02:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
compatibility of this bill
 
02:54:28.230 --> 02:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
requiring written signatures and no
 
02:54:30.070 --> 02:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
other options available
 
02:54:33.190 --> 02:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
also in the era of covet 19 a
 
02:54:35.429 --> 02:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
hard written consent as well as more
 
02:54:35.439 --> 02:54:36.550 align:start position:0%
hard written consent as well as more
paperwork

02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:37.429 align:start position:0%
paperwork
was

02:54:37.429 --> 02:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
written paper and touching of surfaces
 
02:54:41.429 --> 02:54:41.439 align:start position:0%
in close proximity made me more
 
02:54:43.110 --> 02:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
concerned as well
 
02:54:45.510 --> 02:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
i was also concerned about fraud
 
02:54:47.269 --> 02:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
the abuse of this law
 
02:54:48.870 --> 02:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
how does how would these signatures be
 
02:54:50.870 --> 02:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
verified and how would they be
 
02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:54.550 align:start position:0%
verified and how would they be
interpreted

02:54:54.550 --> 02:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:56.389 --> 02:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
when there's an open investigation of
 
02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
neglect and abuse that's happening if
 
02:55:02.710 --> 02:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:04.309 --> 02:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
it seems like it would be an impediment
 
02:55:06.230 --> 02:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
to provide services and coordinating of
 
02:55:10.630 --> 02:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:12.630 --> 02:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
the no exceptions rule there's no
 
02:55:14.150 --> 02:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
exceptions at all written into this
 
02:55:17.750 --> 02:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
legislation for emergencies or harm
 
02:55:18.950 --> 02:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
to a person
 
02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
if the information is not
 
02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:22.630 align:start position:0%
if the information is not
shared

02:55:22.630 --> 02:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
shared
 
02:55:25.030 --> 02:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
it conflicts with our state laws for
 
02:55:26.630 --> 02:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporting of infectious
 
02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:28.950 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporting of infectious
diseases

02:55:28.950 --> 02:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
02:55:32.630 --> 02:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
it also conflicts with other mandatory
 
02:55:34.469 --> 02:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:41.110 --> 02:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
i think with that i would like to defer
 
02:55:43.110 --> 02:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
it to mr david weeders our director of
 
02:55:45.030 --> 02:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
information services to
 
02:55:47.990 --> 02:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
potentially respond to some of the
 
02:55:50.950 --> 02:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:53.110 --> 02:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and
 
02:55:54.950 --> 02:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee
 
02:55:54.960 --> 02:55:55.910 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee
and

02:55:55.910 --> 02:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:55:58.309 --> 02:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
dr ballard just to add on to his
 
02:56:01.590 --> 02:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
comments as a overarching nature
 
02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:03.030 align:start position:0%
comments as a overarching nature
the

02:56:03.030 --> 02:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:56:05.190 --> 02:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
the other components of this is the
 
02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
increased cost to not just the one
 
02:56:09.510 --> 02:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
system that were referred to in the
 
02:56:11.750 --> 02:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
conversation today but since this is a
 
02:56:14.070 --> 02:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
broad legislation it would impact all of
 
02:56:16.790 --> 02:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
our systems of sharing of information
 
02:56:19.670 --> 02:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
for both in emergency as well as
 
02:56:21.429 --> 02:56:21.439 align:start position:0%
continued sharing with our federal
 
02:56:23.190 --> 02:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
partners as well
 
02:56:25.510 --> 02:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
so those systems costs would need to be
 
02:56:28.150 --> 02:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
contemplated and are not funded in this
 
02:56:30.070 --> 02:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
in this bill at this point
 
02:56:33.110 --> 02:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
those costs could if if left at a broad
 
02:56:35.110 --> 02:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
state could be more than a million
 
02:56:37.510 --> 02:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
dollars in general funds to the various
 
02:56:39.269 --> 02:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
of systems that we would need to
 
02:56:41.510 --> 02:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
accommodate the three different options
 
02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
of opt-in opt-out functionality
 
02:56:47.670 --> 02:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the closed-loop
 
02:56:49.110 --> 02:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
referral system
 
02:56:51.349 --> 02:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
that we are moving forward to increase
 
02:56:54.630 --> 02:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
the care coordination across our state
 
02:56:57.910 --> 02:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
it is definitely our intent and to have
 
02:57:00.230 --> 02:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
a very solid data governance strategy
 
02:57:02.070 --> 02:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
which is a strategy
 
02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:02.870 align:start position:0%
which is a strategy
in

02:57:02.870 --> 02:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:57:04.790 --> 02:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
in its speak
 
02:57:07.429 --> 02:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
to really maintain the privacy of the
 
02:57:10.469 --> 02:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
data and the security of the information
 
02:57:13.750 --> 02:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
so we have partnered with our our vendor
 
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
to have informed consent
 
02:57:18.950 --> 02:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
at the time of service so
 
02:57:21.190 --> 02:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
if someone shows up at
 
02:57:23.990 --> 02:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
the emergency department or at a food
 
02:57:26.790 --> 02:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
pantry and is seeking services there but
 
02:57:28.790 --> 02:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
then also needs additional services
 
02:57:30.710 --> 02:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere else they would be able to
 
02:57:32.870 --> 02:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
leverage the system to do
 
02:57:35.269 --> 02:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
a consent process to share on the
 
02:57:38.070 --> 02:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
platform as well as follow any
 
02:57:41.190 --> 02:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
required processes that they have for
 
02:57:42.790 --> 02:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
sharing that data
 
02:57:45.349 --> 02:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
to be specific
 
02:57:47.269 --> 02:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
the platform has an acknowledgement
 
02:57:49.510 --> 02:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
document or consent document that all
 
02:57:51.910 --> 02:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
clients will sign to support to support
 
02:57:53.349 --> 02:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
the sharing of information on the
 
02:57:53.359 --> 02:57:54.630 align:start position:0%
the sharing of information on the
platform

02:57:54.630 --> 02:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
platform
 
02:57:56.710 --> 02:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
it does describe what how their data
 
02:57:58.630 --> 02:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
would be shared across the platform and
 
02:58:00.630 --> 02:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
they would be shared within the network
 
02:58:03.429 --> 02:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
for services specifically being referred
 
02:58:05.670 --> 02:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
that they're being referred to
 
02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
it does not take the place of any
 
02:58:09.269 --> 02:58:09.279 align:start position:0%
provider specific consents
 
02:58:11.269 --> 02:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
authorizations or privacy notices that
 
02:58:13.429 --> 02:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
must be used by providers based on their
 
02:58:15.830 --> 02:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
specific privacy practices
 
02:58:17.750 --> 02:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
and in the case of
 
02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
commune mental health centers they have
 
02:58:21.830 --> 02:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
very strict process processes as it
 
02:58:24.870 --> 02:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
relates to 42 cfr part 2
 
02:58:26.950 --> 02:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
substance use data that they would still
 
02:58:28.950 --> 02:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
need to have their inform their consent
 
02:58:28.960 --> 02:58:30.950 align:start position:0%
need to have their inform their consent
documents

02:58:30.950 --> 02:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
documents
 
02:58:32.870 --> 02:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
also to share that information for
 
02:58:35.030 --> 02:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
referrals to other services
 
02:58:38.070 --> 02:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
so we definitely see this as a a primary
 
02:58:41.110 --> 02:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
part of that closed-loop referral system
 
02:58:43.830 --> 02:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
and it was already being established as
 
02:58:48.469 --> 02:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
as rules and policy for moving forward
 
02:58:50.389 --> 02:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
this this platform will allow for
 
02:58:53.510 --> 02:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
clients to seek services across um
 
02:58:56.710 --> 02:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
locations or services and it basically
 
02:59:00.469 --> 02:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
does address the ability to share data
 
02:59:03.429 --> 02:59:03.439 align:start position:0%
in a consolidated manner and to address
 
02:59:05.830 --> 02:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
one of the comments from representative
 
02:59:05.840 --> 02:59:06.870 align:start position:0%
one of the comments from representative
hammond

02:59:06.870 --> 02:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
hammond
 
02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
was that
 
02:59:10.150 --> 02:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
if we were using a paper process which
 
02:59:12.230 --> 02:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
we are currently today
 
02:59:15.030 --> 02:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
and sharing either via phone email or
 
02:59:17.590 --> 02:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
fax that data is shared in multiple
 
02:59:20.070 --> 02:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
locations it is not
 
02:59:22.550 --> 02:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
always consistent and it certainly isn't
 
02:59:24.790 --> 02:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner our goal is to use
 
02:59:26.230 --> 02:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
this platform
 
02:59:28.790 --> 02:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
to maintain consistency
 
02:59:30.230 --> 02:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
with the data
 
02:59:32.950 --> 02:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
as well as make sure that the data is
 
02:59:36.630 --> 02:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
accurate and is in a secure location
 
02:59:38.630 --> 02:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
in compliance with federal and state
 
02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:40.870 align:start position:0%
in compliance with federal and state
laws

02:59:40.870 --> 02:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
laws
 
02:59:42.630 --> 02:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
and i will defer
 
02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
over to jenny o'higgins for any specific
 
02:59:47.110 --> 02:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
examples that she wanted to bring up as
 
02:59:47.120 --> 02:59:49.429 align:start position:0%
examples that she wanted to bring up as
well

02:59:49.429 --> 02:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:52.309 --> 02:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
so hi there um thank you mr chair and
 
02:59:53.670 --> 02:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i'm jenny
 
02:59:55.910 --> 02:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
o'higgins i'm the legislative liaison
 
02:59:58.070 --> 02:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
and senior policy analyst for behavioral
 
03:00:01.110 --> 03:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
health at dhhs and my work is often
 
03:00:02.950 --> 03:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
focused in the substance use disorder
 
03:00:04.870 --> 03:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
system in new hampshire so i just wanted
 
03:00:07.269 --> 03:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
to briefly look at two specific examples
 
03:00:09.670 --> 03:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
of how this impacts a vulnerable person
 
03:00:10.950 --> 03:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
in the community
 
03:00:13.429 --> 03:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
so both our doorway system and our
 
03:00:16.389 --> 03:00:16.399 align:start position:0%
maternal opioid misuse model would be
 
03:00:19.510 --> 03:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
examples of programs that could utilize
 
03:00:21.990 --> 03:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
better care coordination and the ability
 
03:00:24.309 --> 03:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
to sort of close that loop so when i see
 
03:00:26.710 --> 03:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
a client being able to understand that
 
03:00:28.469 --> 03:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
they made it to the place that i
 
03:00:30.309 --> 03:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
referred them for the services that were
 
03:00:33.750 --> 03:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
needed and better monitoring outcomes
 
03:00:36.790 --> 03:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
are just those two programs as you know
 
03:00:38.870 --> 03:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
there are nine doorways across the state
 
03:00:40.870 --> 03:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
that act as access points offering a
 
03:00:42.389 --> 03:00:42.399 align:start position:0%
connection to substance use treatment
 
03:00:44.630 --> 03:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
and recovery services and people who
 
03:00:46.710 --> 03:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
access doorway services often have very
 
03:00:49.110 --> 03:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
complex needs the doorway may serve as
 
03:00:50.710 --> 03:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
an access point for substance use
 
03:00:52.469 --> 03:00:52.479 align:start position:0%
disorder treatment but to get there
 
03:00:54.230 --> 03:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
people need to be connected to housing
 
03:00:56.309 --> 03:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
and food security and job opportunities
 
03:00:58.469 --> 03:00:58.479 align:start position:0%
mental health services and other social
 
03:01:00.469 --> 03:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
supports and we know this to be true
 
03:01:02.710 --> 03:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
from our ongoing doorway work
 
03:01:04.630 --> 03:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
so in addition to the doorway program
 
03:01:06.550 --> 03:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has been awarded a federal
 
03:01:08.389 --> 03:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
medicaid funding under the maternal
 
03:01:10.870 --> 03:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
opioid misuse model and that model is
 
03:01:12.950 --> 03:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
really addressing fragmentation and care
 
03:01:14.950 --> 03:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
for pregnant and postpartum medicaid
 
03:01:17.429 --> 03:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries who are experiencing
 
03:01:19.269 --> 03:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
opioid use disorder
 
03:01:21.190 --> 03:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
the mom goals are to improve the quality
 
03:01:23.110 --> 03:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
of care and reduce the cost of providing
 
03:01:25.429 --> 03:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
care to mothers and infants
 
03:01:27.429 --> 03:01:27.439 align:start position:0%
it pays special attention to enhanced
 
03:01:29.269 --> 03:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
coordination of existing reproductive
 
03:01:31.990 --> 03:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
health maternity opioid use disorder and
 
03:01:34.389 --> 03:01:34.399 align:start position:0%
mental health care services so this bill
 
03:01:36.070 --> 03:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
would make the coordination of care for
 
03:01:38.469 --> 03:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
these moms and babies more challenging
 
03:01:40.550 --> 03:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
including our response to and treatment
 
03:01:42.790 --> 03:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
of neonatal abstinence syndrome
 
03:01:44.550 --> 03:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
the doorway program and the mom model
 
03:01:46.710 --> 03:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
were both an outgrowth of identified
 
03:01:48.870 --> 03:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
gaps in our systems and we really can't
 
03:01:50.389 --> 03:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
afford to move backwards or slow down
 
03:01:51.990 --> 03:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
our approach to addressing substance
 
03:01:53.750 --> 03:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
misuse in new hampshire
 
03:01:55.830 --> 03:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
so the good news is that people often go
 
03:01:57.030 --> 03:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
on to get well
 
03:01:58.790 --> 03:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
the reality is that people often have
 
03:02:00.230 --> 03:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
many barriers to achieving their
 
03:02:02.870 --> 03:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
recovery goals and people find recovery
 
03:02:05.269 --> 03:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
through many pathways but it's not often
 
03:02:06.630 --> 03:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
that they go on to get well on the
 
03:02:08.710 --> 03:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
street they need housing and it's not
 
03:02:10.150 --> 03:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
often that they go on to get well while
 
03:02:12.469 --> 03:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
experiencing food insecurity and so
 
03:02:14.150 --> 03:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
sharing this information across
 
03:02:15.750 --> 03:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
providers really allows for a
 
03:02:17.349 --> 03:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and a collaborative
 
03:02:19.670 --> 03:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
approach to a really complex issue and
 
03:02:21.750 --> 03:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
when we treat people in silos we
 
03:02:23.510 --> 03:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
continuously are left wondering why we
 
03:02:25.510 --> 03:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
don't see positive outcomes
 
03:02:27.190 --> 03:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
so in new hampshire we see that a
 
03:02:29.269 --> 03:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
majority of medicaid's highest need and
 
03:02:31.590 --> 03:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
highest cost beneficiaries really have
 
03:02:33.110 --> 03:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
multiple physical conditions
 
03:02:35.190 --> 03:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
co-occurring mental illness and or
 
03:02:37.349 --> 03:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and most of these
 
03:02:39.510 --> 03:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
individuals are in fragmented systems of
 
03:02:41.110 --> 03:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
care with little to no coordination
 
03:02:44.150 --> 03:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
across providers what we're trying to do
 
03:02:45.510 --> 03:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
is really to
 
03:02:47.429 --> 03:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
decrease those the
 
03:02:49.590 --> 03:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
poor quality and high costs and better
 
03:02:51.429 --> 03:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
coordinate their care for the population
 
03:02:53.030 --> 03:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
that has the potential to really improve
 
03:02:54.790 --> 03:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
their health outcomes and to control
 
03:02:54.800 --> 03:02:57.510 align:start position:0%
their health outcomes and to control
spending

03:02:57.510 --> 03:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
so i hope that was helpful and i think
 
03:03:01.030 --> 03:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
all three of us are here to answer any
 
03:03:02.870 --> 03:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
questions that we can the chair
 
03:03:05.429 --> 03:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative marsh with a
 
03:03:05.439 --> 03:03:06.630 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative marsh with a
question

03:03:06.630 --> 03:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:03:08.469 --> 03:03:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:03:10.790 --> 03:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i'm i'm not sure
 
03:03:12.950 --> 03:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
which of the members from the department
 
03:03:15.910 --> 03:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
this is best voice to and you can use
 
03:03:18.150 --> 03:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
choose for yourselves who's best
 
03:03:19.750 --> 03:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that there are
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
various procedures in place to prevent
 
03:03:24.389 --> 03:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
people from fraudulently accessing
 
03:03:28.070 --> 03:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
services or accessing duplicate services
 
03:03:30.469 --> 03:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
would this bill affect those systems
 
03:03:32.630 --> 03:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
that you currently have in place to
 
03:03:43.590 --> 03:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:45.670 --> 03:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
this is jonathan ballard david do you
 
03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
have information about the systems in
 
03:03:52.389 --> 03:03:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:55.030 --> 03:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
protections with verifying fraud and
 
03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:56.309 align:start position:0%
protections with verifying fraud and
waste

03:03:56.309 --> 03:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
waste
 
03:03:58.070 --> 03:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
abuse noise
 
03:04:00.309 --> 03:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
certainly this is david leaders
 
03:04:02.550 --> 03:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
information services director i
 
03:04:05.830 --> 03:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
we do have several systems in place for
 
03:04:08.870 --> 03:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
third party liability and fraud fraud
 
03:04:10.870 --> 03:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
provide waste and abuse
 
03:04:14.230 --> 03:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
this bill as it as it is right now
 
03:04:16.550 --> 03:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it would impact it
 
03:04:19.910 --> 03:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
directly however having the ability to
 
03:04:23.349 --> 03:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
share and have a platform in which to
 
03:04:26.550 --> 03:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
see the services that are being provided
 
03:04:28.469 --> 03:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
potentially would address that but that
 
03:04:30.230 --> 03:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
there was never the intent of this
 
03:04:32.790 --> 03:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
platform to be involved in the fraud
 
03:04:35.030 --> 03:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
waste and abuse component
 
03:04:37.910 --> 03:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
so that was not the goal the goal was to
 
03:04:39.910 --> 03:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
provide services and care coordination
 
03:04:42.309 --> 03:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
for our clients so i don't believe that
 
03:04:44.389 --> 03:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
this bill would impact that we would
 
03:04:46.150 --> 03:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
have to do further research on that
 
03:04:47.910 --> 03:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
03:04:52.070 --> 03:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee thank you
 
03:04:55.269 --> 03:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
03:04:57.910 --> 03:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you all
 
03:04:59.670 --> 03:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
all of the people who may be answering
 
03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:05:04.230 --> 03:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
um my question is outside of the
 
03:05:07.429 --> 03:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
platform that's being created now
 
03:05:10.710 --> 03:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
i know that i have many constituents who
 
03:05:10.720 --> 03:05:12.230 align:start position:0%
i know that i have many constituents who
interact

03:05:12.230 --> 03:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
interact
 
03:05:15.429 --> 03:05:15.439 align:start position:0%
for example with the one-stop
 
03:05:15.439 --> 03:05:17.030 align:start position:0%
for example with the one-stop
application

03:05:17.030 --> 03:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
application
 
03:05:19.830 --> 03:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
for various welfare
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
housing food benefits
 
03:05:25.349 --> 03:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
provided by the state across several
 
03:05:25.359 --> 03:05:26.870 align:start position:0%
provided by the state across several
programs

03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:05:28.950 --> 03:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering
 
03:05:30.870 --> 03:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
if you know
 
03:05:33.030 --> 03:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
how this bill is going to
 
03:05:33.040 --> 03:05:34.469 align:start position:0%
how this bill is going to
implicate

03:05:34.469 --> 03:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
implicate
 
03:05:34.479 --> 03:05:36.630 align:start position:0%
implicate
the

03:05:36.630 --> 03:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:05:39.750 --> 03:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
functioning of that system and all the
 
03:05:42.710 --> 03:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
other systems i know that ms o'higgins
 
03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
talked about the doorways program but
 
03:05:47.269 --> 03:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about other platforms that
 
03:05:50.389 --> 03:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
are designed to take away silos for
 
03:05:53.910 --> 03:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
people whose access to service is very
 
03:05:53.920 --> 03:05:55.510 align:start position:0%
people whose access to service is very
much

03:05:55.510 --> 03:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:05:57.269 --> 03:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
limited by their
 
03:05:59.990 --> 03:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
ability to access a computer access a
 
03:06:04.230 --> 03:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weber this is
 
03:06:08.950 --> 03:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:10.630 --> 03:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
the system you're referring to is called
 
03:06:13.030 --> 03:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire easy it's simply a website
 
03:06:15.910 --> 03:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
that connects individuals
 
03:06:17.429 --> 03:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
with the different services that they
 
03:06:19.269 --> 03:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
are eligible for
 
03:06:19.279 --> 03:06:20.150 align:start position:0%
are eligible for
the

03:06:20.150 --> 03:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:24.309 --> 03:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:24.319 --> 03:06:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
multiple

03:06:26.150 --> 03:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
03:06:28.870 --> 03:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
state agencies
 
03:06:30.550 --> 03:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
and so therefore it depends on how this
 
03:06:33.990 --> 03:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
bill is interpreted uh is dhhs the lone
 
03:06:38.710 --> 03:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
state agency or as divisions the agency
 
03:06:40.630 --> 03:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
david weeders has a lot of information
 
03:06:42.790 --> 03:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge around the behind the scenes
 
03:06:45.429 --> 03:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
mechanics of that website david can you
 
03:06:45.439 --> 03:06:48.710 align:start position:0%
mechanics of that website david can you
elaborate

03:06:48.710 --> 03:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:51.190 --> 03:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
sure so so that new hampshire easy
 
03:06:53.110 --> 03:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
system or the one stop application for
 
03:06:55.030 --> 03:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
housing food benefits and
 
03:06:57.110 --> 03:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid eligibility
 
03:06:59.349 --> 03:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
um shares information
 
03:07:01.349 --> 03:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
specifically internally
 
03:07:03.030 --> 03:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
so that we can see the eligibility but
 
03:07:05.269 --> 03:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
then once it gets internally it's shared
 
03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
externally with our housing providers
 
03:07:10.950 --> 03:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
and food pantry services so it certainly
 
03:07:13.110 --> 03:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
would indicate that we would have we
 
03:07:15.269 --> 03:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
would need to that is one of the many
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
systems that we would need to modify as
 
03:07:19.990 --> 03:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is written to
 
03:07:21.750 --> 03:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
inform the people
 
03:07:23.510 --> 03:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
that are applying for those services and
 
03:07:26.070 --> 03:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
benefits of their choices and so they
 
03:07:28.630 --> 03:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
would require us to update that system
 
03:07:30.630 --> 03:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
and how it communicates on the back end
 
03:07:33.030 --> 03:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
and then out to those provider services
 
03:07:34.950 --> 03:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
that is one of the larger systems that
 
03:07:37.670 --> 03:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
we would have modifications to
 
03:07:40.230 --> 03:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you that's very helpful
 
03:07:42.469 --> 03:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
03:07:42.479 --> 03:07:43.750 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
committee

03:07:43.750 --> 03:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:07:45.269 --> 03:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
03:07:48.150 --> 03:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative cushman thank you
 
03:07:49.750 --> 03:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:07:49.760 --> 03:07:50.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

03:07:50.790 --> 03:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:52.550 --> 03:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
so this is for
 
03:07:55.190 --> 03:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
either one of the information system
 
03:07:57.349 --> 03:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
um either the
 
03:07:59.510 --> 03:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
the liaison or the
 
03:08:01.670 --> 03:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
information system experts
 
03:08:04.309 --> 03:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
does the person seeking services
 
03:08:05.830 --> 03:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
currently know
 
03:08:07.750 --> 03:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
what information is being shared about
 
03:08:09.830 --> 03:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
them to other
 
03:08:18.230 --> 03:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:21.190 --> 03:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
so in the case of all of our systems
 
03:08:22.630 --> 03:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
03:08:24.230 --> 03:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
like the new hampshire easy that we were
 
03:08:26.230 --> 03:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
just referring to and
 
03:08:26.240 --> 03:08:27.349 align:start position:0%
just referring to and
um

03:08:27.349 --> 03:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
that system certainly shows the data
 
03:08:32.309 --> 03:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
that you're sharing upon an application
 
03:08:34.389 --> 03:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
and what that information will be shared
 
03:08:36.630 --> 03:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
in order to provide food
 
03:08:38.950 --> 03:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
housing and medicaid services
 
03:08:40.950 --> 03:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
in the case of the closed loop referral
 
03:08:40.960 --> 03:08:42.389 align:start position:0%
in the case of the closed loop referral
system

03:08:42.389 --> 03:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:08:44.550 --> 03:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
again there is a
 
03:08:46.630 --> 03:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's a either digital signature they
 
03:08:49.750 --> 03:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
could do it by phone or or they can they
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
they can do it in person without if they
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
can't sign themselves they would be able
 
03:08:56.070 --> 03:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
to see a copy of the document of what
 
03:08:58.550 --> 03:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
their what they're consenting to share
 
03:09:00.150 --> 03:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
and they would know the information that
 
03:09:02.950 --> 03:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
they were sharing on the platform itself
 
03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
and and where that refer where that
 
03:09:06.710 --> 03:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
information would be shared with in
 
03:09:10.230 --> 03:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:10.240 --> 03:09:11.429 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:09:11.429 --> 03:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:09:11.439 --> 03:09:12.870 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

03:09:12.870 --> 03:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:15.190 --> 03:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
so each time that their information is
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
accessed from a different organization
 
03:09:18.790 --> 03:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
do they get alerted that their
 
03:09:21.269 --> 03:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
information is being accessed
 
03:09:23.910 --> 03:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
and reviewed
 
03:09:25.510 --> 03:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:09:28.150 --> 03:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
and representative cushman
 
03:09:30.150 --> 03:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
they would not be alerted each time that
 
03:09:32.630 --> 03:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
they would be sharing information
 
03:09:34.870 --> 03:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
each time a provider accesses their
 
03:09:34.880 --> 03:09:35.990 align:start position:0%
each time a provider accesses their
information

03:09:35.990 --> 03:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:09:37.990 --> 03:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
they would be they would be alerted when
 
03:09:39.030 --> 03:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
they were
 
03:09:42.469 --> 03:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
initiating a referral so in the case of
 
03:09:45.030 --> 03:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
a person stopping in for
 
03:09:46.630 --> 03:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
housing supports
 
03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
getting a referral for food services
 
03:09:50.790 --> 03:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
they would be alerted at that time that
 
03:09:52.469 --> 03:09:52.479 align:start position:0%
they would have a referral for food
 
03:09:52.479 --> 03:09:53.910 align:start position:0%
they would have a referral for food
services

03:09:53.910 --> 03:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:09:56.870 --> 03:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
if there was an additional referral for
 
03:09:59.830 --> 03:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
sud services they would they would be
 
03:10:02.230 --> 03:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
notified by their case manager
 
03:10:03.750 --> 03:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
that they were getting a referral for
 
03:10:05.830 --> 03:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
those services as well
 
03:10:08.389 --> 03:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
so from that perspective they would be
 
03:10:10.469 --> 03:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
it's when that
 
03:10:13.349 --> 03:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
they would be notified upon referral not
 
03:10:16.389 --> 03:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:19.590 --> 03:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome representative gay
 
03:10:23.190 --> 03:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and um this is an i.t
 
03:10:25.510 --> 03:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
question uh but i guess all three of you
 
03:10:28.230 --> 03:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
would have an answer how is someone
 
03:10:31.830 --> 03:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
authorized to access a person or
 
03:10:33.750 --> 03:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
family's records
 
03:10:35.910 --> 03:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
i think if i were
 
03:10:38.150 --> 03:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
if my records were in there
 
03:10:40.070 --> 03:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
i would certainly know that people are
 
03:10:42.710 --> 03:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
going to help me need to see them
 
03:10:42.720 --> 03:10:43.429 align:start position:0%
going to help me need to see them
but

03:10:43.429 --> 03:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
my my personal concern is that if the
 
03:10:49.510 --> 03:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
database is just open and anybody can
 
03:10:51.269 --> 03:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
access anything
 
03:10:53.590 --> 03:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's a violation of privacy
 
03:10:55.750 --> 03:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
can you use keys
 
03:10:58.630 --> 03:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
so that the people who are authorized
 
03:11:03.510 --> 03:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:06.389 --> 03:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um and members of the
 
03:11:08.469 --> 03:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
committee that's a good question
 
03:11:10.630 --> 03:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
i would say right now
 
03:11:12.870 --> 03:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's very similar to the way you would
 
03:11:15.590 --> 03:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
sign a consent when you go to hospital
 
03:11:18.230 --> 03:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
to share your information with your
 
03:11:21.990 --> 03:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
family member on behalf of yourself
 
03:11:24.389 --> 03:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
once you sign that consent that person
 
03:11:26.630 --> 03:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
could request that information at any
 
03:11:26.640 --> 03:11:27.750 align:start position:0%
could request that information at any
time

03:11:27.750 --> 03:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:11:30.070 --> 03:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
it's the same with this where we we
 
03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
would have that consent at the initial
 
03:11:33.590 --> 03:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
to say we're sharing your information
 
03:11:35.670 --> 03:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
with these providers for these these
 
03:11:35.680 --> 03:11:36.870 align:start position:0%
with these providers for these these
services

03:11:36.870 --> 03:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:11:38.389 --> 03:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
and they would be able to request that
 
03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
information to be able to provide those
 
03:11:44.469 --> 03:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
services at any time
 
03:11:46.150 --> 03:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
03:11:47.670 --> 03:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
open access
 
03:11:47.680 --> 03:11:48.469 align:start position:0%
open access
to

03:11:48.469 --> 03:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:11:50.389 --> 03:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
a client's information
 
03:11:52.710 --> 03:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
that was not referred for services i
 
03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
will need to reach back out to make sure
 
03:11:57.030 --> 03:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
that this is addressed however i believe
 
03:11:59.110 --> 03:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
that it is not open unless you have an
 
03:12:02.550 --> 03:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
open referral for services
 
03:12:05.670 --> 03:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
one follow-up okay so if i understood
 
03:12:07.269 --> 03:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
you properly
 
03:12:09.349 --> 03:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
there is or will
 
03:12:10.870 --> 03:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
will be
 
03:12:14.710 --> 03:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
access authorized access required
 
03:12:16.950 --> 03:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
so that anybody's records cannot be
 
03:12:19.110 --> 03:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
accessed just by anybody who can reach
 
03:12:21.750 --> 03:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
the database it has to be
 
03:12:24.630 --> 03:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
you have and maybe it's multiple
 
03:12:26.630 --> 03:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
organizations but they have to be
 
03:12:26.640 --> 03:12:27.990 align:start position:0%
organizations but they have to be
authorized

03:12:27.990 --> 03:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
03:12:29.510 --> 03:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
to access
 
03:12:32.710 --> 03:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
that person or family's records that's a
 
03:12:32.720 --> 03:12:34.710 align:start position:0%
that person or family's records that's a
question

03:12:34.710 --> 03:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:12:36.950 --> 03:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:12:38.710 --> 03:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
i believe you are correct i will need to
 
03:12:41.750 --> 03:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
research and validate that 100
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
however the
 
03:12:43.439 --> 03:12:44.630 align:start position:0%
however the
the

03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:12:44.640 --> 03:12:46.550 align:start position:0%
the
the

03:12:46.550 --> 03:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:12:48.950 --> 03:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the cases of like for many of us i
 
03:12:50.790 --> 03:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
have i would have access to the system
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
but i would not have access to
 
03:12:53.910 --> 03:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
individual records
 
03:12:55.670 --> 03:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
i would only be able to look at the data
 
03:12:58.150 --> 03:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
in aggregate as representative hammond
 
03:13:00.790 --> 03:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
was referring to earlier to a question
 
03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
of how we would report data we would be
 
03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
looking at a high level we would not be
 
03:13:07.269 --> 03:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
able to see the individual record
 
03:13:09.269 --> 03:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
information because i do not need access
 
03:13:11.830 --> 03:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
to that so we use a policy of minimal
 
03:13:14.550 --> 03:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
use which is part of hipaa
 
03:13:16.150 --> 03:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
to ensure that
 
03:13:18.070 --> 03:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
if you don't need access to the data you
 
03:13:20.389 --> 03:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
should not have access to the data
 
03:13:23.030 --> 03:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
and so the care coordination
 
03:13:25.990 --> 03:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
team so if you're a case case manager in
 
03:13:28.229 --> 03:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
housing supports in your case manager
 
03:13:29.670 --> 03:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
and food services
 
03:13:31.750 --> 03:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
and you're a case manager in
 
03:13:33.510 --> 03:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
behavioral health services or mental
 
03:13:34.950 --> 03:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
health services
 
03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
and all three of those agencies are
 
03:13:39.269 --> 03:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
providing services to a single client
 
03:13:40.950 --> 03:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
all three of those agencies would have
 
03:13:42.389 --> 03:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
access to the data
 
03:13:42.399 --> 03:13:43.349 align:start position:0%
access to the data
however

03:13:43.349 --> 03:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:13:45.349 --> 03:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
if you're not providing access to that
 
03:13:47.990 --> 03:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
individual client and you are another
 
03:13:50.950 --> 03:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
food service or housing service
 
03:13:52.469 --> 03:13:52.479 align:start position:0%
you would not have access to that
 
03:13:54.309 --> 03:13:54.319 align:start position:0%
individual's data
 
03:13:57.349 --> 03:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cushman
 
03:14:00.150 --> 03:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh
 
03:14:01.830 --> 03:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
one final question could could the
 
03:14:05.590 --> 03:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
person seeking services be currently um
 
03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
as the system is without this bill being
 
03:14:09.910 --> 03:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
passed could they be turned down for
 
03:14:11.269 --> 03:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
services if they don't want their
 
03:14:16.070 --> 03:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:18.389 --> 03:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um the the
 
03:14:20.309 --> 03:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
answer there is absolutely not no they
 
03:14:22.630 --> 03:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
don't they do not need to participate in
 
03:14:24.229 --> 03:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
the platform in order to receive
 
03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
referrals however it would go to the
 
03:14:29.190 --> 03:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
secondary process of
 
03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
making referrals through the system so
 
03:14:34.229 --> 03:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
they would the individual case worker
 
03:14:35.830 --> 03:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
depending on which
 
03:14:37.510 --> 03:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
social services that they're working
 
03:14:37.520 --> 03:14:38.389 align:start position:0%
social services that they're working
with

03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:14:40.150 --> 03:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
they would have to take the name and
 
03:14:42.389 --> 03:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
information and still
 
03:14:44.950 --> 03:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
get a consent from that individual to
 
03:14:47.269 --> 03:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
then share the data either by fax or
 
03:14:49.349 --> 03:14:49.359 align:start position:0%
phone or email
 
03:14:51.429 --> 03:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
with the other agencies to provide those
 
03:14:51.439 --> 03:14:52.389 align:start position:0%
with the other agencies to provide those
services

03:14:52.389 --> 03:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:14:54.550 --> 03:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
so though the only difference is that it
 
03:14:56.870 --> 03:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
would not be on the platform and it
 
03:14:58.630 --> 03:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
would not be digitally transmitted so
 
03:15:00.469 --> 03:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
it'd be dependent upon the manual
 
03:15:02.309 --> 03:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
processes that are currently in place
 
03:15:02.319 --> 03:15:03.269 align:start position:0%
processes that are currently in place
today

03:15:03.269 --> 03:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:15:06.309 --> 03:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to resolve the um the
 
03:15:08.710 --> 03:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
time to delivery of those services with
 
03:15:12.950 --> 03:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:15.349 --> 03:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative kelsey you had your hand
 
03:15:15.359 --> 03:15:16.870 align:start position:0%
representative kelsey you had your hand
up

03:15:16.870 --> 03:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:15:18.950 --> 03:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
i did thank you mr chairman um
 
03:15:21.110 --> 03:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative cushman actually asked
 
03:15:23.590 --> 03:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
the question that i was going to ask so
 
03:15:24.870 --> 03:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:15:26.070 --> 03:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:15:28.870 --> 03:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
um would it this is chairman pearson
 
03:15:32.630 --> 03:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
would it make it more difficult
 
03:15:34.469 --> 03:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
to help people
 
03:15:36.710 --> 03:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
who seek our help
 
03:15:38.550 --> 03:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
if there was
 
03:15:40.070 --> 03:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
much less
 
03:15:40.080 --> 03:15:41.190 align:start position:0%
much less
data

03:15:41.190 --> 03:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
data
 
03:15:43.510 --> 03:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
in the system
 
03:15:45.429 --> 03:15:45.439 align:start position:0%
mr chairman this is jonathan ballard
 
03:15:49.429 --> 03:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
chief medical officer of dhhs i believe
 
03:15:49.439 --> 03:15:50.710 align:start position:0%
chief medical officer of dhhs i believe
absolutely

03:15:50.710 --> 03:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
03:15:53.510 --> 03:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
this bill if if passed even as amended
 
03:15:55.190 --> 03:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
would make it difficult
 
03:15:57.510 --> 03:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
for persons to receive help obviously
 
03:16:00.150 --> 03:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is not targeted towards
 
03:16:02.550 --> 03:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
the specific services that
 
03:16:04.950 --> 03:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh mr weeders is referring to for
 
03:16:07.110 --> 03:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
closed-loop referral services for
 
03:16:08.630 --> 03:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
individuals that need assistance from
 
03:16:11.349 --> 03:16:11.359 align:start position:0%
dhhs it's much broader it would affect
 
03:16:11.359 --> 03:16:12.389 align:start position:0%
dhhs it's much broader it would affect
everyone

03:16:12.389 --> 03:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
03:16:13.670 --> 03:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
and it would
 
03:16:13.680 --> 03:16:14.870 align:start position:0%
and it would
cause

03:16:14.870 --> 03:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
cause
 
03:16:17.110 --> 03:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
additional barriers to
 
03:16:19.190 --> 03:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
receiving help if a person were doing a
 
03:16:21.750 --> 03:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
telemedicine visit and needed services
 
03:16:23.510 --> 03:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
this bill obviously makes no provision
 
03:16:23.520 --> 03:16:25.910 align:start position:0%
this bill obviously makes no provision
for

03:16:25.910 --> 03:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:27.750 --> 03:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
that type of referral to happen without
 
03:16:30.070 --> 03:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
an in-person signature
 
03:16:32.389 --> 03:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
there there are many different
 
03:16:34.550 --> 03:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
facets that this bill would cause that
 
03:16:36.070 --> 03:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
would stop persons from receiving the
 
03:16:37.830 --> 03:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
help that they need throughout the
 
03:16:40.870 --> 03:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:16:45.910 --> 03:16:45.920 align:start position:0%

who wish to speak so i want to press on
 
03:16:54.389 --> 03:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
we will be taking a half an hour break
 
03:16:57.510 --> 03:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
when we finish this but i do not wish to
 
03:16:58.950 --> 03:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
continue it
 
03:17:01.269 --> 03:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
only for about a 20-minute continuance
 
03:17:02.710 --> 03:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
at another date
 
03:17:04.630 --> 03:17:04.640 align:start position:0%

member of the medical care advisory
 
03:17:31.429 --> 03:17:31.439 align:start position:0%

she does want you to know that the dhh
 
03:17:37.040 --> 03:17:38.150 align:start position:0%
she does want you to know that the dhh
contract

03:17:38.150 --> 03:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
contract
 
03:17:40.870 --> 03:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
that this is trying to amend and fix
 
03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
was put in place
 
03:17:44.950 --> 03:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
to add a closed-loop referral platform
 
03:17:46.469 --> 03:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:17:49.269 --> 03:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
using care monies or care act money
 
03:17:50.950 --> 03:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
and was passed without approval of the
 
03:17:50.960 --> 03:17:52.070 align:start position:0%
and was passed without approval of the
counselors

03:17:52.070 --> 03:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
counselors
 
03:17:54.309 --> 03:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
the contract was a sole source to a
 
03:17:56.950 --> 03:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
vendor which is not hipaa compliant
 
03:17:58.790 --> 03:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
and there are many closed loop referral
 
03:18:01.670 --> 03:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
platforms available many are hippo
 
03:18:03.830 --> 03:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
require compliant
 
03:18:06.150 --> 03:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
and that we need to understand that some
 
03:18:08.790 --> 03:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's mcos and larger
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
hospitals utilize their own hipaa
 
03:18:14.469 --> 03:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
compliant data sharing platforms already
 
03:18:16.389 --> 03:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
the move to create and endorse a system
 
03:18:18.150 --> 03:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
of non-medical providers to share new
 
03:18:20.790 --> 03:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire's citizens health information
 
03:18:23.349 --> 03:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
requires further study in her opinion by
 
03:18:24.950 --> 03:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
03:18:27.510 --> 03:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire currently does not define
 
03:18:30.710 --> 03:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
social service agency in law or rule
 
03:18:32.710 --> 03:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
and she asks that you carefully consider
 
03:18:35.429 --> 03:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
creating and defining social services
 
03:18:35.439 --> 03:18:36.469 align:start position:0%
creating and defining social services
agency

03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
agency
 
03:18:38.389 --> 03:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
without further delay
 
03:18:40.309 --> 03:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
the sponsors are likely referring to the
 
03:18:42.550 --> 03:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
information and referral systems service
 
03:18:44.630 --> 03:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
link and 2-1-1
 
03:18:46.070 --> 03:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
these systems are not health care
 
03:18:48.710 --> 03:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
providers or social service agencies
 
03:18:50.870 --> 03:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
they do not employ the trained staff
 
03:18:52.870 --> 03:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
which would rise to using the definition
 
03:18:54.389 --> 03:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
provided in the bill
 
03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
as filed or the amendment
 
03:18:58.630 --> 03:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
at the very least if those systems are
 
03:19:00.309 --> 03:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
to be transformed into actual health
 
03:19:02.389 --> 03:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
care delivery systems careful
 
03:19:04.229 --> 03:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
consideration should be given to the
 
03:19:06.389 --> 03:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
establishment of the same
 
03:19:08.150 --> 03:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
the bill turns them into something they
 
03:19:09.830 --> 03:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
are not without guidance for the
 
03:19:09.840 --> 03:19:11.349 align:start position:0%
are not without guidance for the
transformation

03:19:11.349 --> 03:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
transformation
 
03:19:13.349 --> 03:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
closed-loop referral systems begin with
 
03:19:15.429 --> 03:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
the management of physician practices
 
03:19:17.349 --> 03:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
and patient referrals to coordinate
 
03:19:18.870 --> 03:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
medical care
 
03:19:21.349 --> 03:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
this is outside the capacity of the
 
03:19:23.910 --> 03:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
current service link system
 
03:19:25.429 --> 03:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
carolyn would urge the committee to
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
leave health care delivery to qualified
 
03:19:27.279 --> 03:19:28.710 align:start position:0%
leave health care delivery to qualified

03:21:19.510 --> 03:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature should consider
 
03:21:22.150 --> 03:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
the value of information once collected
 
03:21:25.269 --> 03:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
how will it be or not be shared how long
 
03:21:27.269 --> 03:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
will information be stored
 
03:21:29.030 --> 03:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
and how can an individual revoke
 
03:21:30.790 --> 03:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
permission for sharing
 
03:21:33.030 --> 03:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
can the information be sold how costly
 
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
will a system be
 
03:21:36.550 --> 03:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
once the current money is not available
 
03:21:39.670 --> 03:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
to fund it she wishes to point out that
 
03:21:41.590 --> 03:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
right now the care money
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
would would provide the the the money to
 
03:21:45.510 --> 03:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
to make this happen
 
03:21:47.190 --> 03:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
but what happens when there is no care
 
03:21:47.200 --> 03:21:48.229 align:start position:0%
but what happens when there is no care
money

03:21:48.229 --> 03:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:21:50.389 --> 03:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
she thanks you for your consideration
 
03:21:52.229 --> 03:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
and i can answer any questions that i
 
03:21:54.389 --> 03:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
can but she will be available and more
 
03:21:56.710 --> 03:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
than happy to speak to anyone who would
 
03:21:58.389 --> 03:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
like to understand and i hope that most
 
03:22:01.750 --> 03:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
of you know carolyn has been 40 years
 
03:22:04.550 --> 03:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
helping the elderly who are
 
03:22:06.309 --> 03:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
who stay at home rather than in nursing
 
03:22:08.790 --> 03:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
homes so she's well aware and well
 
03:22:10.229 --> 03:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
versed in
 
03:22:12.229 --> 03:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
how dangerous this this system could be
 
03:22:13.269 --> 03:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
to them
 
03:22:15.349 --> 03:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you senator clegg

[Music]
 
03:22:30.790 --> 03:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
i really have a question because i'm
 
03:22:32.309 --> 03:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
really lost
 
03:22:34.469 --> 03:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
this bill was
 
03:22:37.830 --> 03:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
as i understand it the attempt was to
 
03:22:40.550 --> 03:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
give people an option to restrict how
 
03:22:42.630 --> 03:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
far their personal information would be
 
03:22:42.640 --> 03:22:44.150 align:start position:0%
far their personal information would be
disseminated

03:22:44.150 --> 03:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
disseminated
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
by using a common database
 
03:22:50.469 --> 03:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
from what you're saying it sounds like
 
03:22:53.670 --> 03:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
you're addressing the whole issue of
 
03:22:56.309 --> 03:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
whether we should have
 
03:22:58.950 --> 03:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
a closed system which i assume is a
 
03:22:58.960 --> 03:23:00.550 align:start position:0%
a closed system which i assume is a
database

03:23:00.550 --> 03:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
database
 
03:23:00.560 --> 03:23:03.190 align:start position:0%
database
um

03:23:03.190 --> 03:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:05.349 --> 03:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
is that is that right that you're
 
03:23:07.349 --> 03:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
talking about we should not
 
03:23:09.590 --> 03:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
right now without knowing more we
 
03:23:13.269 --> 03:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be adopting a closed system
 
03:23:16.229 --> 03:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
whereas i'm coming in here not knowing
 
03:23:18.790 --> 03:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
not thinking i'm agreeing to it i'm
 
03:23:21.910 --> 03:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
trying to restrict access to it
 
03:23:21.920 --> 03:23:22.870 align:start position:0%
trying to restrict access to it
are

03:23:22.870 --> 03:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:23:27.030 --> 03:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
trying to restrict how the data gets out
 
03:23:29.510 --> 03:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
am i am i lost here
 
03:23:31.030 --> 03:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gate no you're
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
not lost representative ammon saw a
 
03:23:36.150 --> 03:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
system that suddenly showed up
 
03:23:38.630 --> 03:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
that had no privacy protection
 
03:23:39.750 --> 03:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
and he did
 
03:23:41.349 --> 03:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
the right thing in the sense that he
 
03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
went out and said let me see if i can
 
03:23:44.790 --> 03:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
protect the privacy
 
03:23:46.710 --> 03:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
we're hitting it from the fact that
 
03:23:48.550 --> 03:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
we've adopted something or we have
 
03:23:50.950 --> 03:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
something in the state of new hampshire
 
03:23:52.950 --> 03:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
that nobody knew about somebody walked
 
03:23:54.550 --> 03:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
in and said hey i think this is a good
 
03:23:54.560 --> 03:23:55.670 align:start position:0%
in and said hey i think this is a good
idea

03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
idea
 
03:23:57.670 --> 03:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
and under the current system
 
03:24:00.710 --> 03:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
the governor said yeah okay let's do it
 
03:24:02.790 --> 03:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
it hasn't come before any legislative
 
03:24:05.269 --> 03:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
body yet to see whether or not it's good
 
03:24:07.750 --> 03:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
and as i understood it from
 
03:24:07.760 --> 03:24:08.469 align:start position:0%
and as i understood it from
the

03:24:08.469 --> 03:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:24:09.990 --> 03:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
previous speakers from the department of
 
03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
health and human services it obviously
 
03:24:15.110 --> 03:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
didn't have their input before it was
 
03:24:17.429 --> 03:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
started because typically
 
03:24:18.550 --> 03:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
some of the things that they were
 
03:24:20.469 --> 03:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
talking about would have been corrected
 
03:24:22.550 --> 03:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
before it ever hit your desks
 
03:24:24.870 --> 03:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
so we're hitting it from the fact that
 
03:24:26.630 --> 03:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
while i i think what representative
 
03:24:28.630 --> 03:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
ammon did is a lot of well i think he
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
did a great job
 
03:24:32.309 --> 03:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
he's trying to fix something
 
03:24:34.389 --> 03:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
that is so broken i'm not sure it should
 
03:24:38.630 --> 03:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:40.469 --> 03:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:24:44.469 --> 03:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:46.870 --> 03:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
 
03:24:46.880 --> 03:24:47.670 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
and

03:24:47.670 --> 03:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:24:50.070 --> 03:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
we uh i did not get this notice until
 
03:24:53.190 --> 03:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
just now but uh senator uh sorry about
 
03:24:56.469 --> 03:24:56.479 align:start position:0%

03:24:56.479 --> 03:24:58.070 align:start position:0%
that representative jess edwards
um

03:24:58.070 --> 03:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
was in the queue so senator golly am i
 
03:25:03.830 --> 03:25:03.840 align:start position:0%

this is representative jess edwards
representing

03:25:12.070 --> 03:25:12.080 align:start position:0%

03:25:30.950 --> 03:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
on two long naming committees but um
 
03:25:34.070 --> 03:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
i i i think we did some really good work
 
03:25:36.309 --> 03:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
there under the leadership of senator
 
03:25:39.510 --> 03:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
khan we recognized that
 
03:25:41.990 --> 03:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
that there's this tremendous opportunity
 
03:25:44.790 --> 03:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
to manage community care
 
03:25:47.309 --> 03:25:47.319 align:start position:0%
through the state and we saw that
 
03:25:49.990 --> 03:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists were precluded by federal
 
03:25:52.469 --> 03:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
law or excuse me state law in a way that
 
03:25:54.630 --> 03:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
was too restrictive relative to federal
 
03:25:54.640 --> 03:25:55.750 align:start position:0%
was too restrictive relative to federal
law

03:25:55.750 --> 03:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:25:57.510 --> 03:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
so that psychiatrists couldn't really
 
03:26:00.150 --> 03:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
participate as full members of this core
 
03:26:02.630 --> 03:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
this care community coordination
 
03:26:05.429 --> 03:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
community so we submitted a bill to
 
03:26:07.429 --> 03:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
change ad i think that bill passed i
 
03:26:09.750 --> 03:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
lost track of it but so i'm coming at
 
03:26:11.750 --> 03:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
this letting you know i respect the need
 
03:26:14.229 --> 03:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
and the value of coordinated care
 
03:26:16.469 --> 03:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
but one of the things i i think we've
 
03:26:18.469 --> 03:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
picked up on on several
 
03:26:19.990 --> 03:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
of these kind of bills over the last
 
03:26:21.349 --> 03:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
couple years
 
03:26:22.950 --> 03:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:26:26.070 --> 03:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough respect
 
03:26:26.080 --> 03:26:26.950 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough respect
for

03:26:26.950 --> 03:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:26:29.269 --> 03:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
the privacy rights of our individual
 
03:26:29.279 --> 03:26:30.630 align:start position:0%
the privacy rights of our individual
citizens

03:26:30.630 --> 03:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
03:26:33.190 --> 03:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
and we end up getting these communities
 
03:26:33.200 --> 03:26:34.630 align:start position:0%
and we end up getting these communities
uh

03:26:34.630 --> 03:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:26:37.590 --> 03:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
entities together that say it would be
 
03:26:39.910 --> 03:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
easier it would be better if we could
 
03:26:41.349 --> 03:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
03:26:43.990 --> 03:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
take this information and use it to help
 
03:26:45.269 --> 03:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
our patients
 
03:26:47.269 --> 03:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
and they do that from a goodness of
 
03:26:49.269 --> 03:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
their heart and a dedication to their
 
03:26:49.279 --> 03:26:50.229 align:start position:0%
their heart and a dedication to their
mission

03:26:50.229 --> 03:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
mission
 
03:26:53.670 --> 03:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
but the patients the individual patients
 
03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
who own their own
 
03:26:59.590 --> 03:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
data are not usually at the table
 
03:27:02.630 --> 03:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
so so i come at this and generally in
 
03:27:06.150 --> 03:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
support of 601 i don't like the the fact
 
03:27:07.910 --> 03:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
that the form got put in there i think
 
03:27:10.389 --> 03:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
representative merchant talked to that i
 
03:27:12.389 --> 03:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
think it's a mistake to put
 
03:27:15.429 --> 03:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
forms into legislation um that's a good
 
03:27:18.710 --> 03:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
jail car activity but even more to
 
03:27:21.910 --> 03:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
represent shapiro's earlier point
 
03:27:24.389 --> 03:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
the intent i think of 601 is to be
 
03:27:28.070 --> 03:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
consistent with hipaa
 
03:27:29.910 --> 03:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think we should be making
 
03:27:32.389 --> 03:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
redundant documentation for health care
 
03:27:32.399 --> 03:27:33.830 align:start position:0%
redundant documentation for health care
providers

03:27:33.830 --> 03:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
providers
 
03:27:35.190 --> 03:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
to the extent
 
03:27:35.200 --> 03:27:37.030 align:start position:0%
to the extent
that

03:27:37.030 --> 03:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:27:37.040 --> 03:27:38.229 align:start position:0%
that
opt-in

03:27:38.229 --> 03:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
opt-in
 
03:27:41.030 --> 03:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
would be required i think it should just
 
03:27:44.790 --> 03:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
become integrated in all the hipaa forms
 
03:27:46.229 --> 03:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
03:27:48.150 --> 03:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
and the way to do that is not to put it
 
03:27:51.190 --> 03:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
in this legislation but to to
 
03:27:52.950 --> 03:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
to write the legislation in a way in
 
03:27:52.960 --> 03:27:53.910 align:start position:0%
to write the legislation in a way in
which

03:27:53.910 --> 03:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:27:57.190 --> 03:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature reaffirms its um
 
03:27:59.990 --> 03:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
commitment to our newest
 
03:28:02.309 --> 03:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to protect
 
03:28:02.319 --> 03:28:03.590 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to protect
privacy

03:28:03.590 --> 03:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
03:28:06.790 --> 03:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
and uh to make sure that the entities
 
03:28:08.309 --> 03:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
that work for us while they're trying to
 
03:28:11.190 --> 03:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
do great work for our citizens but they
 
03:28:14.389 --> 03:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
also do it fully respectful of the fact
 
03:28:16.710 --> 03:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
that citizens own their data and it
 
03:28:20.150 --> 03:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
isn't the property of the state until
 
03:28:23.750 --> 03:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
the citizen actively agrees to give them
 
03:28:24.870 --> 03:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
their data
 
03:28:27.590 --> 03:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
so um so that so that's really the end
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
of my uh testimony thank you for
 
03:28:31.830 --> 03:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak mr chair would you
 
03:28:34.229 --> 03:28:34.239 align:start position:0%

03:28:34.239 --> 03:28:35.190 align:start position:0%

03:28:39.830 --> 03:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:41.429 --> 03:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
would you take any questions
 
03:28:43.670 --> 03:28:43.680 align:start position:0%

03:28:47.110 --> 03:28:47.120 align:start position:0%

03:28:48.550 --> 03:28:48.560 align:start position:0%

03:28:51.429 --> 03:28:51.439 align:start position:0%

representative gay is wishing to ask
the

03:28:58.070 --> 03:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:29:00.150 --> 03:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
future senator a question
 
03:29:02.309 --> 03:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for not hitting me
 
03:29:04.950 --> 03:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative edwards
 
03:29:07.349 --> 03:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
i you know i'm in full agreement with
 
03:29:11.429 --> 03:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
you so what is your recommendation about
 
03:29:14.870 --> 03:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
601 since we're we're offered what we're
 
03:29:17.269 --> 03:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
offered is this going to
 
03:29:17.279 --> 03:29:18.309 align:start position:0%
offered is this going to
help

03:29:18.309 --> 03:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:29:20.630 --> 03:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh if we took the form out
 
03:29:20.640 --> 03:29:21.670 align:start position:0%
uh if we took the form out
um

03:29:21.670 --> 03:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:23.190 --> 03:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
because that will
 
03:29:26.229 --> 03:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
you know hopefully the wording either is
 
03:29:29.910 --> 03:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
or can be made more in line to support
 
03:29:31.110 --> 03:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
hipaa for
 
03:29:32.870 --> 03:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
all these social
 
03:29:34.950 --> 03:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
social needs
 
03:29:36.710 --> 03:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
what do you recommend
 
03:29:39.110 --> 03:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
what do i recommend uh i would never
 
03:29:41.110 --> 03:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
step on the
 
03:29:43.269 --> 03:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
chairman's toes and i don't know how
 
03:29:44.630 --> 03:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
busy you are
 
03:29:47.429 --> 03:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
i i don't think this the bill is well
 
03:29:49.510 --> 03:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
intentioned and as much as i support it
 
03:29:50.950 --> 03:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think the way it's written it's
 
03:29:53.429 --> 03:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
ready to pass in its current state so
 
03:29:55.110 --> 03:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
what does that mean to the committee
 
03:29:56.710 --> 03:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
does this mean you want to retain it do
 
03:29:58.950 --> 03:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
you want to work on it do you want to
 
03:30:01.349 --> 03:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know it feels to me after two or
 
03:30:03.830 --> 03:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
three terms of hearing about privacy
 
03:30:03.840 --> 03:30:04.710 align:start position:0%
three terms of hearing about privacy
issues

03:30:04.710 --> 03:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:30:06.950 --> 03:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
it may be a good time for us to take a
 
03:30:09.670 --> 03:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
study committee that just solely and
 
03:30:13.510 --> 03:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
only looks at the extent to which um our
 
03:30:16.550 --> 03:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
health care system is working in in in
 
03:30:19.510 --> 03:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
collaborative ways to uh protect the
 
03:30:21.510 --> 03:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
right of privacy of patients and the
 
03:30:24.950 --> 03:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
right to consent and the right to to uh
 
03:30:27.990 --> 03:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
share that consent amongst the community
 
03:30:30.550 --> 03:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
of providers i if this if this became a
 
03:30:33.590 --> 03:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
study committee that only looked at
 
03:30:36.550 --> 03:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
systemically what are we doing overall
 
03:30:38.870 --> 03:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
to protect patient privacy that that may
 
03:30:41.510 --> 03:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
not be the worst idea i've had this week
 
03:30:44.070 --> 03:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for observing
 
03:30:46.309 --> 03:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
my where my feet are they're about 30
 
03:30:48.469 --> 03:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
miles away from you but thank you
 
03:30:50.469 --> 03:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh what you just said sounds like a
 
03:30:52.070 --> 03:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing that you could work on
 
03:30:53.750 --> 03:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
over the summer and file this
 
03:30:56.070 --> 03:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
legislation in the fall and i've already
 
03:30:59.830 --> 03:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
said to um representative ammon that
 
03:31:01.750 --> 03:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
we're really jammed up here and study
 
03:31:01.760 --> 03:31:03.269 align:start position:0%
we're really jammed up here and study
committees

03:31:03.269 --> 03:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
committees
 
03:31:06.389 --> 03:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
to make a bill better
 
03:31:07.990 --> 03:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
we're not going to use a lot of them
 
03:31:10.710 --> 03:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
however i also told them that while
 
03:31:12.790 --> 03:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
we're having a big exec session next
 
03:31:15.190 --> 03:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
week i would be happy to wait an extra
 
03:31:19.110 --> 03:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
week should an amendment be suggested to
 
03:31:19.120 --> 03:31:19.990 align:start position:0%
week should an amendment be suggested to
him

03:31:19.990 --> 03:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
him
 
03:31:23.190 --> 03:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
so with that uh let's see no hands are
 
03:31:26.950 --> 03:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
up thank you representative edwards
 
03:31:29.910 --> 03:31:29.920 align:start position:0%

03:31:32.950 --> 03:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
predecessor as the custodian of bad
 
03:31:35.429 --> 03:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
jokes and awful puns in the house
 
03:31:37.510 --> 03:31:37.520 align:start position:0%

03:31:54.070 --> 03:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record i'm neil
 
03:31:56.870 --> 03:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
kirk i live in where and i support this
 
03:31:58.389 --> 03:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
bill however
 
03:32:01.429 --> 03:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
after hearing the testimony from
 
03:32:03.190 --> 03:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
former senator clegg
 
03:32:06.469 --> 03:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
and the testimony from
 
03:32:09.670 --> 03:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
the folks at health and human services
 
03:32:11.830 --> 03:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
i think this bill is not ready for prime
 
03:32:13.269 --> 03:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
time however
 
03:32:15.670 --> 03:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
simply itlling it or turning it into a
 
03:32:17.429 --> 03:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
study committee is not going to solve
 
03:32:19.269 --> 03:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
the problem that we're currently faced
 
03:32:19.279 --> 03:32:20.229 align:start position:0%
the problem that we're currently faced
with

03:32:20.229 --> 03:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:32:22.309 --> 03:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
therefore this is my conclusion i'll
 
03:32:24.070 --> 03:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
support it later
 
03:32:25.830 --> 03:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
therefore i think we need to have a
 
03:32:25.840 --> 03:32:27.269 align:start position:0%
therefore i think we need to have a
moratorium

03:32:27.269 --> 03:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
moratorium
 
03:32:30.389 --> 03:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
on this particular
 
03:32:32.070 --> 03:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
closed-loop system
 
03:32:33.910 --> 03:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
which was funded by the cares act
 
03:32:36.389 --> 03:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
through the executive council and is
 
03:32:39.590 --> 03:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
with a company or an organization called
 
03:32:42.309 --> 03:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
unite space us
 
03:32:44.070 --> 03:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's the organization
 
03:32:45.349 --> 03:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
that the
 
03:32:47.590 --> 03:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
department is contracted with to provide
 
03:32:49.750 --> 03:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
this system
 
03:32:51.830 --> 03:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
if there's a moratorium on that we will
 
03:32:53.750 --> 03:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
have time to
 
03:32:55.750 --> 03:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
do the right thing
 
03:32:58.309 --> 03:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
with respect to privacy and that is
 
03:33:00.870 --> 03:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
focus not as broadly as apparently this
 
03:33:02.950 --> 03:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
bill does but focus on that particular
 
03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
system um
 
03:33:07.670 --> 03:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
here's the situation we're currently
 
03:33:08.950 --> 03:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
faced with
 
03:33:10.469 --> 03:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
we've just passed a constitutional
 
03:33:12.389 --> 03:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
amendment on privacy
 
03:33:14.469 --> 03:33:14.479 align:start position:0%
and this is the first time that i'm
 
03:33:17.429 --> 03:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
aware of that a new
 
03:33:19.670 --> 03:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
database is being created
 
03:33:21.349 --> 03:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
the pdmp
 
03:33:21.359 --> 03:33:22.710 align:start position:0%
the pdmp
and

03:33:22.710 --> 03:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:24.950 --> 03:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
the vaccine databases were created years
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
ago before the privacy amendment this is
 
03:33:28.229 --> 03:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
the first one that's being created
 
03:33:30.150 --> 03:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
afterwards and as senator clegg
 
03:33:32.229 --> 03:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned there is no legislative
 
03:33:34.309 --> 03:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
authorization for this
 
03:33:37.670 --> 03:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
it simply went through the covet process
 
03:33:39.910 --> 03:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
so the legislature i need i think needs
 
03:33:42.150 --> 03:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
to take back ownership of this put in a
 
03:33:44.469 --> 03:33:44.479 align:start position:0%
moratorium to give it an opportunity to
 
03:33:45.990 --> 03:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
determine what kinds of privacy
 
03:33:48.150 --> 03:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
protections should go with this new
 
03:33:49.830 --> 03:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
system consistent with the
 
03:33:53.269 --> 03:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:53.279 --> 03:33:54.389 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

03:33:54.389 --> 03:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:33:54.399 --> 03:33:55.510 align:start position:0%
amendment
now

03:33:55.510 --> 03:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:33:57.190 --> 03:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
there are two kinds of people seeking
 
03:33:58.950 --> 03:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
services in this system people for whom
 
03:34:01.429 --> 03:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
the state is paying like on medicaid and
 
03:34:04.389 --> 03:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
the entire self-pay self-insured private
 
03:34:06.950 --> 03:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
pay group they're all included under
 
03:34:10.070 --> 03:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
this bill excuse me under this system
 
03:34:12.550 --> 03:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
and the state seems to be expanding its
 
03:34:14.389 --> 03:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
interest in collecting information not
 
03:34:16.229 --> 03:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
just on the medicaid people and other
 
03:34:18.070 --> 03:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
people for which it pays
 
03:34:20.550 --> 03:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
for everybody else in the in the state
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
who are paying their own way or are
 
03:34:24.870 --> 03:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
having private insurance pay their way
 
03:34:27.510 --> 03:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's an extraordinary expansion
 
03:34:27.520 --> 03:34:28.389 align:start position:0%
that's an extraordinary expansion
of

03:34:28.389 --> 03:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:34:30.389 --> 03:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
activity on the part of the department
 
03:34:34.229 --> 03:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:36.550 --> 03:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
the key thing about that this bill is
 
03:34:38.550 --> 03:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
trying to address and it was i think
 
03:34:41.590 --> 03:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
intended only for the unite us system
 
03:34:44.469 --> 03:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
not for 911
 
03:34:45.590 --> 03:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
not for
 
03:34:47.429 --> 03:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
any of the other systems that the state
 
03:34:48.710 --> 03:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
may have
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
was to make sure that the consent was
 
03:34:51.840 --> 03:34:53.590 align:start position:0%
was to make sure that the consent was
real

03:34:53.590 --> 03:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
real
 
03:34:56.150 --> 03:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
that it was in very clear language what
 
03:34:57.590 --> 03:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
you were consenting to and what the
 
03:35:00.229 --> 03:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
consequences were and it was also very
 
03:35:02.309 --> 03:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
clear this is the second thing that
 
03:35:04.550 --> 03:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
informed consent not only means that you
 
03:35:06.229 --> 03:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
give your consent
 
03:35:08.710 --> 03:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
but that if you don't give your consent
 
03:35:11.110 --> 03:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
you are not subjected to penalty that is
 
03:35:13.349 --> 03:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
a denial of services or some other
 
03:35:16.309 --> 03:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
penalty without both of those two things
 
03:35:18.469 --> 03:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
you don't have i think you would have in
 
03:35:19.990 --> 03:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
this case a clear violation of the
 
03:35:20.000 --> 03:35:22.830 align:start position:0%
this case a clear violation of the
constitution

03:35:22.830 --> 03:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:26.150 --> 03:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
um the reason for putting a number of
 
03:35:27.830 --> 03:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
you have raised this question the reason
 
03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
for putting the specific
 
03:35:29.760 --> 03:35:30.710 align:start position:0%
for putting the specific
um

03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:33.590 --> 03:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
nature of the consent form into statute
 
03:35:35.750 --> 03:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
was that when the legislature has not
 
03:35:37.590 --> 03:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
done this as in the case of the vaccine
 
03:35:40.150 --> 03:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
registry in the case of pdmp
 
03:35:42.790 --> 03:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
the kinds of consent forms that the
 
03:35:45.110 --> 03:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
department comes up with and that are
 
03:35:47.190 --> 03:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
indeed approved by gelcar
 
03:35:50.630 --> 03:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
don't really reflect legislative intent
 
03:35:52.309 --> 03:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
and don't meet the two criteria that
 
03:35:54.469 --> 03:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
i've just indicated
 
03:35:56.469 --> 03:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
fully informed consent and
 
03:35:58.070 --> 03:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement to the individual that
 
03:35:59.910 --> 03:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
if you don't give us consent you can
 
03:36:01.990 --> 03:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
still get the service if you don't have
 
03:36:02.000 --> 03:36:02.950 align:start position:0%
still get the service if you don't have
that

03:36:02.950 --> 03:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:36:05.190 --> 03:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
what do you have indeed i checked in
 
03:36:07.590 --> 03:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
north carolina where unite us is already
 
03:36:09.670 --> 03:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
in play and they have consent forms out
 
03:36:11.510 --> 03:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
there and i believe you should have
 
03:36:13.750 --> 03:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
received by email a copy of the north
 
03:36:15.590 --> 03:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
carolina consent form
 
03:36:17.830 --> 03:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's very clear or it's not very clear
 
03:36:20.469 --> 03:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
what you're consenting to and it's also
 
03:36:22.229 --> 03:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
very unclear what happens if you don't
 
03:36:23.670 --> 03:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
give your consent
 
03:36:25.830 --> 03:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
that to me is exactly what we don't want
 
03:36:28.150 --> 03:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
to happen in new hampshire
 
03:36:29.750 --> 03:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
there is a reference in that consent
 
03:36:32.070 --> 03:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
form to the privacy policy but that's
 
03:36:34.630 --> 03:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
four pages of dense legalese and of
 
03:36:36.070 --> 03:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
course we all know that no one reads
 
03:36:36.080 --> 03:36:37.110 align:start position:0%
course we all know that no one reads
that

03:36:37.110 --> 03:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:36:37.120 --> 03:36:39.429 align:start position:0%
that
so

03:36:39.429 --> 03:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:41.510 --> 03:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
in summation um
 
03:36:43.750 --> 03:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
the bill as presented to you including
 
03:36:44.950 --> 03:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
03:36:46.870 --> 03:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh does not deal with all of the issues
 
03:36:48.389 --> 03:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
that have been raised by people who
 
03:36:50.389 --> 03:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
opposed to it and even though i support
 
03:36:52.630 --> 03:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
the concept as representative edwards
 
03:36:52.640 --> 03:36:53.510 align:start position:0%
the concept as representative edwards
does

03:36:53.510 --> 03:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:36:56.070 --> 03:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
um the bill is not i think ready for
 
03:36:57.349 --> 03:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
prime time
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
if you do not put in a moratorium if you
 
03:37:01.750 --> 03:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
simply retain it
 
03:37:03.670 --> 03:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
the system will go ahead the department
 
03:37:05.590 --> 03:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
will go through the rule making process
 
03:37:07.590 --> 03:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
and so forth and the legislature will
 
03:37:10.309 --> 03:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
have no input into the system and when
 
03:37:12.229 --> 03:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
in fact the retained bill
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
is brought forward next year the system
 
03:37:16.309 --> 03:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
will be in play and as representative
 
03:37:17.910 --> 03:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
ammon said the horse will be out of the
 
03:37:17.920 --> 03:37:18.870 align:start position:0%
ammon said the horse will be out of the
barn

03:37:18.870 --> 03:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
barn
 
03:37:21.990 --> 03:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
so my request to you is that you
 
03:37:23.910 --> 03:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
or that representative ammon rewrite
 
03:37:26.389 --> 03:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
this in a way that there is a moratorium
 
03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
and that um
 
03:37:31.269 --> 03:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
the uh committee will act on this or
 
03:37:33.429 --> 03:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
other legislation will be placed
 
03:37:36.309 --> 03:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
into into the hopper for next year thank

not seeing her in the list
 
03:39:01.269 --> 03:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
our list is alphabetized by first name
 
03:39:03.110 --> 03:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
which is not always helpful but that's
 
03:39:03.120 --> 03:39:03.990 align:start position:0%
which is not always helpful but that's
okay

03:39:03.990 --> 03:39:04.000 align:start position:0%

she was she's the third one on the list
 
03:39:34.870 --> 03:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
hi uh good morning okay yep it just it
 
03:39:36.469 --> 03:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
just came up to the top i had her
 
03:39:38.950 --> 03:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
without her hand up
 
03:39:40.950 --> 03:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
and she is now
 
03:39:42.870 --> 03:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
permitted which makes me think that
 
03:39:42.880 --> 03:39:43.750 align:start position:0%
permitted which makes me think that
maybe

03:39:43.750 --> 03:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:39:47.429 --> 03:39:47.439 align:start position:0%
uh christina is back but anyway go ahead
 
03:39:48.790 --> 03:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
03:39:50.870 --> 03:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is aaron gray and
 
03:39:53.349 --> 03:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
my company aunt bertha runs findhelp.org
 
03:39:55.110 --> 03:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
the largest referral network for social
 
03:39:57.429 --> 03:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
services in the united states we are a
 
03:39:59.030 --> 03:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
public benefit corporation based in
 
03:40:01.110 --> 03:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
austin texas and we have earned the
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
trust of more than 300 customers
 
03:40:04.229 --> 03:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
including the states of florida south
 
03:40:06.469 --> 03:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
carolina pennsylvania and more than 200
 
03:40:08.229 --> 03:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
health care organizations including many
 
03:40:10.070 --> 03:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
that do business in new hampshire
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
when we learned that the state of new
 
03:40:13.030 --> 03:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire was interested in implementing
 
03:40:14.550 --> 03:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
a statewide referral network we were
 
03:40:16.469 --> 03:40:16.479 align:start position:0%
obviously delighted we met with the
 
03:40:17.910 --> 03:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
state but they decided to move in a
 
03:40:19.269 --> 03:40:19.279 align:start position:0%
different direction because our solution
 
03:40:21.510 --> 03:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
did not meet their specifications
 
03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not here today to complain about
 
03:40:24.469 --> 03:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
that decision or ask you to somehow
 
03:40:26.469 --> 03:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
reverse that we have our relationships
 
03:40:27.990 --> 03:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
in the state and we plan to be here for
 
03:40:29.269 --> 03:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
the long term
 
03:40:30.830 --> 03:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
the reason why i'm here is to support
 
03:40:34.070 --> 03:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
hb601 which in no way based on my
 
03:40:35.429 --> 03:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
experience dramatically changes the
 
03:40:37.429 --> 03:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
direction the state is heading
 
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
but will ensure the protection of
 
03:40:40.229 --> 03:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
individual privacy
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's a stigma that comes with needing
 
03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
social services and it's important that
 
03:40:46.070 --> 03:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
we all recognize that that stigma exists
 
03:40:47.910 --> 03:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
for example on our network we see search
 
03:40:49.349 --> 03:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
activity in new hampshire for food and
 
03:40:51.190 --> 03:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
housing but we also see a rising need
 
03:40:53.429 --> 03:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
for addiction services mental health
 
03:40:56.309 --> 03:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
counseling even domestic abuse support
 
03:40:57.830 --> 03:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
we certainly believe the ability to
 
03:40:59.830 --> 03:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
quickly refer people to help is critical
 
03:41:01.910 --> 03:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
during an economic crisis
 
03:41:03.190 --> 03:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
with a growing need for electronic
 
03:41:04.630 --> 03:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
access to social services comes a
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
corresponding need to make sure people's
 
03:41:08.229 --> 03:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
information is protected on our networks
 
03:41:09.670 --> 03:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
we do not share personal information
 
03:41:11.429 --> 03:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
unless the person in need knows who has
 
03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
access to it
 
03:41:14.150 --> 03:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
right now that's not the way new
 
03:41:15.429 --> 03:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire is heading in fact the state
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
identified it was looking for a company
 
03:41:19.110 --> 03:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
that embraced an all-in-consent approach
 
03:41:20.550 --> 03:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
i would quote reduce the number of
 
03:41:22.389 --> 03:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
informed consents needed
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
to connect clients with services
 
03:41:27.110 --> 03:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
the approach outlined in the contract
 
03:41:28.550 --> 03:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
would then create a master client index
 
03:41:29.910 --> 03:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
in which members of the network could
 
03:41:31.510 --> 03:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
indeed search
 
03:41:33.030 --> 03:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
and retrieve people's personal
 
03:41:34.870 --> 03:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
information now some would say that's
 
03:41:36.870 --> 03:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
perfectly okay since the person in need
 
03:41:38.950 --> 03:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
is agreeing to an informed consent
 
03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
the trouble with the all in consent
 
03:41:42.389 --> 03:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
described is that not only
 
03:41:44.469 --> 03:41:44.479 align:start position:0%
is it truly informed since the network
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
of individuals and organizations that
 
03:41:48.790 --> 03:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
could have access is not defined the
 
03:41:50.710 --> 03:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
term network is vague the person has no
 
03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
idea who can see their information now
 
03:41:53.750 --> 03:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
or in the future
 
03:41:55.910 --> 03:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
who makes up the network the network as
 
03:41:57.670 --> 03:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
currently defined can be anybody who has
 
03:41:59.190 --> 03:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
been trained in works or volunteers at
 
03:42:01.990 --> 03:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
any non-profit healthcare institution
 
03:42:03.750 --> 03:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
or government agency in the entire state
 
03:42:06.790 --> 03:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire so this imposes ethical
 
03:42:08.469 --> 03:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
important ethical considerations would
 
03:42:10.070 --> 03:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
people that receive this help in this
 
03:42:11.750 --> 03:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
manner worry that someone in their
 
03:42:13.349 --> 03:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
church might find out that they were
 
03:42:16.309 --> 03:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
survivors of incest or domestic abuse
 
03:42:17.830 --> 03:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
what if the person needing help worked
 
03:42:19.349 --> 03:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
at the state and they were going through
 
03:42:21.030 --> 03:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
some tough financial times would they
 
03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
worry that their coworkers might know
 
03:42:24.950 --> 03:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
that they can't feed their family
 
03:42:26.389 --> 03:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
public health agencies are spending a
 
03:42:28.070 --> 03:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
lot of time and attention addressing the
 
03:42:29.830 --> 03:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
social determinants of health because
 
03:42:31.510 --> 03:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
studies show that if people's basic
 
03:42:34.389 --> 03:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
needs are met they tend to be healthier
 
03:42:36.630 --> 03:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
some may say that all in consent is
 
03:42:38.309 --> 03:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
needed to perform care coordination of
 
03:42:39.830 --> 03:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
our neediest among us
 
03:42:42.070 --> 03:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
our organizations has set up these types
 
03:42:43.590 --> 03:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
of networks with over 300 customers and
 
03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
millions of people and in no way has
 
03:42:47.110 --> 03:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
care coordination been hindered by a
 
03:42:49.349 --> 03:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
truly informed consent model as it
 
03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
currently stands the consent process
 
03:42:52.389 --> 03:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
does not appropriately consider these
 
03:42:53.910 --> 03:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
ethical dilemmas about information
 
03:42:53.920 --> 03:42:54.870 align:start position:0%
ethical dilemmas about information
sharing

03:42:54.870 --> 03:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
sharing
 
03:42:56.150 --> 03:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's why we would support a better
 
03:42:58.710 --> 03:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
approach like the one outlined in hb 601
 
03:43:00.070 --> 03:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
that should create the right balance
 
03:43:01.910 --> 03:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
between the state's interests and which
 
03:43:03.429 --> 03:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
are very important interests outlined by
 
03:43:05.510 --> 03:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
the department and that of your citizens
 
03:43:08.550 --> 03:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:11.030 --> 03:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%

03:43:14.790 --> 03:43:14.800 align:start position:0%

03:43:17.269 --> 03:43:17.279 align:start position:0%

speak very briefly on house bill 601
 
03:45:57.199 --> 03:45:58.630 align:start position:0%
speak very briefly on house bill 601
um

03:45:58.630 --> 03:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:00.630 --> 03:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
much of what i wanted to say was was
 
03:46:03.429 --> 03:46:03.439 align:start position:0%
encompassed in dr ballard's testimony
 
03:46:05.110 --> 03:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:46:07.590 --> 03:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
mr kirk's testimony
 
03:46:09.030 --> 03:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
but i would simply like to make the
 
03:46:11.349 --> 03:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
point that i understand from
 
03:46:11.359 --> 03:46:12.630 align:start position:0%
point that i understand from
um

03:46:12.630 --> 03:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:14.309 --> 03:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
representative ammon's testimony that
 
03:46:15.910 --> 03:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill
 
03:46:19.030 --> 03:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
was to require a consent form to have
 
03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
one's name entered into a registry being
 
03:46:23.030 --> 03:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
established by the department of health
 
03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
03:46:25.990 --> 03:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
however the plain language of the bill
 
03:46:27.910 --> 03:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that anywhere
 
03:46:30.950 --> 03:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and by the plain language of the bill
 
03:46:33.349 --> 03:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's very broad as dr ballard pointed
 
03:46:35.830 --> 03:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
out and very general and would apply to
 
03:46:37.910 --> 03:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
all health care as i read it to all
 
03:46:39.750 --> 03:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
health care providers under any
 
03:46:39.760 --> 03:46:41.429 align:start position:0%
health care providers under any
circumstances

03:46:41.429 --> 03:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
03:46:44.710 --> 03:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
what that would mean to me as the
 
03:46:46.389 --> 03:46:46.399 align:start position:0%
owner and operator of friendship manner
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
in new ipswich which is a residential
 
03:46:50.469 --> 03:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
care or assisted living home
 
03:46:52.710 --> 03:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
is that if i had a resident who came in
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
and opted out in other words if they
 
03:46:57.110 --> 03:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
said no i don't give my permission
 
03:46:58.630 --> 03:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
by the plain language of the bill it
 
03:47:01.030 --> 03:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
appears to me that if mrs jones who came
 
03:47:03.429 --> 03:47:03.439 align:start position:0%
in and opted out later had a stroke and
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
i had to send her out to the hospital
 
03:47:07.750 --> 03:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
without her specific commission
 
03:47:09.269 --> 03:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
permission which she might not be able
 
03:47:11.030 --> 03:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
to give i couldn't tell the hospital her
 
03:47:11.040 --> 03:47:11.990 align:start position:0%
to give i couldn't tell the hospital her
name

03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
name
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
her address her phone number
 
03:47:17.189 --> 03:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
her social security number her insurance
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
number or any other demographic
 
03:47:20.389 --> 03:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
information that the hospital would
 
03:47:20.399 --> 03:47:21.429 align:start position:0%
information that the hospital would
require

03:47:21.429 --> 03:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
require
 
03:47:23.830 --> 03:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
um so my point is simply that the bill
 
03:47:26.389 --> 03:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
as written doesn't really address what
 
03:47:29.110 --> 03:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's trying to achieve and is britain
 
03:47:30.710 --> 03:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
much too generally
 
03:47:32.790 --> 03:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much would you take
 
03:47:35.910 --> 03:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
questions mr cahoon i would be happy to
 
03:47:37.750 --> 03:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
does anyone have a question for mr
 
03:47:41.750 --> 03:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:44.070 --> 03:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
 
03:47:44.080 --> 03:47:45.830 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
chairman

03:47:45.830 --> 03:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:47:48.070 --> 03:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
mr cahoon are you aware that there are
 
03:47:50.229 --> 03:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
provisions in the health information
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
portability and accountability act
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
for giving information in emergency
 
03:47:58.630 --> 03:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
situations to providers who will be
 
03:48:00.309 --> 03:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
continuing here
 
03:48:01.349 --> 03:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
i am
 
03:48:03.910 --> 03:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
and uh upon admission we have residents
 
03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:05.279 align:start position:0%

03:48:08.950 --> 03:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
a release of information in an emergency
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's also true under the hipaa act
 
03:48:12.389 --> 03:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
for example that the fact that a
 
03:48:14.950 --> 03:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
resident is a is at friendship manner is
 
03:48:19.349 --> 03:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:21.990 --> 03:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:27.269 --> 03:48:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:27.279 --> 03:48:28.229 align:start position:0%
 
up

03:48:28.229 --> 03:48:28.239 align:start position:0%

03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:33.110 --> 03:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
you've got you
 
03:57:33.120 --> 03:57:40.950 align:start position:0%
you've got you
you

03:57:40.950 --> 03:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:40.960 --> 03:59:48.229 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:59:48.229 --> 03:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:48.239 --> 04:18:21.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:18:21.030 --> 04:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
i'm getting a message from ms dyer
 
04:18:25.510 --> 04:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
saying if somebody in the committee room
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:35.040 --> 04:18:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
ugh

04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:00.469 --> 04:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
it appears to me that the committee room
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
is still muted
 
04:19:05.110 --> 04:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
i think he's waiting for a couple
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
minutes until lunch is officially over
 
04:19:10.710 --> 04:19:10.720 align:start position:0%

now

04:19:22.630 --> 04:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:19:22.640 --> 04:19:29.030 align:start position:0%
now
i

04:19:29.030 --> 04:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
i feel like can't living in that
 
04:19:32.950 --> 04:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
commercial can you hear me now

yeah i'm going to encourage i'm going to
 
04:19:37.990 --> 04:19:38.000 align:start position:0%

you
 
04:19:43.110 --> 04:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
because we waste
 
04:19:45.910 --> 04:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
20 seconds every time
 
04:19:48.710 --> 04:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
waiting nobody says nothing
 
04:19:51.349 --> 04:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's not that easy it takes me that
 
04:19:55.349 --> 04:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
long for them to be moved over from the
 
04:19:55.359 --> 04:19:56.630 align:start position:0%
long for them to be moved over from the
list

04:19:56.630 --> 04:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
list
 
04:19:59.750 --> 04:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's waiting to testify to the
 
04:20:03.110 --> 04:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh list of people who are
 
04:20:06.389 --> 04:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
authorized to testify so most of them do
 
04:20:09.030 --> 04:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
actually unmute quite promptly once they
 
04:20:12.389 --> 04:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
have gotten the ability to do so
 
04:20:14.550 --> 04:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
i mean it only takes a split second to
 
04:20:17.349 --> 04:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
say please unmute
 
04:20:21.670 --> 04:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
this is the continuation of the hearing
 
04:20:28.710 --> 04:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
on house bill 246 establishing
 
04:20:32.149 --> 04:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
a protective order for vulnerable adults
 
04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 246
 
04:20:39.670 --> 04:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
and we have what i see to be only
 
04:20:39.680 --> 04:20:40.630 align:start position:0%
and we have what i see to be only
six

04:20:40.630 --> 04:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
six
 
04:20:44.469 --> 04:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
people signed up to testify
 
04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
on today's list
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
christina do you see more than six
 
04:20:52.469 --> 04:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
they're actually uh closer to 12 but i
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
do think that some folks from the prior
 
04:20:56.950 --> 04:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
hearing may not have signed up this time
 
04:20:58.870 --> 04:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
so there may be some hands that come in
 
04:21:01.510 --> 04:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
i did see some as late as
 
04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
people signing up as late as noon
 
04:21:09.110 --> 04:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
at this point since there are only 12
 
04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
we will allow each person testifying
 
04:21:15.750 --> 04:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
two minutes and after two minutes the
 
04:21:18.630 --> 04:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
individual will be muted no one will
 
04:21:21.030 --> 04:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
hear anything else after two minutes and
 
04:21:23.349 --> 04:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
we will go on to the next person
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
we do this to allow everyone who wishes
 
04:21:30.149 --> 04:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
to speak the opportunity to do so
 
04:21:33.110 --> 04:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
and so that we may finish our schedule
 
04:21:33.120 --> 04:21:34.149 align:start position:0%
and so that we may finish our schedule
because

04:21:34.149 --> 04:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:21:36.469 --> 04:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
of the covid virus we
 
04:21:39.910 --> 04:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
are way behind in the work we need to do
 
04:21:42.469 --> 04:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
with that the chair recognizes
 
04:21:42.479 --> 04:21:43.910 align:start position:0%
with that the chair recognizes
representative

04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%

04:21:54.229 --> 04:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:57.189 --> 04:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
an island republican attorney who moved
 
04:22:00.790 --> 04:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:09.030 --> 04:22:09.040 align:start position:0%

04:22:25.269 --> 04:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
i don't see that that's the number
 
04:22:25.279 --> 04:22:26.550 align:start position:0%
i don't see that that's the number

04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
for that chairman would you like me to

04:22:38.790 --> 04:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
then ask people once they hear their
 
04:22:40.469 --> 04:22:40.479 align:start position:0%

04:22:43.910 --> 04:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
hand is raised the chair recognizes doug
 
04:22:46.469 --> 04:22:46.479 align:start position:0%

04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%

time but i just wanted my name is doug

mcnutt for the record and i'm the
 
04:23:10.469 --> 04:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
associate state director for advocacy
 
04:23:12.630 --> 04:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
for aarp new hampshire

and we represent over 220 000 members
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
statewide in new hampshire
 
04:23:19.670 --> 04:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
in a past life
 
04:23:21.990 --> 04:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
i was the director of elderly and adult
 
04:23:23.750 --> 04:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
services and
 
04:23:25.510 --> 04:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
i was responsible for the adult
 
04:23:27.349 --> 04:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
protection program
 
04:23:29.269 --> 04:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
and have been involved in a series of
 
04:23:31.990 --> 04:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation related to elder
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect
 
04:23:35.750 --> 04:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
and exploitation
 
04:23:38.070 --> 04:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to just comment on a few
 
04:23:39.750 --> 04:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
things and then i'd be happy to answer
 
04:23:43.110 --> 04:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
any questions first of all
 
04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
a lot was raised at the hearing about
 
04:23:48.950 --> 04:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know due process issues and i guess
 
04:23:50.870 --> 04:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
the one thing i would just like to point
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
out is that a lot of this bill is based
 
04:23:55.510 --> 04:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
on the domestic violence statute which
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
has been in effect for many years i
 
04:23:59.189 --> 04:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
think perhaps 20
 
04:24:01.429 --> 04:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
and has worked fairly well and the
 
04:24:04.550 --> 04:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
courts are quite used to it
 
04:24:06.469 --> 04:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
with regard to some of the other pieces
 
04:24:09.750 --> 04:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
related to firearms and pieces like that
 
04:24:11.670 --> 04:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
it's my impression that people might
 
04:24:13.910 --> 04:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
have been really kind of testifying to
 
04:24:15.990 --> 04:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
previous versions of the bill it's my
 
04:24:17.670 --> 04:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
sense that the bill has been
 
04:24:17.680 --> 04:24:18.950 align:start position:0%
sense that the bill has been
dramatically

04:24:18.950 --> 04:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
04:24:18.960 --> 04:24:19.990 align:start position:0%
dramatically
um

04:24:19.990 --> 04:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:23.269 --> 04:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
altered since that for those first
 
04:24:25.750 --> 04:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
couple of sessions and i'm not sure that
 
04:24:28.149 --> 04:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
that stuff remains relevant
 
04:24:29.830 --> 04:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh at this point
 
04:24:32.149 --> 04:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
so i think it's really important we
 
04:24:33.990 --> 04:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
focus on the bill and its current
 
04:24:37.349 --> 04:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
iteration and not be focused on what
 
04:24:40.469 --> 04:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
what it was at one time and lastly i
 
04:24:42.550 --> 04:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
just let me just say that
 
04:24:45.030 --> 04:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
in my experience in working with adult
 
04:24:45.040 --> 04:24:47.110 align:start position:0%
in my experience in working with adult
protection

04:24:47.110 --> 04:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
protection
 
04:24:49.030 --> 04:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of and also with the criminal
 
04:24:51.189 --> 04:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
justice system a lot of the justice
 
04:24:54.309 --> 04:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
happens after the fact and particularly
 
04:24:56.710 --> 04:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about things like
 
04:24:56.720 --> 04:24:58.550 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about things like
exploitation

04:24:58.550 --> 04:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
exploitation
 
04:25:01.670 --> 04:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
once the crime has been committed it's
 
04:25:03.510 --> 04:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
fine to prosecute
 
04:25:06.149 --> 04:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
the perpetrator but if the money is gone
 
04:25:07.590 --> 04:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
and i think it might be that
 
04:25:09.189 --> 04:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
representative weber testified to
 
04:25:12.630 --> 04:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
something like this the last time
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's a problem because i certainly
 
04:25:16.070 --> 04:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
when i was
 
04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
working in the department of health and
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
human services as an attorney
 
04:25:21.990 --> 04:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
there were many instances where we had
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
people who were victims of exploitation
 
04:25:26.309 --> 04:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
who ended up
 
04:25:26.319 --> 04:25:27.189 align:start position:0%
who ended up
being

04:25:27.189 --> 04:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:25:29.429 --> 04:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
on medicaid and nursing homes and in
 
04:25:34.550 --> 04:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for mr
 
04:25:53.990 --> 04:25:54.000 align:start position:0%

car belongs to his son
 
04:28:33.990 --> 04:28:34.000 align:start position:0%

related to her age
 
04:28:45.429 --> 04:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
and may be
 
04:28:45.439 --> 04:28:48.309 align:start position:0%
and may be
forgetful

04:28:48.309 --> 04:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:48.319 --> 04:28:49.030 align:start position:0%

where the car was
 
04:28:53.830 --> 04:28:53.840 align:start position:0%

warner and uh

this bill should be itl this same bill
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
has essentially come up now three years
 
04:35:40.230 --> 04:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
in a row and the same people keep
 
04:35:41.830 --> 04:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
pointing out the same issues with the
 
04:35:44.709 --> 04:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
bill and nobody seems to be listening
 
04:35:46.869 --> 04:35:46.879 align:start position:0%
i really wish that folks would
 
04:35:46.879 --> 04:35:47.670 align:start position:0%
i really wish that folks would
would

04:35:47.670 --> 04:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:35:49.349 --> 04:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
pay attention
 
04:35:52.070 --> 04:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
and address the low-hanging fruit i.e
 
04:35:54.629 --> 04:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
addressing the the exploitation
 
04:35:57.750 --> 04:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know of of financial issues and and

take the rest of the the bs out of the
 
04:36:01.470 --> 04:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
bill because it would be
 
04:36:04.629 --> 04:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
non-controversial then right um the new
 
04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution article 19
 
04:36:09.510 --> 04:36:09.520 align:start position:0%

already guarantees
that

04:36:10.470 --> 04:36:10.480 align:start position:0%

the case that a person in a civil case a
 
04:36:18.390 --> 04:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
person has a right
 
04:36:20.629 --> 04:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
to a jury trial
 
04:36:23.429 --> 04:36:23.439 align:start position:0%

guarantee
 
04:36:28.150 --> 04:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
furthermore it has an a point in it
 
04:36:30.390 --> 04:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
where it says that they will be
 
04:36:30.400 --> 04:36:45.590 align:start position:0%
where it says that they will be
important

04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%

thank you my name is penny dean i'm from

concord new hampshire i'm an attorney
 
04:38:36.949 --> 04:38:36.959 align:start position:0%
licensed to practice in maine new
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire and massachusetts and admitted

to the federal courts in the united
 
04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
states district court for the district
 
04:38:44.709 --> 04:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire maine massachusetts
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
first circuit court of appeals the
 
04:38:48.390 --> 04:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
united states supreme court and the d.c
 
04:38:52.230 --> 04:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
circuit and i ask that you itl this bill
 
04:38:54.629 --> 04:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
um for those who have suggested that
 
04:38:56.470 --> 04:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
those calling in to ask that the bill be
 
04:38:59.109 --> 04:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
ital have not read the current version
 
04:39:00.551 --> 04:39:00.561 align:start position:0%
i can most certainly assure this
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
committee i and many others have read
 
04:39:04.629 --> 04:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
the current version and just because the
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
authors took the term firearms out does
 
04:39:11.029 --> 04:39:11.039 align:start position:0%
not mean that firearms will still not be
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
taken from those accused here and i can
 
04:39:15.189 --> 04:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
tell you that if i made those
 
04:39:17.429 --> 04:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
representations before a judge with this
 
04:39:19.429 --> 04:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
language i would very quickly be fined
 
04:39:22.070 --> 04:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
and sanctioned because it's disingenuous
 
04:39:23.590 --> 04:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
to say the least
 
04:39:25.990 --> 04:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
the author had admittedly
 
04:39:28.390 --> 04:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
in the initial testimony that they had
 
04:39:30.390 --> 04:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
copied federal law and that is
 
04:39:32.789 --> 04:39:32.799 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct and i think what's
 
04:39:34.470 --> 04:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
most important to know
 
04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
is if you look at federal law which is
 
04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
18 usc section 922 g8
 
04:39:44.070 --> 04:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
that is a federal prohibition
 
04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
from an order that basically says if a
 
04:39:48.868 --> 04:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
person is subject to a court order that
 
04:39:50.948 --> 04:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
restrains a person from harassing
 
04:39:53.270 --> 04:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
stalking or threatening an intimate
 
04:39:55.110 --> 04:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
partner or child of such intimate
 
04:39:57.190 --> 04:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
partner but before you say well gee
 
04:39:58.628 --> 04:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
we're not just always talking about
 
04:40:00.948 --> 04:40:00.958 align:start position:0%
intimate partners do you have to look
 
04:40:03.590 --> 04:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
further to 18 usc
 
04:40:06.550 --> 04:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
921 a 32 because the definition of
 
04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
intimate partner is not what you might
 
04:40:10.470 --> 04:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
think it is
 
04:40:13.670 --> 04:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
furthermore if one looks at page five of
 
04:40:18.708 --> 04:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
the spill line 16 through 18.
 
04:40:21.110 --> 04:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
if a person is granted relief
 
04:40:22.788 --> 04:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
the person who they're granted relief
 
04:40:22.798 --> 04:40:23.910 align:start position:0%
the person who they're granted relief
against

04:40:23.910 --> 04:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
against
 
04:40:27.190 --> 04:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
it makes it statutorily explicit a
 
04:40:30.788 --> 04:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
finding of abuse exploitation or neglect
 
04:40:33.030 --> 04:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
shall mean the defendant represents a
 
04:40:35.110 --> 04:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
credible threat to the safety of the
 
04:40:37.030 --> 04:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
plaintiff or physical mental or
 
04:40:39.590 --> 04:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
financial well-being that is exactly the
 
04:40:41.750 --> 04:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
federal language that requires they take
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
your guns away
 
04:40:45.190 --> 04:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
so for someone to say oh we took all the
 
04:40:47.190 --> 04:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
guns out of here yeah you took
 
04:40:47.200 --> 04:40:47.990 align:start position:0%
guns out of here yeah you took

04:40:47.990 --> 04:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:50.708 --> 04:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
the term firearm out of the bill
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
but what you did is leave the results in
 
04:40:59.190 --> 04:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:59.200 --> 04:41:00.868 align:start position:0%
 
wow

04:41:00.868 --> 04:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
wow
 
04:41:04.230 --> 04:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:06.788 --> 04:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
nope two minutes is for everybody

thank you counselor i'd like to call on
joseph

04:41:11.430 --> 04:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
joseph
 
04:41:13.750 --> 04:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
is it a bayer or ebert from the new
 
04:41:17.430 --> 04:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:21.270 --> 04:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
it is uh joseph ebert eb ert and i am a
 
04:41:22.708 --> 04:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
captain with the new hampshire state
 
04:41:25.270 --> 04:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
police uh thank you so much for giving
 
04:41:27.670 --> 04:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
me the opportunity to talk this morning
 
04:41:30.868 --> 04:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
or this afternoon this case may be um i
 
04:41:33.030 --> 04:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
want to say first that clearly the state
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
police is interested in
 
04:41:37.030 --> 04:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
any way of reducing
 
04:41:38.628 --> 04:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
harm to our elders
 
04:41:41.030 --> 04:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
i think as we reviewed this bill we did
 
04:41:43.190 --> 04:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
have some concern attorney dean was
 
04:41:44.948 --> 04:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
actually referring to a
 
04:41:47.190 --> 04:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
portion of the statute which caused us
 
04:41:50.390 --> 04:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
some concern uh in that it seems to uh
 
04:41:53.350 --> 04:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
take away the statute of limitations and
 
04:41:57.030 --> 04:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's under 173 d colon 6
 
04:41:59.030 --> 04:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
subsection 6
 
04:42:01.270 --> 04:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 2.
 
04:42:03.270 --> 04:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
so it seems to take away the statute of
 
04:42:03.280 --> 04:42:04.708 align:start position:0%
so it seems to take away the statute of
limitations

04:42:04.708 --> 04:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
04:42:06.628 --> 04:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
and it also puts in there that standard
 
04:42:08.550 --> 04:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
of mental well-being
 
04:42:11.030 --> 04:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
in in review and conversation about this
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
our concern was that uh if 20 to 30
 
04:42:16.708 --> 04:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
years had passed uh and somebody was
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
bringing this vote it would be very
 
04:42:20.470 --> 04:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
difficult for some a member of law
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement to determine what had caused
 
04:42:24.628 --> 04:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
the intervening
 
04:42:26.708 --> 04:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
issues in an individual's life we're all
 
04:42:28.230 --> 04:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
impacted by a number of different
 
04:42:28.240 --> 04:42:29.350 align:start position:0%
impacted by a number of different
factors

04:42:29.350 --> 04:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
factors
 
04:42:31.350 --> 04:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
so when we stretch out over a
 
04:42:33.030 --> 04:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
significant period of time it becomes
 
04:42:35.830 --> 04:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
very difficult to determine what was the
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
what is the true factor if only one uh
 
04:42:41.030 --> 04:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
that is causing a person mental uh
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
well-being stress
 
04:42:44.230 --> 04:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
so that's what we wanted to bring
 
04:42:46.150 --> 04:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
forward today and i'm certainly happy to
 
04:42:52.948 --> 04:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:59.110 --> 04:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:01.430 --> 04:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative gay has a question to
 
04:43:04.628 --> 04:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
clarify your testimony captain
 
04:43:07.110 --> 04:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
and i would ask the captain to unmute
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
because i am afraid i muted him when i
 
04:43:10.868 --> 04:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
thought there were no questions not not
 
04:43:13.030 --> 04:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
a problem i'm back
 
04:43:17.670 --> 04:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:17.680 --> 04:43:19.990 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

04:43:19.990 --> 04:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:43:23.350 --> 04:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
are you for or against this bill
 
04:43:25.670 --> 04:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
yes so the uh the division of state
 
04:43:27.910 --> 04:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
police has not taken a uh a stance on
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
the bill itself and i know that uh can
 
04:43:33.270 --> 04:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
be disappointing um to both sides
 
04:43:35.270 --> 04:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
but the direction i got was to look at
 
04:43:39.430 --> 04:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
this procedurally and not to endorse or
 
04:43:41.910 --> 04:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
oppose this particular bill
 
04:43:43.350 --> 04:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:45.510 --> 04:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you that's helpful
 
04:43:53.350 --> 04:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:56.550 --> 04:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chair and members of the
 
04:43:59.910 --> 04:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
committee my name is uh albert buzz sher
 
04:44:02.708 --> 04:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
i'm a professor at unh law the opinions
 
04:44:05.190 --> 04:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
i expressed today are mine only not
 
04:44:08.070 --> 04:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
those of unh law or unh
 
04:44:09.430 --> 04:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
in durham
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
i testify in support of
 
04:44:14.868 --> 04:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
excuse me hb246
 
04:44:17.350 --> 04:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
um i really all i want to talk about is
 
04:44:19.990 --> 04:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
there's been a good bit of hyperbole uh
 
04:44:21.990 --> 04:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
from what i've heard about the concept
 
04:44:25.030 --> 04:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
of due process and how this violates due
 
04:44:28.230 --> 04:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
process in so many different ways i
 
04:44:30.230 --> 04:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
teach in the area of due process i
 
04:44:31.590 --> 04:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
practiced in
 
04:44:33.110 --> 04:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire criminal justice
 
04:44:34.788 --> 04:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
system i'm familiar with what due
 
04:44:36.310 --> 04:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
process is
 
04:44:39.030 --> 04:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
this statute does not violate anyone's
 
04:44:41.990 --> 04:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
due process rights due process is not a
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
fixed entity
 
04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
um it is a sliding scale entity
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
depending on the nature of the right at
 
04:44:50.550 --> 04:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
stake like if we're going to violate
 
04:44:53.030 --> 04:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
your parole you have very significant
 
04:44:55.590 --> 04:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
due process rights if we're gonna you
 
04:44:57.430 --> 04:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
know take away
 
04:45:00.390 --> 04:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know a piece of candy you have
 
04:45:05.110 --> 04:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
far less due process rights um and um
 
04:45:07.110 --> 04:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
this you know i'm very familiar with
 
04:45:10.628 --> 04:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
these kind of statutes i i was opposed
 
04:45:10.638 --> 04:45:11.590 align:start position:0%
these kind of statutes i i was opposed
to

04:45:11.590 --> 04:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:45:14.948 --> 04:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
legislation last session on
 
04:45:16.868 --> 04:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
red flag legislation
 
04:45:18.310 --> 04:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
which i think
 
04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
which took away
 
04:45:21.590 --> 04:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
potentially took away someone's
 
04:45:23.510 --> 04:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to possess a gun
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
under the new hampshire
 
04:45:24.958 --> 04:45:26.628 align:start position:0%
under the new hampshire
constitution

04:45:26.628 --> 04:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
04:45:28.948 --> 04:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
and i was opposed to that legislation on
 
04:45:30.628 --> 04:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
due process rights
 
04:45:33.990 --> 04:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
this statute does not have due process
 
04:45:34.000 --> 04:45:35.030 align:start position:0%
this statute does not have due process
problems

04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
problems
 
04:45:37.590 --> 04:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh it it
 
04:45:41.350 --> 04:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
it it is uh much more moderate than the
 
04:45:43.350 --> 04:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
red flag legislation which had very
 
04:45:45.990 --> 04:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
significant due process problems uh this
 
04:45:49.030 --> 04:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
statute uh does not have uh due process
 
04:45:52.150 --> 04:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh problems i'm looking at my notes
 
04:45:54.390 --> 04:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
it is very similar to domestic violence
 
04:45:57.110 --> 04:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
statutes all of which have pro have
 
04:45:59.670 --> 04:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
survived due process challenges
 
04:45:59.680 --> 04:46:00.470 align:start position:0%
survived due process challenges
so

04:46:00.470 --> 04:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:00.480 --> 04:46:01.430 align:start position:0%
so
given

04:46:01.430 --> 04:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
given
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
the rights that are at stake here
 
04:46:07.830 --> 04:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
as compared to those rights at stake
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
when more significant due process is
 
04:46:09.840 --> 04:46:10.868 align:start position:0%
when more significant due process is
given

04:46:10.868 --> 04:46:10.878 align:start position:0%
given
 
04:46:13.270 --> 04:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think as a constitutional matter
 
04:46:18.868 --> 04:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
thank you professor sure for your
 
04:46:20.878 --> 04:46:24.310 align:start position:0%

this bill it is good to know that a
 
04:46:51.030 --> 04:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
number of people have brought up the
 
04:46:53.590 --> 04:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
fact that firearms issues are in fact
 
04:46:55.270 --> 04:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
related to this bill

as the opponents of the bill recognize
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
the fact that this has real issues
 
04:47:02.788 --> 04:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
regarding the firearm the
 
04:47:02.798 --> 04:47:03.510 align:start position:0%
regarding the firearm the
the

04:47:05.270 --> 04:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
for the firearms owners in the state of
 
04:47:08.868 --> 04:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire as well as for the elders
 
04:47:10.868 --> 04:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
those who want to pass this bill claim
 
04:47:13.270 --> 04:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's about financial issues however they
 
04:47:15.350 --> 04:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
have not written a bill that does that
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is verbatim with house bill
 
04:47:21.030 --> 04:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
1660 as vetoed by the governor less than
 
04:47:22.230 --> 04:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
a year ago
 
04:47:23.910 --> 04:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
i would ask that the committee fined
 
04:47:27.750 --> 04:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
this bill itl until the the issues
 
04:47:30.230 --> 04:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
um that were in the bill last year are
 
04:47:30.240 --> 04:47:31.430 align:start position:0%
um that were in the bill last year are
resolved

04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
04:47:33.670 --> 04:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
minor tweaks are not sufficient
 
04:47:36.230 --> 04:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
it is clear from the language that you
 
04:47:38.070 --> 04:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
violate numerous protections in our
 
04:47:40.788 --> 04:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
constitution both state and federal
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
till that language is corrected please
 
04:47:46.150 --> 04:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
kill this bill thank you
 
04:47:47.670 --> 04:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:47:49.990 --> 04:47:50.000 align:start position:0%

04:48:00.550 --> 04:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:02.788 --> 04:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay yes we can
 
04:48:05.670 --> 04:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh sorry that i was delayed my schedule
 
04:48:08.788 --> 04:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
is all messed up uh i'm speaking for
 
04:48:08.798 --> 04:48:09.990 align:start position:0%
is all messed up uh i'm speaking for
myself

04:48:09.990 --> 04:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
myself
 
04:48:12.628 --> 04:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh i'm opposed to the bill i call this
 
04:48:12.638 --> 04:48:13.510 align:start position:0%
uh i'm opposed to the bill i call this
bill

04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:48:15.990 --> 04:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
as a zombie bill because it was killed
 
04:48:18.310 --> 04:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
in the last biennium in a different form
 
04:48:19.910 --> 04:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
a slightly different form
 
04:48:22.070 --> 04:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's been brought forth in another like
 
04:48:24.070 --> 04:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
i said a slightly different form
 
04:48:25.270 --> 04:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
even though
 
04:48:26.788 --> 04:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
the proponents would like to say it has
 
04:48:28.550 --> 04:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with second amendment or
 
04:48:30.150 --> 04:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
firearms issues
 
04:48:32.470 --> 04:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
it really does that's the undercurrent
 
04:48:35.750 --> 04:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
here and this is just a a a disguised
 
04:48:35.760 --> 04:48:36.628 align:start position:0%
here and this is just a a a disguised
effort

04:48:36.628 --> 04:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
effort
 
04:48:39.910 --> 04:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
to without very much due process
 
04:48:42.708 --> 04:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
seize firearms from people that someone
 
04:48:45.510 --> 04:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
else thinks are vulnerable and it's
 
04:48:47.030 --> 04:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
something that is really
 
04:48:49.190 --> 04:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
against the constitution so i would urge
 
04:48:50.708 --> 04:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
that the committee find it inexpedient
 
04:48:52.708 --> 04:48:52.718 align:start position:0%
to legislate thank you
 
04:48:54.948 --> 04:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
thank you representative the chair calls
 
04:49:00.948 --> 04:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:03.430 --> 04:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh hello uh good afternoon members of
 
04:49:05.350 --> 04:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is joe hannon i'm
 
04:49:07.910 --> 04:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
a former state rep and also i'm a vice
 
04:49:09.190 --> 04:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
president for gun owners of new
 
04:49:09.200 --> 04:49:10.150 align:start position:0%
president for gun owners of new
hampshire

04:49:10.150 --> 04:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:49:12.470 --> 04:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh i'm testifying in opposition to this
 
04:49:14.708 --> 04:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
bill and we ask the itl it i don't want
 
04:49:16.070 --> 04:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
to repeat what everyone else has said
 
04:49:18.070 --> 04:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
like penny dean about
 
04:49:18.080 --> 04:49:19.030 align:start position:0%
like penny dean about
the

04:49:19.030 --> 04:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:49:21.510 --> 04:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
legal implications of why this is wrong
 
04:49:23.590 --> 04:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
but i do want to just reiterate one
 
04:49:25.910 --> 04:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
thing the it does
 
04:49:27.830 --> 04:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
even though the the authors of the bill
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
have claimed that it's removed the words
 
04:49:30.788 --> 04:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
firearms and i believe the original
 
04:49:32.150 --> 04:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
versions this bill had firearms
 
04:49:34.628 --> 04:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned 30 plus times in it
 
04:49:37.190 --> 04:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh taking the words out and changing
 
04:49:39.510 --> 04:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
some of the language does not remove the
 
04:49:41.350 --> 04:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
fact that this would trigger a federal
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
prohibition to own firearms for many
 
04:49:43.760 --> 04:49:45.510 align:start position:0%
prohibition to own firearms for many
people

04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:49:48.070 --> 04:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
and there are ways to do that in cases
 
04:49:49.750 --> 04:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence and other abuse and
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
other crimes but this expands that even
 
04:49:54.868 --> 04:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
greater in an area that i i don't think
 
04:49:57.590 --> 04:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
people are comprehending um from one
 
04:49:59.750 --> 04:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
side of this debate so we ask that you
 
04:50:02.310 --> 04:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
itl this bill and um
 
04:50:04.070 --> 04:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's about it i appreciate it thank
 
04:50:04.080 --> 04:50:05.030 align:start position:0%
that's about it i appreciate it thank
you

04:50:05.030 --> 04:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:50:07.110 --> 04:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:50:09.270 --> 04:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes john
 
04:50:09.280 --> 04:50:13.910 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes john
schmidt

04:50:13.910 --> 04:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i just like to say that i agree
 
04:50:17.350 --> 04:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
with a whole bunch of others here who
 
04:50:17.360 --> 04:50:18.550 align:start position:0%
with a whole bunch of others here who
have

04:50:18.550 --> 04:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:50:20.230 --> 04:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
i think correctly said that this could
 
04:50:22.868 --> 04:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
be used for gun confiscation
 
04:50:24.868 --> 04:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
but my concern is not just gun
 
04:50:26.628 --> 04:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
confiscation it's confiscation of
 
04:50:26.638 --> 04:50:27.830 align:start position:0%
confiscation it's confiscation of
anything

04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:50:29.430 --> 04:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
i don't believe the government should be
 
04:50:30.948 --> 04:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
able to
 
04:50:34.070 --> 04:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
confiscate life liberty or property
 
04:50:36.390 --> 04:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
without due process and constitutionally
 
04:50:38.550 --> 04:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
due process as a trial by jury of your
 
04:50:38.560 --> 04:50:39.830 align:start position:0%
due process as a trial by jury of your
peers

04:50:39.830 --> 04:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
peers
 
04:50:41.190 --> 04:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
not even
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
by just a ruling of an unelected judge
 
04:50:45.990 --> 04:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i think in new hampshire all our
 
04:50:47.830 --> 04:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
judges are unelected
 
04:50:49.590 --> 04:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:50:50.868 --> 04:50:50.878 align:start position:0%

04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
is simply going to be railroaded
 
04:52:48.550 --> 04:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
i speak from experience not in new
 
04:52:51.110 --> 04:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire but in massachusetts
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
a lawless licensor
 
04:52:56.868 --> 04:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts who wasn't as an
 
04:52:56.878 --> 04:52:57.910 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts who wasn't as an
attorney

04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
04:53:00.628 --> 04:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
determined that he was going to revoke
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
my license to carry firearms he did sell
 
04:53:06.788 --> 04:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
it costs
 
04:53:09.510 --> 04:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
well over a hundred thousand dollars for
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
me to get back my license which was
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
restored to me by order of the supreme
 
04:53:17.190 --> 04:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
judicial court of massachusetts from
 
04:53:19.750 --> 04:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
which you can reasonably infer i had
 
04:53:25.190 --> 04:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:33.030 --> 04:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:35.270 --> 04:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
i did not give
 
04:53:37.030 --> 04:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
people the chance i didn't look around
 
04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
the room i didn't look at my phone
 
04:53:41.030 --> 04:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
i think there may have been a question
 
04:53:43.910 --> 04:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
for uh penny dean a lawyer who had
 
04:53:46.830 --> 04:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
testified before and
 
04:53:51.190 --> 04:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
i miss dean wishes to come back um
 
04:53:52.470 --> 04:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
what i'll do
 
04:53:55.110 --> 04:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh is give you about a half a minute for
 
04:53:57.990 --> 04:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
a rape raise or an additional point and
 
04:54:00.150 --> 04:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
then to be fair see if there's a
 
04:54:02.070 --> 04:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
question for you in your professional
 
04:54:05.830 --> 04:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
capacity so please unmute penny dean for
 
04:54:08.948 --> 04:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:11.590 --> 04:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
this dean is unmuted
 
04:54:13.750 --> 04:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chair yes and i want to
 
04:54:16.150 --> 04:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
apologize for speaking so fast i had
 
04:54:18.708 --> 04:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
many many more points to make but given
 
04:54:21.830 --> 04:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
the allotted time i could not make them
 
04:54:23.910 --> 04:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
i respectfully disagree with my
 
04:54:26.788 --> 04:54:26.798 align:start position:0%
professor that due process is
 
04:54:29.510 --> 04:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
solved in this particular bill there's
 
04:54:32.230 --> 04:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
been different iterations but the way it
 
04:54:34.550 --> 04:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
is now because it mirrors the language
 
04:54:36.628 --> 04:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
of federal law
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
04:54:40.230 --> 04:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
the state police has also identified one
 
04:54:42.470 --> 04:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
of the many many flaws in the bill and
 
04:54:44.788 --> 04:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
because i'm given 30 seconds i can't go
 
04:54:46.550 --> 04:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
through them but i'm happy to answer any
 
04:54:48.708 --> 04:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
questions that committee members may
 
04:54:50.628 --> 04:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
have and point out many other defects in
 
04:54:54.708 --> 04:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:56.390 --> 04:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
i'm going to allow one question and
 
04:54:58.070 --> 04:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
again that is because this is a bit
 
04:55:01.270 --> 04:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
unusual so i'll allow one question and
 
04:55:01.280 --> 04:55:02.550 align:start position:0%
unusual so i'll allow one question and
if

04:55:02.550 --> 04:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:55:04.310 --> 04:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative folsom would pose her
 
04:55:07.110 --> 04:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman um thank
 
04:55:08.868 --> 04:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
you ms dean
 
04:55:10.868 --> 04:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
my question is um
 
04:55:12.948 --> 04:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that you did talk really
 
04:55:15.350 --> 04:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
really fast and i was not able to jot
 
04:55:17.430 --> 04:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
down some of the things you said
 
04:55:20.788 --> 04:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to submit some
 
04:55:24.390 --> 04:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
written testimony with the information
 
04:55:26.788 --> 04:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
04:55:26.798 --> 04:55:27.990 align:start position:0%
to the committee
email

04:55:27.990 --> 04:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
email
 
04:55:33.030 --> 04:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:36.310 --> 04:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
she's muted i bet if she's muted you can
 
04:55:37.510 --> 04:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
unmute her
 
04:55:39.750 --> 04:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
for her answer to that question and that
 
04:55:39.760 --> 04:55:41.830 align:start position:0%
for her answer to that question and that
only

04:55:41.830 --> 04:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:55:43.990 --> 04:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
he is available i can't unmute her she
 
04:55:47.750 --> 04:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
has to unmute herself i did on mute my
 
04:55:49.590 --> 04:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
can you hear me because i did unmute
 
04:55:49.600 --> 04:55:51.430 align:start position:0%
can you hear me because i did unmute
myself

04:55:51.430 --> 04:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
myself
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
so the question is and this is all we're
 
04:55:55.670 --> 04:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
recognizing you for is will you submit
 
04:55:57.990 --> 04:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
written testimony to the committee of
 
04:56:00.788 --> 04:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
everything else you have to say
 
04:56:03.270 --> 04:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
um with all due respect i don't think i
 
04:56:05.590 --> 04:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
have the time to do that in order to do
 
04:56:07.590 --> 04:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
that properly in a lawyer job would
 
04:56:09.750 --> 04:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
probably take about six hours because
 
04:56:11.830 --> 04:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
there are huge flaws
 
04:56:13.750 --> 04:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i started to write them down just to
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
prepare for this hearing took a couple
 
04:56:18.868 --> 04:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
hours thank you you have
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
used your time
 
04:56:22.390 --> 04:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else
 
04:56:26.550 --> 04:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:32.390 --> 04:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:35.030 --> 04:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
in which case
 
04:56:36.708 --> 04:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
04:56:41.670 --> 04:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
closed this hearing on house bill 246
 
04:56:43.750 --> 04:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
and i do have a question for my
 
04:56:46.868 --> 04:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
predecessor i have several bills in my
 
04:56:48.390 --> 04:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
exec file
 
04:56:52.628 --> 04:56:52.638 align:start position:0%
but none of them was from today
 
04:56:56.230 --> 04:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
and am i correct in believing that
 
04:56:59.590 --> 04:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
while i may exec any bill from today
 
04:57:01.750 --> 04:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
in order to exec a previous bill that
 
04:57:05.430 --> 04:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
must be published noticed uh much as i
 
04:57:08.868 --> 04:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
hate to admit it no no mr chairman what
 
04:57:08.878 --> 04:57:09.750 align:start position:0%
hate to admit it no no mr chairman what
the

04:57:09.750 --> 04:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:57:13.430 --> 04:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
notice says is that executive session on
 
04:57:15.910 --> 04:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
pending legislation which is all pending
 
04:57:15.920 --> 04:57:17.350 align:start position:0%
pending legislation which is all pending
legislation

04:57:17.350 --> 04:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:57:19.270 --> 04:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
may be held throughout the day time
 
04:57:21.110 --> 04:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
permitting from the time the committee
 
04:57:23.190 --> 04:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
is initially convened
 
04:57:26.708 --> 04:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
so um that is the notice and under the
 
04:57:28.868 --> 04:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
notice that has been given
 
04:57:31.350 --> 04:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
you are free to take up any bill that
 
04:57:34.390 --> 04:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
has finished its hearing
 
04:57:37.750 --> 04:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
with no disrespect to uh your yourself
 
04:57:37.760 --> 04:57:38.628 align:start position:0%
with no disrespect to uh your yourself
or

04:57:38.628 --> 04:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:57:40.390 --> 04:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
your wisdom
 
04:57:42.708 --> 04:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
i would like to uh put everything on
 
04:57:44.470 --> 04:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
mute for about five minutes so i can
 
04:57:47.190 --> 04:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
call the clerk for confirmation of that
 
04:57:50.470 --> 04:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
i would be i would feel safe for myself
 
04:57:53.270 --> 04:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
i'm entirely happy for you to do so it's
 
04:57:55.430 --> 04:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's a policy i disagree with but i
 
04:57:57.430 --> 04:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
think that that's what the policy is but
 
04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
by all means be guided by the clerk
 
04:58:00.788 --> 04:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:58:02.550 --> 04:58:02.560 align:start position:0%

04:58:08.070 --> 04:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
missed this
 
04:58:10.310 --> 04:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
during the testimony there was a person
 
04:58:12.868 --> 04:58:12.878 align:start position:0%
named mike thornton who had written in
 
04:58:15.190 --> 04:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
an email to the committee stating that
 
04:58:17.830 --> 04:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
he had waited to testify before and
 
04:58:19.830 --> 04:58:19.840 align:start position:0%

i asked him to raise his hand at the end
 
04:58:31.030 --> 04:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
if he had not been called upon and i
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
didn't act quickly enough to let you
 
04:58:34.868 --> 04:58:34.878 align:start position:0%

warm and friendly as this group is the
 
04:59:39.670 --> 04:59:39.680 align:start position:0%

that made it feel all soft cozy and
 
05:00:43.830 --> 05:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
cuddly for her daughter
 
05:00:45.750 --> 05:00:45.760 align:start position:0%

we are set
 
05:01:26.310 --> 05:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
and the ruling from
 
05:01:27.990 --> 05:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
cleric is yes we can exec

that i think we could all pretty well
 
05:01:52.868 --> 05:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
get our minds around

lundgren a chiropractor who also
 
05:02:38.390 --> 05:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
represents rockingham district 5 and i
 
05:02:40.470 --> 05:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
had a lengthy conversation about the
 
05:02:40.480 --> 05:02:41.350 align:start position:0%
had a lengthy conversation about the
bill

05:02:41.350 --> 05:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:02:41.360 --> 05:02:42.708 align:start position:0%
bill
and

05:02:42.708 --> 05:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:02:42.718 --> 05:02:43.670 align:start position:0%
and
we

05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:02:46.230 --> 05:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
if you remember most of us found there
 
05:02:48.390 --> 05:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
was some really good ideas and certainly
 
05:02:50.868 --> 05:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
great sentiment in this but it sure
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't ready for prime time
 
05:02:55.510 --> 05:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
nor could we probably get it ready on
 
05:02:57.510 --> 05:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
the on the fast
 
05:03:00.230 --> 05:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
so what he suggested
 
05:03:01.990 --> 05:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
is that we retain
 
05:03:03.830 --> 05:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:03:05.910 --> 05:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
he will work on it we will send it out
 
05:03:09.830 --> 05:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
for a fiscal note and um
 
05:03:13.110 --> 05:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
that would be the motion that the bill's
 
05:03:16.390 --> 05:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
primary sponsor is comfortable with over
 
05:03:18.470 --> 05:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
the summer we would get
 
05:03:20.310 --> 05:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
some folks together and work on this
 
05:03:23.110 --> 05:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
bill and come fall we would see it in a
 
05:03:25.590 --> 05:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
much improved version
 
05:03:28.470 --> 05:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
so i would entertain on his behalf
 
05:03:34.310 --> 05:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:38.628 --> 05:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:38.638 --> 05:03:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:03:40.550 --> 05:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:03:42.868 --> 05:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
representative gay so moved and
 
05:03:45.190 --> 05:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
05:03:47.030 --> 05:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
seconded it
 
05:03:47.040 --> 05:03:48.230 align:start position:0%
seconded it
and

05:03:48.230 --> 05:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:49.750 --> 05:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
we thank you for representative
 
05:03:52.628 --> 05:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
soloway's enthusiasm as always
 
05:03:55.990 --> 05:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
so any question on this bill
 
05:04:04.788 --> 05:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:07.910 --> 05:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
i see no hands up mr chairman i would
 
05:04:10.470 --> 05:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
just state for myself if you would care
 
05:04:12.868 --> 05:04:12.878 align:start position:0%
to recognize me i recognize
 
05:04:16.230 --> 05:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
representative webber thank you um i
 
05:04:17.670 --> 05:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
would just say i think that that's a
 
05:04:19.750 --> 05:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
very good resolution i think there's
 
05:04:23.590 --> 05:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
some some excellent policy in the bill
 
05:04:27.750 --> 05:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
but i also think that the execution is
 
05:04:29.750 --> 05:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
going to be really difficult as written
 
05:04:32.310 --> 05:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
so i i think that working on it some
 
05:04:34.628 --> 05:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
more is a very good idea
 
05:04:38.868 --> 05:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:41.350 --> 05:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
marsh waving his hand representative

people who like to fix things
 
05:04:57.350 --> 05:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
and she says oh
 
05:05:01.350 --> 05:05:01.360 align:start position:0%

05:05:05.280 --> 05:05:06.230 align:start position:0%
nurses art therapists counselors and the
like

05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%

05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%

05:05:11.750 --> 05:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's new york sarcasm coming from her
 
05:05:16.230 --> 05:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on retain this bill
 
05:05:18.070 --> 05:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
then would the clerk please call the
 
05:05:18.080 --> 05:05:21.030 align:start position:0%
then would the clerk please call the
roll

05:05:21.030 --> 05:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative snow had his hand up yes
 
05:05:26.948 --> 05:05:26.958 align:start position:0%
i had my hand up can i just ask i
 
05:05:30.390 --> 05:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
comment i think also this this motion
 
05:05:32.470 --> 05:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
would satisfy the department of
 
05:05:34.150 --> 05:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
corrections which was very concerned
 
05:05:36.788 --> 05:05:36.798 align:start position:0%
about it and i think they would probably
 
05:05:38.230 --> 05:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
be somebody somebody that should be
 
05:05:40.070 --> 05:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
consulted when you look at the bill in
 
05:05:41.590 --> 05:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
more detail because it did cause
 
05:05:44.150 --> 05:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
considerable problems for them
 
05:05:47.590 --> 05:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sure those who will later volunteer
 
05:05:49.590 --> 05:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
over the summer to be part of
 
05:05:51.990 --> 05:05:52.000 align:start position:0%

identification of cannabis strain for
 
05:07:44.390 --> 05:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis i was would have
 
05:07:46.948 --> 05:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
normally asked you the question is it
 
05:07:50.150 --> 05:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
okay with you for us to proceed here but
 
05:07:52.628 --> 05:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
i believe you have been in consultation
 
05:07:52.638 --> 05:07:53.510 align:start position:0%
i believe you have been in consultation
with

05:07:53.510 --> 05:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:07:55.110 --> 05:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
either representative conley or
 
05:07:57.270 --> 05:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
dauntonville or both and you have an
 
05:08:00.150 --> 05:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to satisfy many concerns is
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
05:08:05.430 --> 05:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
that is correct um and i sent it out
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
because it's important you all have it i
 
05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
do presume that they have brought it
 
05:08:11.670 --> 05:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
down to the committee room in addition
 
05:08:11.680 --> 05:08:14.550 align:start position:0%
down to the committee room in addition
um

05:08:14.550 --> 05:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:16.470 --> 05:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
sorry there's my copy of the bill i lost
 
05:08:19.350 --> 05:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
it was on the floor anyway in addition i
 
05:08:21.430 --> 05:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh sent it to all of the committee
 
05:08:23.110 --> 05:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
members by email and i announced that
 
05:08:26.470 --> 05:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
just before lunch so you could find it
 
05:08:29.110 --> 05:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
we'll give the minutes uh representative
 
05:08:32.708 --> 05:08:32.718 align:start position:0%
um just in case it's it's a very few
 
05:08:32.718 --> 05:08:33.670 align:start position:0%
um just in case it's it's a very few
words

05:08:33.670 --> 05:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
words
 
05:08:36.070 --> 05:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
changed and incorrect well bill but
 
05:08:37.590 --> 05:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
still we'll give a few minutes if they
 
05:08:37.600 --> 05:08:41.750 align:start position:0%
still we'll give a few minutes if they
wish

05:08:41.750 --> 05:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:51.270 --> 05:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:11.270 --> 05:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
one of our uh
 
05:09:14.788 --> 05:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
has a bad cause
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i have a visiting dog as well
 
05:09:19.910 --> 05:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:21.670 --> 05:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
i think we're good as long as we can't
 
05:09:23.590 --> 05:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
see them right
 
05:09:29.190 --> 05:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:32.550 --> 05:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
i almost asked representative neil kirk
 
05:09:34.310 --> 05:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
because i've inherited the punster
 
05:09:37.990 --> 05:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
mantle from him if he watched puppy bowl
 
05:09:40.230 --> 05:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
on the animal planet yesterday which was
 
05:09:42.628 --> 05:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
their run-up to the super bowl there
 
05:09:44.868 --> 05:09:44.878 align:start position:0%
must have been four dog puns per minute
 
05:09:46.868 --> 05:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
over three hours i thought of him
 
05:09:46.878 --> 05:09:50.390 align:start position:0%
over three hours i thought of him
throughout

05:09:50.390 --> 05:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:52.470 --> 05:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
because of the puns not the dogs
 
05:09:52.480 --> 05:09:53.990 align:start position:0%
because of the puns not the dogs
right

05:09:53.990 --> 05:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:09:56.868 --> 05:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
okay representative knurk would you uh
 
05:10:01.110 --> 05:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
let us know how your amendment um speaks
 
05:10:01.120 --> 05:10:01.910 align:start position:0%
let us know how your amendment um speaks
to

05:10:01.910 --> 05:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
concerns we raised earlier
 
05:10:06.788 --> 05:10:06.798 align:start position:0%
yes first of all i should say that this
 
05:10:08.470 --> 05:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
is not purely me
 
05:10:10.390 --> 05:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
i did process this with the therapeutic
 
05:10:12.550 --> 05:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board
 
05:10:14.788 --> 05:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
and we went through this bill
 
05:10:17.030 --> 05:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
i also need to speak up for one of the
 
05:10:18.550 --> 05:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
advocacy groups because there were
 
05:10:20.628 --> 05:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
concerns they wanted to make sure it was
 
05:10:22.390 --> 05:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
properly represented
 
05:10:24.070 --> 05:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
and give you just a very quick summary
 
05:10:25.670 --> 05:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
of how it evolved to understand why we
 
05:10:26.948 --> 05:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
made the changes
 
05:10:28.948 --> 05:10:28.958 align:start position:0%
um what it was is advocacy groups are
 
05:10:31.910 --> 05:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
concerned that the uh using the fancy
 
05:10:34.310 --> 05:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
names like hindu kush and stuff
 
05:10:34.320 --> 05:10:35.110 align:start position:0%
names like hindu kush and stuff
were

05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:10:36.948 --> 05:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
names that might sound appealing to kids
 
05:10:38.868 --> 05:10:38.878 align:start position:0%
and it was on the social media
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
the rule was set up that these names
 
05:10:43.350 --> 05:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
could not be used at all on the products
 
05:10:45.990 --> 05:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
on the websites on the social media
 
05:10:48.230 --> 05:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
that was the problem for the patients so
 
05:10:50.390 --> 05:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
this uh the goal of this is to overturn
 
05:10:53.430 --> 05:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
that rule and indeed uh the that
 
05:10:55.750 --> 05:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
particular advocacy group was present at
 
05:10:58.150 --> 05:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
the hearing as well and we processed it
 
05:10:59.670 --> 05:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
through first we wanted to change and if
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
you look at the amendment you will
 
05:11:00.958 --> 05:11:01.830 align:start position:0%
you look at the amendment you will
notice

05:11:01.830 --> 05:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
notice
 
05:11:01.840 --> 05:11:03.110 align:start position:0%
notice
um

05:11:03.110 --> 05:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:04.550 --> 05:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
and it's in bold
 
05:11:06.788 --> 05:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
it says specifying is line sex and the
 
05:11:08.868 --> 05:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
amendment the commercial strain name of
 
05:11:10.708 --> 05:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
the cannabis that was instead of the
 
05:11:12.868 --> 05:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
word the words full name because full
 
05:11:15.350 --> 05:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
name is exceedingly vague chemovar is
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
actually one the proper names but that's
 
05:11:18.948 --> 05:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
a little bit confusing commercial strain
 
05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
name is what is used in the therapeutic
 
05:11:23.430 --> 05:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis rules so it was most consistent
 
05:11:26.070 --> 05:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
so we changed that to that comment the
 
05:11:28.470 --> 05:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
other thing which is uh
 
05:11:30.550 --> 05:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
did not get well sorry there's a second
 
05:11:32.470 --> 05:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
place we change that and that is in line
 
05:11:34.788 --> 05:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
nine to ten it also changes to
 
05:11:37.110 --> 05:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
commercial strain name
 
05:11:39.350 --> 05:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
in line five we continue to keep it with
 
05:11:42.070 --> 05:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
shell that means that the um
 
05:11:45.670 --> 05:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
atc must put on a label on the product
 
05:11:46.948 --> 05:11:46.958 align:start position:0%
so they know what the name of the
 
05:11:48.628 --> 05:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
product is
 
05:11:51.590 --> 05:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
and we did continue with the language
 
05:11:53.110 --> 05:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
that said that that commercial strain
 
05:11:55.430 --> 05:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
name this is line seven and eight will
 
05:11:58.868 --> 05:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
be listed on the public internet website
 
05:12:01.990 --> 05:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
we continue to not allow it on the
 
05:12:03.990 --> 05:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
social media because that is the part
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
that the kids may get directed to with
 
05:12:10.070 --> 05:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
algorithmic uh social media feeds
 
05:12:11.430 --> 05:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
the website
 
05:12:13.510 --> 05:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
allows the
 
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
the patient to be the certifying patient
 
05:12:18.788 --> 05:12:18.798 align:start position:0%
to be able to go to the website find out
 
05:12:20.550 --> 05:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
if that particular atc carries the
 
05:12:22.470 --> 05:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
product that they're looking for and
 
05:12:24.390 --> 05:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
they can also be able to remember the
 
05:12:25.990 --> 05:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
common name instead of a series of
 
05:12:28.550 --> 05:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
letters and numbers so this is vetted by
 
05:12:28.560 --> 05:12:29.430 align:start position:0%
letters and numbers so this is vetted by
the

05:12:29.430 --> 05:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:12:31.030 --> 05:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
05:12:31.040 --> 05:12:32.310 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
board

05:12:32.310 --> 05:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
they were happy with it
 
05:12:36.150 --> 05:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
i can't remember what the vote is but it
 
05:12:38.470 --> 05:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter we we passed it and in
 
05:12:40.310 --> 05:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
addition to that uh the sponsor was
 
05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this too
 
05:12:44.230 --> 05:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
so i guess i would like to move
 
05:12:46.150 --> 05:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
amendment number
 
05:12:46.160 --> 05:12:48.070 align:start position:0%
amendment number
uh

05:12:48.070 --> 05:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:12:49.750 --> 05:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
where is it here amendment number
 
05:12:49.760 --> 05:12:55.270 align:start position:0%
where is it here amendment number

05:13:00.788 --> 05:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:04.390 --> 05:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:07.270 --> 05:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative mckay second
 
05:13:11.670 --> 05:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes yes all right um any
 
05:13:18.310 --> 05:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:20.390 --> 05:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
i just want to have a question
 
05:13:22.390 --> 05:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
shapiro has his hand up
 
05:13:26.070 --> 05:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:28.788 --> 05:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
i have a question for um representative
 
05:13:30.230 --> 05:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
knurk um
 
05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
since these names
 
05:13:35.670 --> 05:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
seem to me to be somewhat homemade at
 
05:13:37.350 --> 05:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
least at one point are there ever
 
05:13:41.350 --> 05:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
competing names for the same strain
 
05:13:43.830 --> 05:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
as far as i understand these are
 
05:13:46.230 --> 05:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
basically say we call them commercial
 
05:13:47.830 --> 05:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
strain names because they are used in
 
05:13:49.990 --> 05:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
the commercial business of therapeutic
 
05:13:52.788 --> 05:13:52.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis and they are uniform throughout
 
05:13:55.670 --> 05:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
the country um they've been for they've
 
05:13:57.510 --> 05:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
been names have adopted for
 
05:14:00.390 --> 05:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh decades for example hindu kush was
 
05:14:01.910 --> 05:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
named that way because apparently that
 
05:14:04.310 --> 05:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
strain was either identified or
 
05:14:06.788 --> 05:14:06.798 align:start position:0%
developed in the hindu kush area that's
 
05:14:09.670 --> 05:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
a geographic area so to be a little like
 
05:14:10.788 --> 05:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:14:13.110 --> 05:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
saying you know some other kind of um
 
05:14:15.590 --> 05:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
name from uh for a for a wine and
 
05:14:17.830 --> 05:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
terrier name for where it comes from
 
05:14:17.840 --> 05:14:18.830 align:start position:0%
terrier name for where it comes from
so

05:14:18.830 --> 05:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:14:22.070 --> 05:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
the yeah these are basically accepted
 
05:14:24.310 --> 05:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
names that are used in commerce and have
 
05:14:26.230 --> 05:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
been for decades but yeah of course
 
05:14:27.430 --> 05:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
they're all made up
 
05:14:29.030 --> 05:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:14:31.030 --> 05:14:31.040 align:start position:0%

you had a question
 
05:14:35.590 --> 05:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you that was really my question
 
05:14:37.990 --> 05:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
was this a terminology that was
 
05:14:38.000 --> 05:14:39.510 align:start position:0%
was this a terminology that was
universal

05:14:39.510 --> 05:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
universal
 
05:14:39.520 --> 05:14:41.590 align:start position:0%
universal
and

05:14:41.590 --> 05:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:14:43.990 --> 05:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
did they ever make up medical sounding
 
05:14:45.910 --> 05:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
names for them
 
05:14:49.030 --> 05:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
i kind of guess not
 
05:14:50.550 --> 05:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
may i answer
 
05:14:51.910 --> 05:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
05:14:53.510 --> 05:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
i have looked at some of the names and
 
05:14:56.470 --> 05:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
that we were directed to leafly.com and
 
05:14:58.390 --> 05:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
kind of i scrolled through some of those
 
05:15:00.708 --> 05:15:00.718 align:start position:0%
i they generally don't seem to have true
 
05:15:03.030 --> 05:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
medical names or medical sounding names
 
05:15:04.628 --> 05:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
they're usually cutesy names you know
 
05:15:07.750 --> 05:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
bubble gum hindu kush that kind of stuff
 
05:15:09.350 --> 05:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
which is why they were considered to be
 
05:15:11.750 --> 05:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps difficult or not good to have on
 
05:15:13.510 --> 05:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
social media feeds with algorithms
 
05:15:14.830 --> 05:15:14.840 align:start position:0%

on the commercial strain name is that

trademark protected or is it something
 
05:15:35.830 --> 05:15:35.840 align:start position:0%

05:16:15.990 --> 05:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
that they're somewhere else

yes representative that's already in
 
05:16:23.670 --> 05:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
rule indeed the purpose of this
 
05:16:26.470 --> 05:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
legislation is to overturn the rule that
 
05:16:28.230 --> 05:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
was promulgated by the therapeutic
 
05:16:30.628 --> 05:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
cannabis program that prohibited the use
 
05:16:32.948 --> 05:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
of the commercial strain name on the
 
05:16:35.830 --> 05:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
package label on the website and on the
 
05:16:38.150 --> 05:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
social media so this would take this
 
05:16:40.230 --> 05:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
would allow back on not allow it but
 
05:16:42.550 --> 05:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
force it back onto the product would
 
05:16:45.030 --> 05:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
allow it on the website but the rule of
 
05:16:47.030 --> 05:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
prohibiting uh the
 
05:16:49.270 --> 05:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
social media would still be standing
 
05:16:50.708 --> 05:16:50.718 align:start position:0%

think that'll be meaningful
 
05:19:50.070 --> 05:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
um on the very day that my um that we
 
05:19:51.590 --> 05:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
had this hearing my wife came home that
 
05:19:53.350 --> 05:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
night from seeing patients as a home
 
05:19:54.948 --> 05:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
care physical therapist
 
05:19:56.550 --> 05:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
and she didn't even know that we had
 
05:19:57.990 --> 05:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
that hearing but she had a story from
 
05:19:58.948 --> 05:19:58.958 align:start position:0%
one of her
 
05:20:01.430 --> 05:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
patients that he had he was suffering
 
05:20:03.110 --> 05:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
from um
 
05:20:03.120 --> 05:20:03.990 align:start position:0%
from um
a

05:20:03.990 --> 05:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:20:06.390 --> 05:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
condition that he was able to at one
 
05:20:08.550 --> 05:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
point obtain a named strain
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
in maine that that helped him so he went
 
05:20:12.470 --> 05:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
ahead and got went through the whole
 
05:20:14.708 --> 05:20:14.718 align:start position:0%
licensing process here in new hampshire
 
05:20:17.110 --> 05:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
and went to uh domestic
 
05:20:18.390 --> 05:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
05:20:22.070 --> 05:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
dover the dover atc was unable to find
 
05:20:24.550 --> 05:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
he tried to request specific name but
 
05:20:26.390 --> 05:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't give it they didn't have
 
05:20:28.390 --> 05:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
that information so he spent a thousand
 
05:20:31.430 --> 05:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
dollars just kind of trying various
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
things that never worked for him and
 
05:20:34.868 --> 05:20:34.878 align:start position:0%
then he never used it
 
05:20:36.628 --> 05:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
and uh so it was a failure for him to
 
05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
even go and get the card so that's just
 
05:20:40.788 --> 05:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
we're fixing that problem right here

05:23:37.430 --> 05:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
which is zero two three eight h and
 
05:23:39.190 --> 05:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
yield the florida representative kenner
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
to speak to that
 
05:23:43.430 --> 05:23:43.440 align:start position:0%

moves otp i'm waiting for a second no no
 
05:23:51.510 --> 05:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
we have to move the amendment first
 
05:23:56.390 --> 05:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:58.708 --> 05:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
second the amendment is representative
 
05:24:03.030 --> 05:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
weber that's marsh yes and weber second
 
05:24:10.070 --> 05:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:11.750 --> 05:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
may i speak to his motion
 
05:24:14.230 --> 05:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
you may speak to the motion on the
 
05:24:16.628 --> 05:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
amendment and what it does
 
05:24:19.350 --> 05:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
yes okay so again we processed this then
 
05:24:20.948 --> 05:24:20.958 align:start position:0%
our therapeutic canvas medical oversight
 
05:24:22.948 --> 05:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
board meeting last wednesday night
 
05:24:25.350 --> 05:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
and if you pull out your amendment which
 
05:24:27.750 --> 05:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
again is zero two three eight
 
05:24:29.750 --> 05:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
and the way this works
 
05:24:31.910 --> 05:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
everything in the bill is the same on
 
05:24:35.110 --> 05:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
page one and the top of page two
 
05:24:37.430 --> 05:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
this bill replaces sections three and
 
05:24:37.440 --> 05:24:38.310 align:start position:0%
this bill replaces sections three and
four

05:24:38.310 --> 05:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
four
 
05:24:40.390 --> 05:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
which begin
 
05:24:44.230 --> 05:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
on the bill begins on page two
 
05:24:47.190 --> 05:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
line four
 
05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
so again if you were trying to follow
 
05:24:50.470 --> 05:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
both the bill and the amendment you look
 
05:24:52.150 --> 05:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
in those two places
 
05:24:53.670 --> 05:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
the concerns
 
05:24:56.708 --> 05:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
uh were a few and by the way at first i
 
05:24:57.670 --> 05:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
should say
 
05:25:00.390 --> 05:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
as i accommodated my testimony on this
 
05:25:02.948 --> 05:25:02.958 align:start position:0%
tcmob had already processed the 1581 the
 
05:25:04.230 --> 05:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
bill from last year no that was a
 
05:25:07.750 --> 05:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:10.070 --> 05:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
and we did jeff that was a good yawn but
 
05:25:12.310 --> 05:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
can you mute yourself
 
05:25:15.190 --> 05:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
please move during yawning
 
05:25:17.350 --> 05:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
it is it is nap time
 
05:25:20.628 --> 05:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
yes anyway but we process we i testified
 
05:25:22.230 --> 05:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
and we had processed last year's bill
 
05:25:24.310 --> 05:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
and we overall agreed with the concept
 
05:25:26.628 --> 05:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
we just had a few little concerns so if
 
05:25:27.910 --> 05:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
we look now
 
05:25:29.430 --> 05:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
on the amendment
 
05:25:32.788 --> 05:25:32.798 align:start position:0%
on so on the amendment it is line
 
05:25:32.798 --> 05:25:34.628 align:start position:0%
on so on the amendment it is line
six

05:25:34.628 --> 05:25:34.638 align:start position:0%
six
 
05:25:37.110 --> 05:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
the language changed before all it said
 
05:25:37.120 --> 05:25:37.990 align:start position:0%
the language changed before all it said
was

05:25:37.990 --> 05:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:25:40.310 --> 05:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
that counseling has been provided to all
 
05:25:43.510 --> 05:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
women we added in by the certifying
 
05:25:43.520 --> 05:25:44.628 align:start position:0%
women we added in by the certifying
provider

05:25:44.628 --> 05:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
provider
 
05:25:46.788 --> 05:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
we did not feel that the atc was
 
05:25:49.270 --> 05:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
qualified to necessarily provide that
 
05:25:51.590 --> 05:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
type of counseling uh they aren't
 
05:25:53.190 --> 05:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
trained for that
 
05:25:55.270 --> 05:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
they are not medical providers it would
 
05:25:57.510 --> 05:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
require them to be profiling people as
 
05:25:59.910 --> 05:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
to gender and whether of child bearing
 
05:25:59.920 --> 05:26:01.270 align:start position:0%
to gender and whether of child bearing
age

05:26:01.270 --> 05:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
age
 
05:26:02.628 --> 05:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
and so we felt it was much more
 
05:26:04.708 --> 05:26:04.718 align:start position:0%
appropriate that the counseling be done
 
05:26:06.550 --> 05:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
by the certifying provider so this just
 
05:26:08.628 --> 05:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
simply puts that in
 
05:26:11.510 --> 05:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
and on the next line
 
05:26:14.230 --> 05:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
the next line when it says on page seven
 
05:26:16.470 --> 05:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
and the parent or guardian of a patient
 
05:26:18.868 --> 05:26:18.878 align:start position:0%
less than age 18 because the original
 
05:26:21.110 --> 05:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
bill just said counseling anybody under
 
05:26:23.830 --> 05:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
25 and children under 18 need to have a
 
05:26:25.830 --> 05:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
parent or guardian present when talking
 
05:26:27.510 --> 05:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
about any intervention
 
05:26:29.110 --> 05:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
so that's the only words that are added
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
in there
 
05:26:32.150 --> 05:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:26:33.670 --> 05:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
the way that this is going to work
 
05:26:35.510 --> 05:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
likely the rules be promulgated there's
 
05:26:36.708 --> 05:26:36.718 align:start position:0%
already a check box that they've
 
05:26:38.550 --> 05:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
counseled on a number of other things
 
05:26:40.310 --> 05:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
this language would be added in so it's
 
05:26:43.910 --> 05:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
not an undue burden move down further
 
05:26:45.750 --> 05:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
05:26:50.310 --> 05:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
to pay to line 14.
 
05:26:52.948 --> 05:26:52.958 align:start position:0%
the objection which i raised at the
 
05:26:55.030 --> 05:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
hearing and mike holt from the
 
05:26:57.830 --> 05:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis also uh echoed and
 
05:27:00.550 --> 05:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
we agreed with in our tcmob meeting is
 
05:27:02.390 --> 05:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
that we should not be codifying what the
 
05:27:04.788 --> 05:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
risks are in statute because statute
 
05:27:06.868 --> 05:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
takes a long time to change medical
 
05:27:09.430 --> 05:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge changes on occasion and so we
 
05:27:11.510 --> 05:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
thought instead of having the words that
 
05:27:13.750 --> 05:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
were there before which is the risks of
 
05:27:15.350 --> 05:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis use during pregnancy and while
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding and it used to say
 
05:27:18.390 --> 05:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
including the risk of low birth weight
 
05:27:20.470 --> 05:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
and developmental issues strike that
 
05:27:23.110 --> 05:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
language and we just say as outlined by
 
05:27:24.548 --> 05:27:24.558 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis medical
 
05:27:27.110 --> 05:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
oversight board i'd already sent you
 
05:27:28.868 --> 05:27:28.878 align:start position:0%
prior to the hearing
 
05:27:30.708 --> 05:27:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh some of the work products we've
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
already developed in preparation to
 
05:27:35.750 --> 05:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
comply with this bill anyway and so we
 
05:27:37.670 --> 05:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
have already outlined those and actually
 
05:27:39.350 --> 05:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
they're identical but this way if
 
05:27:41.830 --> 05:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
something changes new issues come up or
 
05:27:44.310 --> 05:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
issues are proven not to be true
 
05:27:46.548 --> 05:27:46.558 align:start position:0%
that can be altered internally through
 
05:27:48.948 --> 05:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
rules not having to go through statute
 
05:27:52.150 --> 05:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
the next thing though on the next line
 
05:27:55.590 --> 05:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
where it says on line 15 it used to say
 
05:27:57.990 --> 05:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
a warning poster
 
05:27:59.910 --> 05:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
we did not like the word warning we
 
05:28:01.510 --> 05:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
certainly agree that warning is a good
 
05:28:02.628 --> 05:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
thing to use when you're buying
 
05:28:05.590 --> 05:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
cigarettes or alcohol but when you have
 
05:28:05.600 --> 05:28:06.548 align:start position:0%
cigarettes or alcohol but when you have
a

05:28:06.548 --> 05:28:06.558 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:28:08.708 --> 05:28:08.718 align:start position:0%
um an issue here where people are coming
 
05:28:11.750 --> 05:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
in for a therapeutic material that
 
05:28:14.788 --> 05:28:14.798 align:start position:0%
they've been certified to use warning we
 
05:28:16.390 --> 05:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
thought might sound a wee bit harsh and
 
05:28:19.030 --> 05:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
we said an informational poster so it
 
05:28:20.548 --> 05:28:20.558 align:start position:0%
still gives the information it still
 
05:28:22.548 --> 05:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
will be warnings and again i sent you
 
05:28:24.788 --> 05:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
some um ideas of what that could be with
 
05:28:27.190 --> 05:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
the slide deck that i sent um but the
 
05:28:28.708 --> 05:28:28.718 align:start position:0%
point is we wouldn't use the word
 
05:28:30.230 --> 05:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
warning we'd use informational because
 
05:28:32.310 --> 05:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
we're giving information and the reason
 
05:28:35.110 --> 05:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
party for that is there may be a very
 
05:28:36.230 --> 05:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
rare time
 
05:28:38.868 --> 05:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
when it actually is appropriate for a
 
05:28:40.868 --> 05:28:40.878 align:start position:0%
pregnant woman to continue using
 
05:28:43.430 --> 05:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis therapeutically
 
05:28:45.350 --> 05:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
the ruling sorry the wording we have in
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
our work that we've done is that it
 
05:28:48.868 --> 05:28:48.878 align:start position:0%
should not be used
 
05:28:50.628 --> 05:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
if there is any other acceptable
 
05:28:53.030 --> 05:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
alternative so in the rare situation
 
05:28:54.708 --> 05:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
where somebody has let's say a totally
 
05:28:56.948 --> 05:28:56.958 align:start position:0%
out of control ptsd and they will not
 
05:28:58.390 --> 05:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
make it through their pregnancy perhaps
 
05:29:00.708 --> 05:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
you might but that's going to be rare
 
05:29:03.350 --> 05:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
so uh that was the addition we put in
 
05:29:04.948 --> 05:29:04.958 align:start position:0%
there the reason for that informational
 
05:29:06.230 --> 05:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
rather than warning
 
05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
now drop down to uh
 
05:29:11.190 --> 05:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
number nine which is uh
 
05:29:14.070 --> 05:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
line 21 of the amendment
 
05:29:15.910 --> 05:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
same principle here instead of the long
 
05:29:17.430 --> 05:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
laundry list it was there of all the
 
05:29:18.948 --> 05:29:18.958 align:start position:0%
changes that this are in the surgeon
 
05:29:20.470 --> 05:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
general's advisory
 
05:29:22.628 --> 05:29:22.638 align:start position:0%
begin their medical they might change
 
05:29:24.628 --> 05:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
new things may come up things may be
 
05:29:26.230 --> 05:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
proven not to be true
 
05:29:28.230 --> 05:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
we have a default to being in
 
05:29:30.548 --> 05:29:30.558 align:start position:0%
line number 21
 
05:29:32.310 --> 05:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
and 22
 
05:29:34.070 --> 05:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
as outlined by the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:29:35.830 --> 05:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board
 
05:29:39.510 --> 05:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
then if you slide on down to line 23
 
05:29:41.590 --> 05:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
once again it becomes an informational
 
05:29:44.150 --> 05:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
poster rather than a warning poster so
 
05:29:45.830 --> 05:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
those are the only changes simply making
 
05:29:47.910 --> 05:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
sure that we know that the certified
 
05:29:49.910 --> 05:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
provider does the counseling that the
 
05:29:51.110 --> 05:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
parent or guardian is there if you're
 
05:29:53.990 --> 05:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
less than 18 that the tcmob has the
 
05:29:56.628 --> 05:29:56.638 align:start position:0%
ability to be nimble and change these
 
05:29:59.190 --> 05:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
issues as needed and that it's called
 
05:30:00.788 --> 05:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
informational not warning those are all
 
05:30:02.708 --> 05:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
the changes in the amendment any
 
05:30:02.718 --> 05:30:03.750 align:start position:0%
the changes in the amendment any
questions

05:30:03.750 --> 05:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:30:06.070 --> 05:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions for
 
05:30:06.080 --> 05:30:09.270 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions for
representative

05:30:09.270 --> 05:30:09.280 align:start position:0%

you go at my usual breakneck speed and
 
05:30:31.990 --> 05:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
give us a few minutes just to read
 
05:30:34.868 --> 05:30:34.878 align:start position:0%
anything and formulate a question and
 
05:30:37.670 --> 05:30:37.680 align:start position:0%

this bill um just fill it correct me
 
05:30:58.230 --> 05:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
let me know if i'm right in thinking
 
05:31:00.708 --> 05:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
this is going to force say a provider
 
05:31:02.390 --> 05:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
who doesn't agree with the risk
 
05:31:02.400 --> 05:31:03.430 align:start position:0%
who doesn't agree with the risk
assessment

05:31:03.430 --> 05:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
05:31:06.868 --> 05:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
um presented by the surgeon general if
 
05:31:08.788 --> 05:31:08.798 align:start position:0%
they have a differing opinion this will
 
05:31:10.788 --> 05:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
force them to
 
05:31:16.310 --> 05:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:18.708 --> 05:31:18.718 align:start position:0%
may i answer the question mr chairman

yes
 
05:31:20.798 --> 05:31:21.590 align:start position:0%
yes
the

05:31:21.590 --> 05:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:31:24.150 --> 05:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
question is whether counseling has been
 
05:31:27.110 --> 05:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
given it does not ask about the content
 
05:31:30.708 --> 05:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
or require any uh provider to
 
05:31:32.628 --> 05:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
conform with any other provider's
 
05:31:34.868 --> 05:31:34.878 align:start position:0%
opinions as we all know doctors are
 
05:31:37.270 --> 05:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
prone to disagreeing about all sorts of
 
05:31:39.350 --> 05:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
things as representative knurk and i
 
05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
disagree about many things
 
05:31:44.230 --> 05:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
not too often
 
05:31:46.230 --> 05:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
may i answer also
 
05:31:47.430 --> 05:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
05:31:49.030 --> 05:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
we have also in the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:31:50.868 --> 05:31:50.878 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board spent months
 
05:31:53.750 --> 05:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
this last year working on uh developing
 
05:31:56.470 --> 05:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
a program of best clinical practices for
 
05:31:59.030 --> 05:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
certifying providers and those do
 
05:32:02.310 --> 05:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
include counseling um and again because
 
05:32:04.310 --> 05:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
it is a moving target we didn't we don't
 
05:32:06.470 --> 05:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
put that in as saying you must tell them
 
05:32:08.470 --> 05:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
this or this or this but that you really
 
05:32:11.350 --> 05:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
should counsel the patients about all of
 
05:32:13.270 --> 05:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
these issues and that's the adolescence
 
05:32:15.590 --> 05:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the that piece and the
 
05:32:19.510 --> 05:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
pregnant and lactating females as well
 
05:32:21.590 --> 05:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
and representative nelson had his hand
 
05:32:23.910 --> 05:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
up representative nelson
 
05:32:25.590 --> 05:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
yes i have a question i do not have the
 
05:32:28.310 --> 05:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of me but could uh
 
05:32:31.190 --> 05:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative knurk on page two of the
 
05:32:33.350 --> 05:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
original number seven
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
just tell me the changes of that again
 
05:32:37.350 --> 05:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
because i don't have a question for you
 
05:32:38.948 --> 05:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
sure thing okay so you're on the
 
05:32:41.510 --> 05:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
original bill line 13 i presume
 
05:32:44.470 --> 05:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
that is correct okay all it is is the
 
05:32:46.390 --> 05:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
the original it says
 
05:32:47.990 --> 05:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
information about the risks of cannabis
 
05:32:49.750 --> 05:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
use during pregnancy about breastfeeding
 
05:32:51.590 --> 05:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
comma including the risk of low birth
 
05:32:53.910 --> 05:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
weight and developmental issues period
 
05:32:57.190 --> 05:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
we agree with those um that is in our
 
05:32:58.948 --> 05:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
work that we've done but the issue is
 
05:33:00.628 --> 05:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
that medicine can change so we changed
 
05:33:03.990 --> 05:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:06.150 --> 05:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
during pregnancy and well breastfeeding
 
05:33:08.868 --> 05:33:08.878 align:start position:0%
as outlined by the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:33:11.270 --> 05:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board that way we have
 
05:33:13.030 --> 05:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to be nimble to change it
 
05:33:14.788 --> 05:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
next year should something new be need
 
05:33:16.628 --> 05:33:16.638 align:start position:0%
to be added or should something need to
 
05:33:18.708 --> 05:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
be removed many of these findings are
 
05:33:20.628 --> 05:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
relatively new also many of them are
 
05:33:23.350 --> 05:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
based upon recreational use we may find
 
05:33:25.510 --> 05:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
different issues with
 
05:33:27.990 --> 05:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use so the point is we can
 
05:33:29.750 --> 05:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
then be nimble and change it in rules
 
05:33:31.430 --> 05:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
over the course of a year instead of
 
05:33:33.270 --> 05:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
over the course of a couple years
 
05:33:34.628 --> 05:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
and again the next section is just
 
05:33:37.270 --> 05:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
changing from a warning poster to a
 
05:33:40.310 --> 05:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
which is on line 15 of the original bill
 
05:33:43.110 --> 05:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
to an informational poster
 
05:33:44.548 --> 05:33:44.558 align:start position:0%
in our question and i do have a
 
05:33:45.910 --> 05:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
05:33:47.110 --> 05:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
05:33:47.120 --> 05:33:48.708 align:start position:0%
go ahead
representative

05:33:48.708 --> 05:33:48.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:33:51.110 --> 05:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm sorry mr chairman uh
 
05:33:53.350 --> 05:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
informational versus
 
05:33:55.110 --> 05:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
what would that just say i mean would it
 
05:33:55.120 --> 05:33:56.788 align:start position:0%
what would that just say i mean would it
list

05:33:56.788 --> 05:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
list
 
05:33:58.628 --> 05:33:58.638 align:start position:0%
specific warnings because i think of a
 
05:34:00.230 --> 05:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
woman or somebody went in there and they
 
05:34:02.948 --> 05:34:02.958 align:start position:0%
saw very specific things it might
 
05:34:04.470 --> 05:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
trigger something that it could affect
 
05:34:05.990 --> 05:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
your memory
 
05:34:07.670 --> 05:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of other things throughout
 
05:34:08.788 --> 05:34:08.798 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:34:10.470 --> 05:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
rather than just putting you know a
 
05:34:12.070 --> 05:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
generic word in there and you really
 
05:34:13.110 --> 05:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
don't know which one they're talking
 
05:34:13.120 --> 05:34:15.110 align:start position:0%
don't know which one they're talking
about

05:34:15.110 --> 05:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:34:16.548 --> 05:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
may i answer
 
05:34:17.990 --> 05:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead please
 
05:34:19.350 --> 05:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
well the the things that we have been
 
05:34:21.830 --> 05:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
preparing already state things such as
 
05:34:24.470 --> 05:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
there is no known safe amount of
 
05:34:26.230 --> 05:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis to use during pregnancy and
 
05:34:28.310 --> 05:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding that's pretty well agreed
 
05:34:30.708 --> 05:34:30.718 align:start position:0%
upon by uh the surgeon general and
 
05:34:33.750 --> 05:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else um that's why again well
 
05:34:35.910 --> 05:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know actually i must say even even
 
05:34:37.830 --> 05:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
though i was an orthopedic surgeon if i
 
05:34:39.510 --> 05:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
had a patient who was pregnant and i was
 
05:34:41.190 --> 05:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
considering an intervention or we were
 
05:34:42.868 --> 05:34:42.878 align:start position:0%
talking about medicines i still would
 
05:34:45.030 --> 05:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
like to get them off as much as i could
 
05:34:46.788 --> 05:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
and i'm not an obstetrician but i just
 
05:34:48.390 --> 05:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
simply knew that the cleaner that person
 
05:34:49.910 --> 05:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
would be from anything and same with
 
05:34:51.990 --> 05:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol cigarettes but the thing is on
 
05:34:54.070 --> 05:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
occasion there are times when we need to
 
05:34:55.990 --> 05:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
have somebody on a medication because
 
05:34:57.350 --> 05:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's the appropriate thing for them to
 
05:35:00.150 --> 05:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
be able to make it through so
 
05:35:02.548 --> 05:35:02.558 align:start position:0%
um the we just would use factual
 
05:35:02.558 --> 05:35:03.750 align:start position:0%
um the we just would use factual
information

05:35:03.750 --> 05:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:35:05.190 --> 05:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
if you want to if you go back to the
 
05:35:07.110 --> 05:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
email that i sent to before the hearing
 
05:35:09.270 --> 05:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
on this i did have a slide deck and in
 
05:35:11.430 --> 05:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
that there were a couple of uh
 
05:35:13.510 --> 05:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
schematics a couple of diagrams of some
 
05:35:15.750 --> 05:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
of the posters that are used one put out
 
05:35:17.670 --> 05:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
by the cdc one by one of the other
 
05:35:20.390 --> 05:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
states and they are you know eye catchy
 
05:35:22.628 --> 05:35:22.638 align:start position:0%
they have the points about the impact
 
05:35:24.788 --> 05:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
upon the mother the impact upon the
 
05:35:27.030 --> 05:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
fetus um so that you can kind of know
 
05:35:28.390 --> 05:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
what those are
 
05:35:29.830 --> 05:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:35:29.840 --> 05:35:31.350 align:start position:0%

or wrong it sounds like the change in
 
05:37:45.590 --> 05:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
wording makes it better because you're
 
05:37:48.948 --> 05:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
not being restricted to talk to the uh
 
05:37:52.150 --> 05:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
the certified provider is not restricted
 
05:37:53.350 --> 05:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:37:55.830 --> 05:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh points made by the therapeutic
 
05:37:58.548 --> 05:37:58.558 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board
 
05:38:00.868 --> 05:38:00.878 align:start position:0%
that's just that just gives a nice
 
05:38:03.270 --> 05:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
general term in line 14
 
05:38:03.280 --> 05:38:04.310 align:start position:0%
general term in line 14
that

05:38:04.310 --> 05:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:38:05.990 --> 05:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
they can post
 
05:38:08.708 --> 05:38:08.718 align:start position:0%
they can post those things as the as the
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
list changes by the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:38:13.430 --> 05:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
medical board
 
05:38:16.150 --> 05:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
you can post different lists as they as
 
05:38:18.310 --> 05:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
they um evolve
 
05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
so we're not this isn't restrictive
 
05:38:24.310 --> 05:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
language it's actually allowing more
 
05:38:24.320 --> 05:38:26.788 align:start position:0%
language it's actually allowing more
flexibility

05:38:26.788 --> 05:38:26.798 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
05:38:26.798 --> 05:38:27.750 align:start position:0%
flexibility
yeah

05:38:27.750 --> 05:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:38:28.948 --> 05:38:28.958 align:start position:0%
may i answer
 
05:38:28.958 --> 05:38:29.910 align:start position:0%
may i answer
yeah

05:38:29.910 --> 05:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:38:31.750 --> 05:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
yes that is that is the intent of the
 
05:38:34.070 --> 05:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
change is to keep it nimble because that
 
05:38:35.830 --> 05:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
is the job of the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:38:37.750 --> 05:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board is to review the
 
05:38:39.990 --> 05:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
medical issues and we again have spent
 
05:38:42.628 --> 05:38:42.638 align:start position:0%
the entire last year working on provider
 
05:38:44.628 --> 05:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
education pieces
 
05:38:47.750 --> 05:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
with slide decks handouts
 
05:38:49.830 --> 05:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
and we were going to start a road show
 
05:38:51.990 --> 05:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
but that's a little on hold for now and
 
05:38:53.350 --> 05:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
then um
 
05:38:56.150 --> 05:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
having also patient information things
 
05:38:57.910 --> 05:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
that is our job to do it and to review
 
05:39:00.070 --> 05:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
these things and that's why we felt uh
 
05:39:02.470 --> 05:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
and with representative marsha's uh
 
05:39:04.390 --> 05:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
blessings that it would be reasonable to
 
05:39:07.430 --> 05:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
just let the tcmob do that job
 
05:39:13.510 --> 05:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:19.110 --> 05:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:22.070 --> 05:39:22.080 align:start position:0%

i am going to um just
 
05:41:25.990 --> 05:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
say that i i can't support this bill
 
05:41:28.708 --> 05:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
um because i think it's too much
 
05:41:30.030 --> 05:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
meddling in the
 
05:41:32.230 --> 05:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
patient-client relationship
 
05:41:34.628 --> 05:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
we don't mandate by separate rsa

05:41:45.830 --> 05:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:45.840 --> 05:41:47.030 align:start position:0%
 
feedback

05:41:47.030 --> 05:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
05:41:49.670 --> 05:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
and did some research on the benefits of
 
05:41:52.788 --> 05:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
using cannabis for morning sickness
 
05:41:54.470 --> 05:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
during pregnancy
 
05:41:55.670 --> 05:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
05:41:57.510 --> 05:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
that since the
 
05:42:01.270 --> 05:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
the science is pretty um
 
05:42:02.470 --> 05:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think that there's a
 
05:42:05.430 --> 05:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
robust body of literature
 
05:42:08.150 --> 05:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
on on pregnancy and cannabis use i know
 
05:42:10.390 --> 05:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
there are a few studies but
 
05:42:13.350 --> 05:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
um i don't think it's
 
05:42:16.150 --> 05:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable to make a separate rsa to
 
05:42:20.070 --> 05:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
require this counseling
 
05:42:21.990 --> 05:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
i won't be supporting it
 
05:42:25.830 --> 05:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
would either representative marshall
 
05:42:28.708 --> 05:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
i would like to please did that
 
05:42:28.718 --> 05:42:29.750 align:start position:0%
i would like to please did that

representative

05:42:31.030 --> 05:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:42:32.390 --> 05:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's the one
 
05:42:35.350 --> 05:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
okay um yeah the difficulty though here
 
05:42:37.670 --> 05:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
and this always makes it quite difficult
 
05:42:39.750 --> 05:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
is to remember that cannabis continues
 
05:42:41.590 --> 05:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
to be a schedule one
 
05:42:43.590 --> 05:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
material which is why we do not talk
 
05:42:46.150 --> 05:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
about prescribing it and we have to have
 
05:42:47.990 --> 05:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
a whole set of rules about how we run
 
05:42:49.510 --> 05:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
this program that are so vastly
 
05:42:51.350 --> 05:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
different than how we do medicine in
 
05:42:51.360 --> 05:42:52.390 align:start position:0%
different than how we do medicine in
general

05:42:52.390 --> 05:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
general
 
05:42:52.400 --> 05:42:53.510 align:start position:0%
general
because

05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:42:55.590 --> 05:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
physicians uh cannot well sorry
 
05:42:57.430 --> 05:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
providers because other people can write
 
05:42:57.440 --> 05:42:58.230 align:start position:0%
providers because other people can write
too

05:42:58.230 --> 05:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
too
 
05:42:59.350 --> 05:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
are not
 
05:43:01.190 --> 05:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
really we don't have a proper standard
 
05:43:03.270 --> 05:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
of care we don't have an fda rulings on
 
05:43:05.990 --> 05:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
these things so we have to work in a in
 
05:43:07.990 --> 05:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
a fashion that combines
 
05:43:10.788 --> 05:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
a currently federally illegal material
 
05:43:11.990 --> 05:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
with something that the state is
 
05:43:14.390 --> 05:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
sanctioning to be used therapeutically
 
05:43:17.990 --> 05:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
and well you there are points about
 
05:43:20.230 --> 05:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh therapeutic cannabis may be helpful
 
05:43:22.310 --> 05:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
for morning sickness the point of the
 
05:43:25.750 --> 05:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
matter is so was thalidomide
 
05:43:29.510 --> 05:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and so we have to remember that we
 
05:43:32.390 --> 05:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
all medicines or all materials have
 
05:43:34.868 --> 05:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
goods and bads to them and a patient
 
05:43:37.030 --> 05:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
should be informed as to the importance
 
05:43:39.350 --> 05:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
of the risks and the benefits
 
05:43:41.350 --> 05:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
and i agree with you and i commented
 
05:43:42.708 --> 05:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
before we don't have a lot of data from
 
05:43:45.190 --> 05:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
the recreational sorry from the
 
05:43:47.670 --> 05:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis side it comes from
 
05:43:49.670 --> 05:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
the recreational side currently and
 
05:43:51.830 --> 05:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's why we're defaulting to tcmob so
 
05:43:53.990 --> 05:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
we can take out some of these warnings
 
05:43:56.390 --> 05:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
if it turns out that we have new data
 
05:43:58.628 --> 05:43:58.638 align:start position:0%
that says hey it isn't so bad if it's
 
05:44:00.390 --> 05:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
under a certain amount of control
 
05:44:02.548 --> 05:44:02.558 align:start position:0%
therapeutically so that's the idea of
 
05:44:05.030 --> 05:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
making this flexible so it can be
 
05:44:07.190 --> 05:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
changed but the current information
 
05:44:09.670 --> 05:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
would support being highly cautious in
 
05:44:13.990 --> 05:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:16.390 --> 05:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i saw representative kohful
 
05:44:18.390 --> 05:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
put up a hand a while ago but it's down
 
05:44:20.628 --> 05:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
again so i don't know if he is still
 
05:44:22.470 --> 05:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
intending to talk or not it was not my
 
05:44:24.230 --> 05:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
intention to put my hand down i'm not
 
05:44:26.070 --> 05:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
sure how that happened before i call on
 
05:44:27.590 --> 05:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
you representative do you have a
 
05:44:30.310 --> 05:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative cushman yeah my
 
05:44:30.320 --> 05:44:31.590 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative cushman yeah my
um

05:44:31.590 --> 05:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:34.150 --> 05:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
my statement is that
 
05:44:36.548 --> 05:44:36.558 align:start position:0%
i well i understand that the
 
05:44:38.868 --> 05:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
regulation mechanism is different and
 
05:44:40.948 --> 05:44:40.958 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a roundabout way
 
05:44:42.788 --> 05:44:42.798 align:start position:0%
it's and i understand there's some
 
05:44:44.548 --> 05:44:44.558 align:start position:0%
wiggle room now with this oversight
 
05:44:46.708 --> 05:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
board even if there is an oversight
 
05:44:48.868 --> 05:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
board and standards of practice
 
05:44:51.430 --> 05:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
you know established by that um it's
 
05:44:52.948 --> 05:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
still the
 
05:44:55.910 --> 05:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
the provider's prerogative in my view to
 
05:44:57.590 --> 05:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
provide informed consent and their
 
05:45:00.150 --> 05:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility under the law anyway
 
05:45:03.110 --> 05:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
um so they will do that with their own
 
05:45:06.948 --> 05:45:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:10.150 --> 05:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
may i respond though hey representative
 
05:45:11.990 --> 05:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
again as representative mark said this
 
05:45:14.470 --> 05:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
bill does not state what they need to
 
05:45:15.750 --> 05:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
say just that they have given the
 
05:45:17.910 --> 05:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
counseling and as representative marsh
 
05:45:20.708 --> 05:45:20.718 align:start position:0%
pointed out many physicians we often do
 
05:45:22.548 --> 05:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
not agree about medical issues
 
05:45:24.070 --> 05:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
and so if that particular physician
 
05:45:26.390 --> 05:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
wishes to tell them that it is perfectly
 
05:45:26.400 --> 05:45:27.190 align:start position:0%
wishes to tell them that it is perfectly
fine

05:45:27.190 --> 05:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
fine
 
05:45:29.030 --> 05:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
they can they still check the box if
 
05:45:30.788 --> 05:45:30.798 align:start position:0%
they've counseled the patient i would
 
05:45:32.390 --> 05:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
not personally agree with that
 
05:45:34.390 --> 05:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
counseling but there's nothing that says
 
05:45:37.030 --> 05:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
what that certifying provider has to say
 
05:45:39.350 --> 05:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
to the patient
 
05:45:41.590 --> 05:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i have my hand up as well
 
05:45:43.830 --> 05:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative marsh
 
05:45:46.150 --> 05:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
yes i thank you i would like to point
 
05:45:47.670 --> 05:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
out to the committee that
 
05:45:49.830 --> 05:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
most medications like zofran which was
 
05:45:52.470 --> 05:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
given as an example are approved by the
 
05:45:54.310 --> 05:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
food and drug administration and the
 
05:45:56.310 --> 05:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
food and drug administration has warning
 
05:45:58.948 --> 05:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
labels and package inserts included with
 
05:46:00.628 --> 05:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
these products before they are
 
05:46:03.030 --> 05:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
distributed to consumers so there is a
 
05:46:05.110 --> 05:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism whereby the information that
 
05:46:07.510 --> 05:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
consumers need is conveyed to the
 
05:46:10.708 --> 05:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
consumers in the case of cannabis it has
 
05:46:12.868 --> 05:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
not gone through that process
 
05:46:14.868 --> 05:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
the legislature has determined that
 
05:46:17.830 --> 05:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis is to be provided as a drug to
 
05:46:19.190 --> 05:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
people in the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:46:21.350 --> 05:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
program and therefore becomes incumbent
 
05:46:24.070 --> 05:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
upon the legislature to make sure that
 
05:46:25.990 --> 05:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
the people who are getting this drug get
 
05:46:27.670 --> 05:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
the information they need to make an
 
05:46:30.470 --> 05:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
informed decision just as the fda has
 
05:46:32.868 --> 05:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
done on a national level for
 
05:46:35.670 --> 05:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
other prescription drugs like zofran so
 
05:46:37.670 --> 05:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
i think in this case we are just doing
 
05:46:39.830 --> 05:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
the second half of our duty we've made
 
05:46:42.470 --> 05:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
this drug available to the public and we
 
05:46:44.230 --> 05:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
have a duty then to make sure that they
 
05:46:46.470 --> 05:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
get the information to make an informed
 
05:46:49.350 --> 05:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
decision uh so thank you very much
 
05:46:52.070 --> 05:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative cofolt
 
05:46:54.788 --> 05:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you mr chairman um i am i
 
05:46:56.310 --> 05:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
have to say i'm i'm kind of i've kind of
 
05:46:58.470 --> 05:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
been on the fence on this one i i think
 
05:47:01.300 --> 05:47:01.310 align:start position:0%
it makes good sense to uh to to
 
05:47:01.310 --> 05:47:03.830 align:start position:0%
it makes good sense to uh to to
[Music]

05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:47:06.390 --> 05:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
inform people about risks um at the same
 
05:47:08.390 --> 05:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
time i also
 
05:47:10.470 --> 05:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
am concerned about codifying something
 
05:47:12.310 --> 05:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
in the law which i think is is
 
05:47:12.320 --> 05:47:13.830 align:start position:0%
in the law which i think is is
ultimately

05:47:13.830 --> 05:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
05:47:15.750 --> 05:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
best handled elsewhere
 
05:47:18.948 --> 05:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
and i recall if i recall correctly
 
05:47:21.270 --> 05:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
somebody from dhhs had stated that it
 
05:47:23.110 --> 05:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
was the department's intention to
 
05:47:23.120 --> 05:47:24.310 align:start position:0%
was the department's intention to
produce

05:47:24.310 --> 05:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
produce
 
05:47:26.830 --> 05:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
similar materials
 
05:47:30.150 --> 05:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
so you know i as far as the the
 
05:47:31.670 --> 05:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
availability of the materials are
 
05:47:33.510 --> 05:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
concerned i feel like
 
05:47:36.310 --> 05:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
codifying this in legislation is
 
05:47:36.320 --> 05:47:37.430 align:start position:0%
codifying this in legislation is
um

05:47:37.430 --> 05:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:39.990 --> 05:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
is probably not necessary
 
05:47:41.750 --> 05:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and i am a little bit concerned
 
05:47:43.030 --> 05:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
about the
 
05:47:45.670 --> 05:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
um the state of the of the
 
05:47:45.680 --> 05:47:46.708 align:start position:0%
um the state of the of the
uh

05:47:46.708 --> 05:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:47:48.150 --> 05:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
relationship between the physician and
 
05:47:50.788 --> 05:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
the patient so uh for that reason i am
 
05:47:56.470 --> 05:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:58.868 --> 05:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:48:05.750 --> 05:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:06.708 --> 05:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
give it
 
05:48:14.708 --> 05:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
may i actually answer back to
 
05:48:19.750 --> 05:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative cole fault for a moment
 
05:48:22.390 --> 05:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
yes you get in under my 20 seconds do it
 
05:48:23.990 --> 05:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay and actually what i'm going to say
 
05:48:25.670 --> 05:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
is very much what representative marsh
 
05:48:27.830 --> 05:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
said when he presented this bill
 
05:48:27.840 --> 05:48:29.350 align:start position:0%
said when he presented this bill
sometimes

05:48:29.350 --> 05:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
05:48:31.430 --> 05:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
legislation helps to make sure something
 
05:48:32.948 --> 05:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
really happens
 
05:48:34.868 --> 05:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
and indeed um
 
05:48:36.548 --> 05:48:36.558 align:start position:0%
you know we
 
05:48:38.548 --> 05:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
are on board with this and are working
 
05:48:41.030 --> 05:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
on it but it is helpful sometimes to
 
05:48:45.670 --> 05:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:46.868 --> 05:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
and let me
 
05:48:49.030 --> 05:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
underscore that in that
 
05:48:51.670 --> 05:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'm involved in something with one of
 
05:48:54.628 --> 05:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
the departments where they had said that
 
05:48:56.470 --> 05:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
they were going to do something
 
05:49:00.230 --> 05:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
and they haven't done it in a few years
 
05:49:03.190 --> 05:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
and so now there will be a bill that i
 
05:49:04.708 --> 05:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
will be part of
 
05:49:06.470 --> 05:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
for the same reason i'm sure they just
 
05:49:09.750 --> 05:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
forgot having it in law will help them
 
05:49:09.760 --> 05:49:13.910 align:start position:0%
forgot having it in law will help them
remember

05:49:13.910 --> 05:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:17.430 --> 05:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:20.708 --> 05:49:20.718 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands mr chair the bill
 
05:49:24.470 --> 05:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
is house bill 163 fn
 
05:49:26.070 --> 05:49:26.080 align:start position:0%

05:49:29.350 --> 05:49:29.360 align:start position:0%

one amongst representatives nelson
 
05:51:35.030 --> 05:51:35.040 align:start position:0%

05:51:41.110 --> 05:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not speaking once it is not
 
05:51:43.750 --> 05:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
necessary but you may do it
 
05:51:45.510 --> 05:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
and let us know why
 
05:51:48.150 --> 05:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
all right representative cushman writes
 
05:51:59.990 --> 05:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:02.070 --> 05:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
the minority report tells us why they
 
05:52:04.948 --> 05:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
are against the bill
 
05:52:07.750 --> 05:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
and the majority report will take into
 
05:52:07.760 --> 05:52:08.548 align:start position:0%
and the majority report will take into
account

05:52:08.548 --> 05:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
account
 
05:52:10.310 --> 05:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
what the amendment
 
05:52:10.320 --> 05:52:11.910 align:start position:0%
what the amendment
does

05:52:11.910 --> 05:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:52:11.920 --> 05:52:13.190 align:start position:0%
does
but

05:52:13.190 --> 05:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:52:15.910 --> 05:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i actually have a
 
05:52:17.910 --> 05:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
piece that i wrote some time ago if i
 
05:52:21.030 --> 05:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
can find it about how to write blurbs
 
05:52:22.628 --> 05:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
which we don't call blurbs anymore we
 
05:52:24.708 --> 05:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
just call committee reports but if you
 
05:52:26.150 --> 05:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
would like me to send that around i
 
05:52:28.070 --> 05:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
would be glad to do so i'll make a copy
 
05:52:29.670 --> 05:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
of that for myself thank you and i'm
 
05:52:32.548 --> 05:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
sure my colleagues would as well
 
05:52:34.708 --> 05:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
now let me ask you representative weber
 
05:52:36.390 --> 05:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
in the minority report
 
05:52:39.670 --> 05:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
as i understand it it is simply saying
 
05:52:39.680 --> 05:52:40.628 align:start position:0%
as i understand it it is simply saying
why

05:52:40.628 --> 05:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:52:43.590 --> 05:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
um they believe that this is not a good
 
05:52:45.270 --> 05:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
bill to pass
 
05:52:47.430 --> 05:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
they don't recommend any other
 
05:52:50.310 --> 05:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
motion no the minority also does
 
05:52:52.628 --> 05:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
actually select a different motion in
 
05:52:54.628 --> 05:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
this case it would be an expedient to
 
05:52:57.190 --> 05:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
legislate i think because
 
05:52:59.190 --> 05:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh they want it
 
05:53:01.830 --> 05:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
they simply don't agree with the bill
 
05:53:03.670 --> 05:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
they could say that they wish the
 
05:53:05.990 --> 05:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee had retained it
 
05:53:07.430 --> 05:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
although maybe you can't do that one
 
05:53:09.510 --> 05:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
because i don't think the house can tell
 
05:53:11.670 --> 05:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
us to retain but
 
05:53:13.590 --> 05:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
we often have them that
 
05:53:15.510 --> 05:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
one report has ought to pass with an
 
05:53:17.430 --> 05:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and another report is ought to
 
05:53:19.350 --> 05:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
pass with a different amendment
 
05:53:21.030 --> 05:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
well i learned something i think it's
 
05:53:22.948 --> 05:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
relatively simple it just they don't
 
05:53:24.948 --> 05:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
want the the people in the minority i
 
05:53:26.788 --> 05:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
don't think wanted to pass at all so
 
05:53:30.070 --> 05:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
that's itl for the recommendation
 
05:53:31.590 --> 05:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i learned something from my
 
05:53:31.600 --> 05:53:33.510 align:start position:0%
thank you i learned something from my
questions

05:53:33.510 --> 05:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:53:36.868 --> 05:53:36.878 align:start position:0%
okay good now under uh 350 which is
 
05:53:40.390 --> 05:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative atkins um i don't have a

05:53:48.788 --> 05:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
350 350.
 
05:53:51.030 --> 05:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think i've seen an amendment
 
05:53:56.390 --> 05:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:57.910 --> 05:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative acton is there an
 
05:53:57.920 --> 05:53:59.110 align:start position:0%

then
 
05:54:12.390 --> 05:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:15.670 --> 05:54:15.680 align:start position:0%

05:54:19.670 --> 05:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh can i do that mr chair
 
05:54:21.750 --> 05:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
yes yeah that's usually
 
05:54:23.990 --> 05:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
a custom is to give the bill sponsor
 
05:54:25.670 --> 05:54:25.680 align:start position:0%

second
 
05:54:42.470 --> 05:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
and representative snow second set and
 
05:54:44.788 --> 05:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
now we may discuss it
 
05:54:46.470 --> 05:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
05:54:49.910 --> 05:54:49.920 align:start position:0%

okay so well you know we went through
 
05:54:52.000 --> 05:54:53.110 align:start position:0%
okay so well you know we went through
this

05:54:53.110 --> 05:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:54:55.510 --> 05:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
pretty comprehensively and we've done it
 
05:54:57.750 --> 05:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
a number of years in a row here
 
05:54:59.190 --> 05:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
so i don't think we need to spend too
 
05:55:01.350 --> 05:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
much time but i will certainly take any
 
05:55:02.948 --> 05:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
questions um just
 
05:55:04.788 --> 05:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that um
 
05:55:06.788 --> 05:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
we really did spend
 
05:55:08.948 --> 05:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of time going line by line through
 
05:55:10.708 --> 05:55:10.718 align:start position:0%
this we made a lot of amendments last
 
05:55:10.718 --> 05:55:12.150 align:start position:0%
this we made a lot of amendments last
year

05:55:12.150 --> 05:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:55:13.830 --> 05:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
and we did a lot of subcommittee work
 
05:55:17.350 --> 05:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
that really went well a lot of input so
 
05:55:19.350 --> 05:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
i think this is ready to go and um you
 
05:55:21.270 --> 05:55:21.280 align:start position:0%

it's a
 
05:56:26.310 --> 05:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
problem for a lot of people especially
 
05:56:26.320 --> 05:56:28.390 align:start position:0%
problem for a lot of people especially
adolescents

05:56:28.390 --> 05:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
adolescents
 
05:56:30.708 --> 05:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
i just think that prohibition of
 
05:56:33.110 --> 05:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
marijuana has been a disaster
 
05:56:34.708 --> 05:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
in so many ways
 
05:56:36.788 --> 05:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
and that this is a vestige of
 
05:56:36.798 --> 05:56:38.150 align:start position:0%
and that this is a vestige of
prohibition

05:56:38.150 --> 05:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
prohibition
 
05:56:38.160 --> 05:56:39.030 align:start position:0%
prohibition
and

05:56:39.030 --> 05:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:56:41.430 --> 05:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
if people are concerned about diversion
 
05:56:43.510 --> 05:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
of this grown
 
05:56:43.520 --> 05:56:46.708 align:start position:0%
of this grown
cannabis

05:56:46.708 --> 05:56:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:49.430 --> 05:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
i think cannabis that is bought in a
 
05:56:52.470 --> 05:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
in a dispensary can also be diverted and
 
05:56:54.788 --> 05:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
i think cannabis is so
 
05:56:57.270 --> 05:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
readily available to people
 
05:56:58.868 --> 05:56:58.878 align:start position:0%
that to me it's not an issue i
 
05:57:00.868 --> 05:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support this and i think
 
05:57:02.628 --> 05:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
people should be allowed to be able to
 
05:57:03.990 --> 05:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
grow their own
 
05:57:06.310 --> 05:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis because it's cheaper because
 
05:57:09.990 --> 05:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:13.750 --> 05:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
because they have more choice and um
 
05:57:17.190 --> 05:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
because it's about self-reliance so i
 
05:57:20.548 --> 05:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support this bill
 
05:57:21.670 --> 05:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:57:23.590 --> 05:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
i have representative merchant with a
 
05:57:25.830 --> 05:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
hand up and i have representative kelsey
 
05:57:27.750 --> 05:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
with a hand up
 
05:57:29.670 --> 05:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
representing thank you
 
05:57:31.590 --> 05:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and also
 
05:57:34.470 --> 05:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's i'm trying to go through my notes
 
05:57:36.470 --> 05:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
and i remember someone making a comment
 
05:57:36.480 --> 05:57:37.510 align:start position:0%
and i remember someone making a comment
that

05:57:37.510 --> 05:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:57:41.270 --> 05:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's not inexpensive to buy cannabis um
 
05:57:42.868 --> 05:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
and for somebody who's
 
05:57:44.788 --> 05:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
on it who needs it particularly chemo
 
05:57:44.798 --> 05:57:45.750 align:start position:0%
on it who needs it particularly chemo
patients

05:57:45.750 --> 05:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
patients
 
05:57:47.830 --> 05:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
it can be a cost burden
 
05:57:49.350 --> 05:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
so i was trying to go through my notes i
 
05:57:50.628 --> 05:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
think i had somewhere around two or
 
05:57:52.390 --> 05:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
three hundred dollars a month that would
 
05:57:55.910 --> 05:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
cost them to go to a dispensary what i'm
 
05:57:58.310 --> 05:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
trying to get to is this i think
 
05:58:00.390 --> 05:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
minimizes the cost barrier to patients
 
05:58:02.230 --> 05:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
getting their cannabis
 
05:58:04.150 --> 05:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
to make the medical treatment that they
 
05:58:06.868 --> 05:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
need particularly people with oncology
 
05:58:09.670 --> 05:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh and the like so just want to clarify
 
05:58:11.750 --> 05:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
my notes that it's like 300 per month i
 
05:58:13.110 --> 05:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
believe is what they had is that correct
 
05:58:15.110 --> 05:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
does anyone know
 
05:58:17.110 --> 05:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i can take that one
 
05:58:18.948 --> 05:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
the the cost of
 
05:58:21.590 --> 05:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
one ounce of flour the the typical
 
05:58:25.270 --> 05:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
bag of cannabis is uh about in in the
 
05:58:27.750 --> 05:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
range of 360 dollars
 
05:58:30.390 --> 05:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
so it depends on on your needs uh some
 
05:58:32.070 --> 05:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
people could use that uh could go
 
05:58:33.270 --> 05:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
through that every
 
05:58:35.910 --> 05:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh two weeks if and if you're making
 
05:58:38.708 --> 05:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
edibles maybe even more so so the cost
 
05:58:38.718 --> 05:58:39.510 align:start position:0%
edibles maybe even more so so the cost
could

05:58:39.510 --> 05:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:58:41.510 --> 05:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
be double that up and upwards of a
 
05:58:43.510 --> 05:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
05:58:46.548 --> 05:58:46.558 align:start position:0%
most people who are just using for
 
05:58:48.788 --> 05:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
um pain and so forth would be less than
 
05:58:51.350 --> 05:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
that so uh but but it is considerable
 
05:58:53.670 --> 05:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
05:58:55.990 --> 05:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
in the to the tune of uh two to three
 
05:58:56.000 --> 05:58:57.270 align:start position:0%
in the to the tune of uh two to three
hundred

05:58:57.270 --> 05:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
05:58:59.030 --> 05:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
minimum i would say for
 
05:59:05.910 --> 05:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:07.910 --> 05:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative kelsey had her hand up
 
05:59:10.390 --> 05:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
and i believe that representative canark
 
05:59:12.150 --> 05:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
is now asking to speak after
 
05:59:14.548 --> 05:59:14.558 align:start position:0%
representative kelsey representative
 
05:59:14.558 --> 05:59:16.150 align:start position:0%
representative kelsey representative
kelsey

05:59:16.150 --> 05:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
kelsey
 
05:59:18.708 --> 05:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i guess my
 
05:59:21.430 --> 05:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
concern with this is uh being a big
 
05:59:24.150 --> 05:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
proponent of the second amendment um
 
05:59:27.670 --> 05:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
is this not going to hurt somebody's
 
05:59:30.948 --> 05:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
second amendment rights if the atf
 
05:59:33.190 --> 05:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
were to find out that somebody was
 
05:59:33.200 --> 05:59:34.628 align:start position:0%
were to find out that somebody was
cultivating

05:59:34.628 --> 05:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
cultivating
 
05:59:36.470 --> 05:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
therapeutic marijuana
 
05:59:39.190 --> 05:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
is it still the stance of the atf to
 
05:59:40.628 --> 05:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
then come in
 
05:59:42.708 --> 05:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
and be able to
 
05:59:49.990 --> 05:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:51.510 --> 05:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
a good question
 
05:59:53.350 --> 05:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative canark would you answer
 
05:59:55.510 --> 05:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
that care to answer that
 
05:59:55.520 --> 05:59:56.708 align:start position:0%
that care to answer that
actually

05:59:56.708 --> 05:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:59:59.350 --> 05:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
i'll give what my memory is but i think
 
06:00:01.670 --> 06:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative acton may know if
 
06:00:03.910 --> 06:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
i recall even just
 
06:00:05.750 --> 06:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
being a certified
 
06:00:05.760 --> 06:00:06.708 align:start position:0%
being a certified
patient

06:00:06.708 --> 06:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
patient
 
06:00:08.628 --> 06:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
has the same risk isn't that correct to
 
06:00:10.628 --> 06:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
06:00:12.230 --> 06:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
yes it does because you have to fill out
 
06:00:12.240 --> 06:00:13.110 align:start position:0%
yes it does because you have to fill out
the

06:00:13.110 --> 06:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:00:16.868 --> 06:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
on the form to purchase a firearm
 
06:00:16.878 --> 06:00:17.590 align:start position:0%
on the form to purchase a firearm
you

06:00:17.590 --> 06:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:00:20.628 --> 06:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
it specifically uh states it it calls
 
06:00:23.830 --> 06:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
out cannabis in in medical form
 
06:00:25.910 --> 06:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
and uh so there is a prohibition on that
 
06:00:27.510 --> 06:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
at the federal level
 
06:00:30.070 --> 06:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
and um now the
 
06:00:32.470 --> 06:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
so you get into that gray area of is it
 
06:00:34.390 --> 06:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
enforced or not right now it's not being
 
06:00:34.400 --> 06:00:35.670 align:start position:0%
enforced or not right now it's not being
enforced

06:00:35.670 --> 06:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
06:00:37.670 --> 06:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh so we look to the future and that's
 
06:00:39.910 --> 06:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
the problem with this dubious status we
 
06:00:42.070 --> 06:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
have of states approving it
 
06:00:43.990 --> 06:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
in the status it has at the federal
 
06:00:46.150 --> 06:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
level hopefully that'll change it i
 
06:00:47.910 --> 06:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
don't think there'd be crackdown but who
 
06:00:49.190 --> 06:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
even knows
 
06:00:50.948 --> 06:00:50.958 align:start position:0%
follow up so yeah i mean
 
06:00:53.030 --> 06:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh so representative kelsey yes that is
 
06:00:55.110 --> 06:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
a valid concern
 
06:00:57.750 --> 06:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
yes follow up please
 
06:01:01.510 --> 06:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay so um then people would know
 
06:01:03.190 --> 06:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
that they were putting their second
 
06:01:04.948 --> 06:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
amendment rights
 
06:01:07.190 --> 06:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
they were risking them by doing this
 
06:01:11.990 --> 06:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:13.430 --> 06:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
yes it's something that that the
 
06:01:15.030 --> 06:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
community talks about
 
06:01:19.190 --> 06:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:20.590 --> 06:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:01:20.600 --> 06:01:22.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
[Music]

06:01:22.070 --> 06:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:01:24.230 --> 06:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative kenner did
 
06:01:25.990 --> 06:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak again i have a note
 
06:01:28.390 --> 06:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
here that you do yes uh yes i'll
 
06:01:29.830 --> 06:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
actually finish that last and the point
 
06:01:31.910 --> 06:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
is that you've run that same risk just
 
06:01:33.510 --> 06:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
being a certified patient whether you're
 
06:01:35.590 --> 06:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
growing or not growing so that risk is
 
06:01:37.190 --> 06:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
already there growing will not increase
 
06:01:39.190 --> 06:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
it um the
 
06:01:41.030 --> 06:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
point i wanted to make though is the
 
06:01:43.270 --> 06:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
access issue is not just a financial
 
06:01:45.110 --> 06:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
access issue that is a very important
 
06:01:46.230 --> 06:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
point that representative merchant
 
06:01:48.470 --> 06:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
brought up but it's also a geographical
 
06:01:49.750 --> 06:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
access issue
 
06:01:52.708 --> 06:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
because the dispensaries are rather
 
06:01:52.718 --> 06:01:53.830 align:start position:0%
because the dispensaries are rather
scattered

06:01:53.830 --> 06:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
scattered
 
06:01:56.070 --> 06:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
and if you are in the north country you
 
06:01:57.830 --> 06:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
may have a very long drive to your
 
06:02:00.788 --> 06:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
closest dispensary including those who
 
06:02:02.150 --> 06:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
are in the southwest corner of the state
 
06:02:04.628 --> 06:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
who may need to be crossing state lines
 
06:02:07.590 --> 06:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh which is a problem as well uh so the
 
06:02:10.708 --> 06:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
issue is it allows a geographic ease to
 
06:02:12.868 --> 06:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
be able to grow and process your own
 
06:02:12.878 --> 06:02:14.070 align:start position:0%
be able to grow and process your own
material

and um
 
06:02:44.230 --> 06:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
it's been touched on a little bit and
 
06:02:47.190 --> 06:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
and the pricing is really what drove it
 
06:02:48.788 --> 06:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
home for me
 
06:02:51.590 --> 06:02:51.600 align:start position:0%

several people already
 
06:02:55.670 --> 06:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
the numbers that i have gathered it's be
 
06:03:00.070 --> 06:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
350 for an ounce in a dispensary 150 to
 
06:03:02.628 --> 06:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
200 on the black market
 
06:03:04.548 --> 06:03:04.558 align:start position:0%
and about 25
 
06:03:07.430 --> 06:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
if you grow your own um
 
06:03:09.670 --> 06:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
so i know people with a medical
 
06:03:12.788 --> 06:03:12.798 align:start position:0%
marijuana card who are already doing one
 
06:03:14.628 --> 06:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
of the two options
 
06:03:17.270 --> 06:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
that aren't technically not allowed yet
 
06:03:19.110 --> 06:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:03:21.270 --> 06:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to i'm going in favor of this
 
06:03:21.280 --> 06:03:25.750 align:start position:0%
i'm going to i'm going in favor of this
bill

06:03:25.750 --> 06:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:28.390 --> 06:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:03:30.310 --> 06:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
a representative nutter upham has her
 
06:03:32.868 --> 06:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
hand up representative
 
06:03:36.230 --> 06:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you i remember
 
06:03:40.070 --> 06:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh distinctly the testimony from people
 
06:03:41.990 --> 06:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh last year
 
06:03:44.628 --> 06:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
um that said you can only when they go
 
06:03:47.110 --> 06:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
to the dispensary to get their uh
 
06:03:49.110 --> 06:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
prescription they're only allowed 10
 
06:03:52.310 --> 06:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
days worth of product
 
06:03:54.548 --> 06:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
which meant if you lived an hour and a
 
06:03:57.190 --> 06:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
half from the dispensary you might have
 
06:04:00.470 --> 06:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
to travel to that dispensary three times
 
06:04:03.110 --> 06:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
in one month which there were some of
 
06:04:05.030 --> 06:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
the people that testified in front of
 
06:04:07.990 --> 06:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
our committee that um were in pain it
 
06:04:10.070 --> 06:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
was it was very difficult for them to
 
06:04:11.910 --> 06:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
travel at all
 
06:04:13.110 --> 06:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
and that would mean they would have to
 
06:04:14.948 --> 06:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
make you know six trips back and forth
 
06:04:17.430 --> 06:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
back and forth so i just wanted to add
 
06:04:19.350 --> 06:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
that in uh
 
06:04:22.708 --> 06:04:22.718 align:start position:0%
as a consideration with the cost as well
 
06:04:24.868 --> 06:04:24.878 align:start position:0%
so i'm definitely in favor of letting
 
06:04:26.948 --> 06:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
people take care of themselves so i'll
 
06:04:28.868 --> 06:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
be voting for this
 
06:04:33.270 --> 06:04:33.280 align:start position:0%

has a motion
 
06:07:38.230 --> 06:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman i move that we
 
06:07:39.910 --> 06:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
retain this bill because i think this
 
06:07:42.310 --> 06:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
bill needs work
 
06:07:44.948 --> 06:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
do we have a second i would second that
 
06:07:47.350 --> 06:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
weber but i see a lot of other hands up
 
06:07:47.360 --> 06:07:49.830 align:start position:0%
weber but i see a lot of other hands up
too

06:07:49.830 --> 06:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:52.948 --> 06:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
marsh moves weber seconds
 
06:07:55.350 --> 06:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
and uh representative marsh please speak
 
06:07:57.510 --> 06:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
to this
 
06:08:00.548 --> 06:08:00.558 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to allow small
 
06:08:01.990 --> 06:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
farms in the state of new hampshire to
 
06:08:03.590 --> 06:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
be able to sell their goods directly to
 
06:08:05.510 --> 06:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
the public i think there may be some
 
06:08:07.990 --> 06:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
issues regarding internet and that sort
 
06:08:09.590 --> 06:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
of thing in this bill
 
06:08:11.190 --> 06:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think this is something we can
 
06:08:13.510 --> 06:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
fix with a simple amendment i do think
 
06:08:15.350 --> 06:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
it warrants looking at more closely and
 
06:08:16.868 --> 06:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
therefore retaining the bill gives us
 
06:08:20.390 --> 06:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:22.628 --> 06:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
any other further discussion
 
06:08:24.948 --> 06:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh representative weber has her hand up
 
06:08:27.110 --> 06:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative webber please thank you
 
06:08:31.270 --> 06:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
for recognizing this mr chairman um i i
 
06:08:33.430 --> 06:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
concur with what representative marsh
 
06:08:34.868 --> 06:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
said and
 
06:08:37.590 --> 06:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing that we talked about
 
06:08:39.910 --> 06:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
was perhaps involving a member or
 
06:08:41.510 --> 06:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
members of the environment and
 
06:08:43.350 --> 06:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee
 
06:08:45.750 --> 06:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
who have also dealt with this issue
 
06:08:47.910 --> 06:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
extensively in the past
 
06:08:50.548 --> 06:08:50.558 align:start position:0%
to have their input
 
06:08:52.788 --> 06:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
as well as ours because i think it
 
06:08:58.150 --> 06:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:00.230 --> 06:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative clerk has his hand up
 
06:09:00.240 --> 06:09:03.110 align:start position:0%
representative clerk has his hand up
representative

06:09:03.110 --> 06:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:05.830 --> 06:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
yes and i would uh echo that um peter
 
06:09:09.990 --> 06:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
bitsby the vice chair at uh ena uh
 
06:09:12.070 --> 06:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
contacted me about this and his comment
 
06:09:15.110 --> 06:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
was that they actually just they did not
 
06:09:16.470 --> 06:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
change other parts of the bill but they
 
06:09:19.430 --> 06:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
did vote to increase the cap to 35 000
 
06:09:20.548 --> 06:09:20.558 align:start position:0%
last year
 
06:09:22.230 --> 06:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
and that
 
06:09:25.270 --> 06:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
the dhhs was okay with that at that time
 
06:09:27.030 --> 06:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
so this is one of those
 
06:09:29.110 --> 06:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
interdepartmental things so we do
 
06:09:30.230 --> 06:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
they've already processed it we
 
06:09:33.270 --> 06:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
definitely want to get them involved
 
06:09:34.548 --> 06:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:09:37.430 --> 06:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
i just want to dig in representative gay
 
06:09:39.990 --> 06:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to add that we were
 
06:09:42.788 --> 06:09:42.798 align:start position:0%
appointed it was pointed out to us that
 
06:09:45.030 --> 06:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
increasing the cap
 
06:09:47.270 --> 06:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
meant we had to fix something another
 
06:09:51.910 --> 06:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
limit and another another rsa are rule
 
06:09:53.350 --> 06:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
06:09:55.750 --> 06:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
i certainly support the goal
 
06:09:57.830 --> 06:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
but it looks like it's going to take
 
06:10:03.270 --> 06:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:05.670 --> 06:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
06:10:07.270 --> 06:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd like to just uh
 
06:10:09.110 --> 06:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
quickly say let me
 
06:10:10.548 --> 06:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
raise my hand here
 
06:10:12.628 --> 06:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
um yes please go ahead
 
06:10:14.310 --> 06:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
06:10:16.868 --> 06:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
i really i wish we had the time to sub
 
06:10:18.948 --> 06:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
go through subcommittee and get this
 
06:10:21.670 --> 06:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
done in normal conditions i think we
 
06:10:23.510 --> 06:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
could because i'm really worried to put
 
06:10:25.110 --> 06:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
this out another year you know time is
 
06:10:27.750 --> 06:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
of the essence to make these changes
 
06:10:29.270 --> 06:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
because we could get them applied for
 
06:10:31.190 --> 06:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
this harvest season
 
06:10:33.270 --> 06:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh but there but i do agree that there
 
06:10:35.350 --> 06:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
is some work that's needed to get this
 
06:10:37.670 --> 06:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
right and um i'll certainly if needed
 
06:10:39.830 --> 06:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer i'm a homesteader i i would
 
06:10:41.830 --> 06:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
like to go down this road sometime so i
 
06:10:43.590 --> 06:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
will volunteer
 
06:10:45.910 --> 06:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
to make this a real um
 
06:10:48.390 --> 06:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
retaining not just a death with dignity
 
06:10:48.400 --> 06:10:49.110 align:start position:0%
retaining not just a death with dignity
type

06:10:49.110 --> 06:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
type
 
06:10:52.470 --> 06:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:55.190 --> 06:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
06:10:55.200 --> 06:10:56.390 align:start position:0%
representative gay
um

06:10:56.390 --> 06:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:56.400 --> 06:10:58.628 align:start position:0%
um
how

06:10:58.628 --> 06:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
how
 
06:11:01.590 --> 06:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
okay here's it bluntly why can't we have
 
06:11:03.430 --> 06:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
the meetings why can't we have
 
06:11:05.510 --> 06:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meetings because
 
06:11:07.190 --> 06:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
we don't have to go anywhere we can do
 
06:11:08.390 --> 06:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
them from home
 
06:11:11.510 --> 06:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of time first of all
 
06:11:13.270 --> 06:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
the chair did not say we cannot have
 
06:11:15.190 --> 06:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meetings
 
06:11:17.110 --> 06:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
the chair said that we are being
 
06:11:19.510 --> 06:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
encouraged to have fewer quite a bit
 
06:11:21.830 --> 06:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
fewer of them because it has to do with
 
06:11:24.310 --> 06:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
the staff on the fourth floor i have
 
06:11:26.310 --> 06:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
asked the staff on the fourth floor
 
06:11:28.708 --> 06:11:28.718 align:start position:0%
today for something and they said they
 
06:11:31.270 --> 06:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
are massively short-handed today which
 
06:11:33.750 --> 06:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
is why representative weber is doing the
 
06:11:36.548 --> 06:11:36.558 align:start position:0%
part that often christina dyer did so
 
06:11:38.948 --> 06:11:38.958 align:start position:0%
that is why we cannot have a lot of
 
06:11:41.990 --> 06:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meetings so we're gonna
 
06:11:44.868 --> 06:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
we will probably have a few but uh we're
 
06:11:46.708 --> 06:11:46.718 align:start position:0%
not able to have a lot of them well i
 
06:11:48.310 --> 06:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
realize their work
 
06:11:50.948 --> 06:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
is often fitting from us it would be
 
06:11:52.788 --> 06:11:52.798 align:start position:0%
helpful to know
 
06:11:54.628 --> 06:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
all the i don't know
 
06:11:56.708 --> 06:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
all the extra work they have to do to
 
06:12:01.990 --> 06:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:04.548 --> 06:12:04.558 align:start position:0%
can someone one of us do that or is my
 
06:12:04.558 --> 06:12:05.670 align:start position:0%
can someone one of us do that or is my
statute

06:12:05.670 --> 06:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:12:09.830 --> 06:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's actually not quite that simple um
 
06:12:12.070 --> 06:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
you know it has to be noticed in the
 
06:12:12.080 --> 06:12:13.350 align:start position:0%
you know it has to be noticed in the
calendar

06:12:13.350 --> 06:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
06:12:16.548 --> 06:12:16.558 align:start position:0%
uh there has to be somebody monitoring a
 
06:12:19.750 --> 06:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated number so that the public
 
06:12:23.510 --> 06:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
can dial in or email ins and
 
06:12:24.868 --> 06:12:24.878 align:start position:0%
let us know if they're having
 
06:12:24.878 --> 06:12:26.948 align:start position:0%
let us know if they're having
difficulties

06:12:26.948 --> 06:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
06:12:31.830 --> 06:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:34.230 --> 06:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
so some committee meetings have to be
 
06:12:36.708 --> 06:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
made to the public too
 
06:12:38.788 --> 06:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely every time we hold the
 
06:12:41.990 --> 06:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
meeting it is a public meeting
 
06:12:44.548 --> 06:12:44.558 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily a public hearing
 
06:12:46.628 --> 06:12:46.638 align:start position:0%
the public doesn't necessarily get the
 
06:12:49.430 --> 06:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
right to speak but we all of our
 
06:12:51.430 --> 06:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
meetings and all of our subcommittee
 
06:12:54.548 --> 06:12:54.558 align:start position:0%
meetings must be open to the public and
 
06:12:56.470 --> 06:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
are subject to the notice requirements
 
06:12:58.150 --> 06:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
of the right to know law
 
06:12:58.160 --> 06:12:59.270 align:start position:0%
of the right to know law
okay

06:12:59.270 --> 06:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:13:02.470 --> 06:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
and none of us could uh host a zoo
 
06:13:04.548 --> 06:13:04.558 align:start position:0%
meeting it has to be
 
06:13:04.558 --> 06:13:05.510 align:start position:0%
meeting it has to be
um

06:13:05.510 --> 06:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:09.670 --> 06:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
hosted with staff from here
 
06:13:12.470 --> 06:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
the i'm not going to answer for the
 
06:13:15.590 --> 06:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
current administration but when i was in
 
06:13:19.350 --> 06:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
the majority and working on this issue
 
06:13:21.750 --> 06:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
these are not meetings that are set up
 
06:13:24.548 --> 06:13:24.558 align:start position:0%
under anybody's 40-minute zoom use
 
06:13:24.558 --> 06:13:25.510 align:start position:0%
under anybody's 40-minute zoom use
meeting

06:13:25.510 --> 06:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
06:13:28.868 --> 06:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
these are webinars that are done on a
 
06:13:31.510 --> 06:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
much higher level of licensing
 
06:13:34.948 --> 06:13:34.958 align:start position:0%
and we do it that way to ensure things
 
06:13:36.948 --> 06:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
like that
 
06:13:38.868 --> 06:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
committee members can speak and members
 
06:13:41.030 --> 06:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
of the public can't we do it to ensure
 
06:13:43.350 --> 06:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
that we are not zoom bombed while we are
 
06:13:45.030 --> 06:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
holding the meetings
 
06:13:47.990 --> 06:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh each notice for a committee member is
 
06:13:51.590 --> 06:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
set out separately in that case
 
06:13:58.548 --> 06:13:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:58.558 --> 06:13:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
i

06:13:59.590 --> 06:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:13:59.600 --> 06:14:00.470 align:start position:0%
i
we

06:14:00.470 --> 06:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:14:03.030 --> 06:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
when we were in the majority felt that
 
06:14:05.510 --> 06:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
it was inadvisable to just have
 
06:14:07.590 --> 06:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
people going off and having meetings at
 
06:14:09.830 --> 06:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
any old time because the notice
 
06:14:11.750 --> 06:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
requirements and other requirements
 
06:14:13.510 --> 06:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
might get skimped on
 
06:14:13.520 --> 06:14:14.708 align:start position:0%
might get skimped on
and

06:14:14.708 --> 06:14:14.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:14:16.708 --> 06:14:16.718 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the current thinking
 
06:14:18.868 --> 06:14:18.878 align:start position:0%
on it is but my guess is that they have
 
06:14:23.670 --> 06:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:26.708 --> 06:14:26.718 align:start position:0%
anyone else to the question of
 
06:14:29.990 --> 06:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
homestead food operation licensure bill
 
06:14:32.868 --> 06:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
retention and representative knurk waved
 
06:14:34.948 --> 06:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
at the camera again representative
 
06:14:37.030 --> 06:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
please i only wanted to say perhaps
 
06:14:38.310 --> 06:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative webber this might be a
 
06:14:39.670 --> 06:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
good time for you to give a reminder to
 
06:14:42.070 --> 06:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
the whole committee that we likewise
 
06:14:43.910 --> 06:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
cannot send an email to the whole
 
06:14:43.920 --> 06:14:45.270 align:start position:0%
cannot send an email to the whole
committee

06:14:45.270 --> 06:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:14:48.628 --> 06:14:48.638 align:start position:0%
regarding our deliberations on a bill uh
 
06:14:50.788 --> 06:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
nor can we even be
 
06:14:52.150 --> 06:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
calling a bunch of people or meeting
 
06:14:53.990 --> 06:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
with them anything over outside of your
 
06:14:56.470 --> 06:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
caucus or over the majority or the the
 
06:14:58.548 --> 06:14:58.558 align:start position:0%
quorum plus one because we have to make
 
06:15:00.788 --> 06:15:00.798 align:start position:0%
sure we all abide by 91a did i get that
 
06:15:00.798 --> 06:15:01.670 align:start position:0%
sure we all abide by 91a did i get that
correct

06:15:01.670 --> 06:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:15:04.548 --> 06:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
that's correct and the other part of 91a
 
06:15:07.750 --> 06:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
is you cannot make 14 make 21 separate
 
06:15:09.430 --> 06:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
phone calls either
 
06:15:13.190 --> 06:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
um you cannot do in series that which
 
06:15:14.788 --> 06:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
you could not do
 
06:15:17.110 --> 06:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
all altogether so
 
06:15:17.120 --> 06:15:18.310 align:start position:0%
all altogether so
um

06:15:18.310 --> 06:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:20.548 --> 06:15:20.558 align:start position:0%
you know if it's a caucus it's fine if
 
06:15:22.628 --> 06:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
it's less than half of the committee
 
06:15:24.948 --> 06:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
it's fine but when it goes beyond that
 
06:15:30.470 --> 06:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:33.510 --> 06:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
i do like the idea of homesteading
 
06:15:35.910 --> 06:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
for food operation i made quite a bit of
 
06:15:38.788 --> 06:15:38.798 align:start position:0%
money with a little vegetable garden as
 
06:15:40.868 --> 06:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
a child so
 
06:15:45.030 --> 06:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
this is just taking it to a bigger scale
 
06:15:47.270 --> 06:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
and representative shapiro has a handout
 
06:15:49.910 --> 06:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
06:15:52.070 --> 06:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
i just want to say that um
 
06:15:54.708 --> 06:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
should we retain this bill another area
 
06:15:56.788 --> 06:15:56.798 align:start position:0%
of the bill that we did talk about
 
06:15:59.270 --> 06:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
working on was the addition of poultry
 
06:16:02.708 --> 06:16:02.718 align:start position:0%
products and whether that was a
 
06:16:04.708 --> 06:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
i can't remember the terminology but a
 
06:16:07.830 --> 06:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
shelf safe product
 
06:16:09.110 --> 06:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
so that would be another thing that
 
06:16:13.190 --> 06:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
should be explored when it is worked on
 
06:16:14.708 --> 06:16:14.718 align:start position:0%
and come summer i'm sure there'll be
 
06:16:16.868 --> 06:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
numbers of people who will be
 
06:16:18.948 --> 06:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
very willing to work with
 
06:16:18.958 --> 06:16:20.150 align:start position:0%
very willing to work with
um

06:16:20.150 --> 06:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:21.750 --> 06:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
each other
 
06:16:23.510 --> 06:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative nerc has his hand up
 
06:16:25.830 --> 06:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
again yes go ahead please
 
06:16:27.350 --> 06:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
yes i just happen to know a bit about
 
06:16:28.470 --> 06:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
this because of some of the work i've
 
06:16:30.390 --> 06:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
done with ena there are there's a
 
06:16:32.548 --> 06:16:32.558 align:start position:0%
separate whole program for poultry
 
06:16:34.470 --> 06:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
allowing it to be done by the small
 
06:16:37.030 --> 06:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
producer they have a bird limit
 
06:16:38.708 --> 06:16:38.718 align:start position:0%
so that you don't have to go through a
 
06:16:41.190 --> 06:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
federal slaughterhouse and so on so
 
06:16:43.670 --> 06:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's already in statute for
 
06:16:46.868 --> 06:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
um small farms anyway so again that's
 
06:16:48.390 --> 06:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
why we want to get dna people here so we
 
06:16:50.390 --> 06:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
don't do something redundant which
 
06:16:52.070 --> 06:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
already exists in statute it's a rabbit
 
06:16:54.548 --> 06:16:54.558 align:start position:0%
and poultry were brought in together a
 
06:16:56.070 --> 06:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
number of years ago
 
06:17:01.190 --> 06:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:03.750 --> 06:17:03.760 align:start position:0%

got down here
 
06:19:10.948 --> 06:19:10.958 align:start position:0%
the uh amendment to hb
 
06:19:13.670 --> 06:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
220 that i believe you've sent to
 
06:19:13.680 --> 06:19:15.590 align:start position:0%
220 that i believe you've sent to
everybody

06:19:15.590 --> 06:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
06:19:15.600 --> 06:19:19.110 align:start position:0%
everybody
um

06:19:19.110 --> 06:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:22.548 --> 06:19:22.558 align:start position:0%
are you of a mind to um
 
06:19:25.110 --> 06:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
exec at this time
 
06:19:26.948 --> 06:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
i believe that's your call mr chairman
 
06:19:28.868 --> 06:19:28.878 align:start position:0%
but i am of the mind that this amendment
 
06:19:31.190 --> 06:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
fixes the problems with the bill so that
 
06:19:33.430 --> 06:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
we can actually affirm medical freedom
 
06:19:34.788 --> 06:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire without
 
06:19:36.628 --> 06:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
interfering with the public health
 
06:19:38.150 --> 06:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
operations of the department of health
 
06:19:39.590 --> 06:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
06:19:39.600 --> 06:19:40.708 align:start position:0%
and human services
i

06:19:40.708 --> 06:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:19:43.670 --> 06:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask mr chairman we have not
 
06:19:46.708 --> 06:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
seen that yet and that was a bill of
 
06:19:48.868 --> 06:19:48.878 align:start position:0%
significant concern is there any
 
06:19:48.878 --> 06:19:50.230 align:start position:0%
significant concern is there any
possibility

06:19:50.230 --> 06:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
06:19:52.628 --> 06:19:52.638 align:start position:0%
that those of us who already are using
 
06:19:54.230 --> 06:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
up the screens of three different
 
06:19:56.310 --> 06:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
devices and cannot
 
06:19:58.150 --> 06:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
consistent with that look at the
 
06:20:00.390 --> 06:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
amendment can we put this one off to
 
06:20:01.830 --> 06:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
another time
 
06:20:03.990 --> 06:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
we could do that yes
 
06:20:06.230 --> 06:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh it is a brief amendment it's only 12
 
06:20:08.470 --> 06:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
lines long but still
 
06:20:10.948 --> 06:20:10.958 align:start position:0%
if that is your desire i could honor
 
06:20:12.708 --> 06:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
that certainly
 
06:20:14.868 --> 06:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
i would i would very much appreciate it
 
06:20:17.670 --> 06:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
on behalf of myself at least um i'm
 
06:20:20.548 --> 06:20:20.558 align:start position:0%
looking at my list and it may not be
 
06:20:23.430 --> 06:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate but i thought that 131 might
 
06:20:25.430 --> 06:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
be ready to go that's reporting of
 
06:20:28.750 --> 06:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare associated infections
 
06:20:32.150 --> 06:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
131 okay
 
06:20:36.230 --> 06:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
i have that i do not see that in my okay
 
06:20:38.708 --> 06:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
to exact folder
 
06:20:40.948 --> 06:20:40.958 align:start position:0%
never mind sorry
 
06:20:40.958 --> 06:20:42.070 align:start position:0%
never mind sorry
um

06:20:42.070 --> 06:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:46.548 --> 06:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
words i have under 131 words considering
 
06:20:48.948 --> 06:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
cushman's questions
 
06:20:50.470 --> 06:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
about the word
 
06:20:50.480 --> 06:20:52.708 align:start position:0%
about the word
measures

06:20:52.708 --> 06:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
measures
 
06:20:54.708 --> 06:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
and have we gone anywhere with that are
 
06:20:58.230 --> 06:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
you going to do an amendment or
 
06:20:59.590 --> 06:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
oh sure
 
06:21:03.510 --> 06:21:03.520 align:start position:0%

06:21:08.708 --> 06:21:08.718 align:start position:0%
don't have one written up okay
 
06:21:10.708 --> 06:21:10.718 align:start position:0%
representative what i believe i can't
 
06:21:12.470 --> 06:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
find it but i think it's your bill
 
06:21:12.480 --> 06:21:13.430 align:start position:0%
find it but i think it's your bill
correct

06:21:13.430 --> 06:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:21:21.750 --> 06:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:23.190 --> 06:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
actually my notes on this was
 
06:21:24.868 --> 06:21:24.878 align:start position:0%
representative woods was one of your
 
06:21:26.788 --> 06:21:26.798 align:start position:0%
research measures
 
06:21:28.868 --> 06:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
would you representative king i think
 
06:21:30.628 --> 06:21:30.638 align:start position:0%
has a has a good point would you say
 
06:21:33.990 --> 06:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
that louder please yes my notes i had uh
 
06:21:36.310 --> 06:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative woods was to research the
 
06:21:38.390 --> 06:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
word measures
 
06:21:39.910 --> 06:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct
 
06:21:42.390 --> 06:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
i i did get a chance to talk with uh
 
06:21:43.990 --> 06:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
06:21:44.000 --> 06:21:45.110 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
uh

06:21:45.110 --> 06:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:21:47.190 --> 06:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative cool fault and i've
 
06:21:49.990 --> 06:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
been playing telephone tag uh i did get
 
06:21:53.590 --> 06:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
a chance to uh speak at link with dhhs
 
06:21:56.548 --> 06:21:56.558 align:start position:0%
uh about both items i.e the vaccination
 
06:21:59.590 --> 06:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
issue as well as the measures uh but if
 
06:22:01.510 --> 06:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
06:22:03.110 --> 06:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
amendment coming forward that would have
 
06:22:07.110 --> 06:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:11.030 --> 06:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
this was again number 131
 
06:22:13.990 --> 06:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
in my wake file so anything we need to
 
06:22:16.150 --> 06:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
do if that could be done in the next
 
06:22:18.788 --> 06:22:18.798 align:start position:0%
week representative bushman
 
06:22:20.230 --> 06:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
um i
 
06:22:23.030 --> 06:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
i don't have an amendment to propose
 
06:22:24.788 --> 06:22:24.798 align:start position:0%
personally i think the bill should be
 
06:22:24.798 --> 06:22:27.270 align:start position:0%
personally i think the bill should be
itl

06:22:27.270 --> 06:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
itl
 
06:22:29.670 --> 06:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
06:22:32.070 --> 06:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
that having been said representative
 
06:22:32.080 --> 06:22:33.190 align:start position:0%
that having been said representative
cushman

06:22:33.190 --> 06:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
cushman
 
06:22:36.070 --> 06:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
says she thinks the bill should be itl
 
06:22:37.750 --> 06:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
and so that
 
06:22:40.230 --> 06:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
um i think representative woods you've
 
06:22:43.830 --> 06:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
done some homework on this and
 
06:22:46.070 --> 06:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's your bill would you
 
06:22:48.628 --> 06:22:48.638 align:start position:0%
like us to execute now
 
06:22:50.948 --> 06:22:50.958 align:start position:0%
uh that's fine with me i didn't get a
 
06:22:52.868 --> 06:22:52.878 align:start position:0%
chance to connect as i said we played
 
06:22:54.390 --> 06:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
telephone tag with representative
 
06:22:54.400 --> 06:22:56.070 align:start position:0%

cofoult
 
06:22:56.080 --> 06:22:56.868 align:start position:0%
cofoult
if

06:22:56.868 --> 06:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:22:58.470 --> 06:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
he has any uh
 
06:23:01.590 --> 06:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
reservations at this juncture i would
 
06:23:04.310 --> 06:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
certainly be amenable to waiting but i
 
06:23:05.510 --> 06:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
could go ahead
 
06:23:06.800 --> 06:23:06.810 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
06:23:06.810 --> 06:23:08.548 align:start position:0%
what's going on
[Music]

06:23:08.548 --> 06:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:23:10.628 --> 06:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
representative kofold good to go or wait
 
06:23:12.070 --> 06:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
a week
 
06:23:12.080 --> 06:23:13.350 align:start position:0%
a week
um

06:23:13.350 --> 06:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:14.948 --> 06:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
i i actually i don't
 
06:23:18.310 --> 06:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
well i i'm i'm happy to talk to uh
 
06:23:20.150 --> 06:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
06:23:22.948 --> 06:23:22.958 align:start position:0%
um i i have serious concerns about the
 
06:23:25.030 --> 06:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
language as it is currently
 
06:23:29.910 --> 06:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
um open to hearing uh what you know
 
06:23:32.310 --> 06:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm i'm open to listening i guess
 
06:23:34.390 --> 06:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
my concern is that no matter
 
06:23:36.948 --> 06:23:36.958 align:start position:0%
what answer comes back there's still a
 
06:23:36.958 --> 06:23:38.708 align:start position:0%
what answer comes back there's still a
um

06:23:38.708 --> 06:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:39.990 --> 06:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
still a problem with the fact that the
 
06:23:41.430 --> 06:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
language is vague
 
06:23:43.830 --> 06:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
um if
 
06:23:45.350 --> 06:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
you know if if there were an amendment
 
06:23:47.910 --> 06:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
to be proposed i i guess i would propose
 
06:23:49.430 --> 06:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
striking the
 
06:23:51.750 --> 06:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
language that has been added to section
 
06:23:51.760 --> 06:23:52.868 align:start position:0%
language that has been added to section
three

06:23:52.868 --> 06:23:52.878 align:start position:0%
three
 
06:23:55.990 --> 06:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
um and simply uh
 
06:23:58.548 --> 06:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
simply leaving the the language in uh or
 
06:24:01.110 --> 06:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
the s simply leaving the strikeout uh at
 
06:24:03.350 --> 06:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
the on in lines four and five
 
06:24:05.430 --> 06:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
um you know i would have to review again
 
06:24:08.150 --> 06:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
in detail but i i have serious concerns
 
06:24:09.910 --> 06:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
about the inclusion of the language on
 
06:24:12.948 --> 06:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
lines 18 to 20.
 
06:24:14.310 --> 06:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
then i'm
 
06:24:16.628 --> 06:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
ruled that it goes in my weight a week
 
06:24:16.638 --> 06:24:17.910 align:start position:0%
ruled that it goes in my weight a week
file

06:24:17.910 --> 06:24:17.920 align:start position:0%

06:24:20.230 --> 06:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
and i would suggest that anybody with
 
06:24:22.230 --> 06:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns
 
06:24:25.510 --> 06:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
have uh a good conversation with the
 
06:24:27.510 --> 06:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor which may result nothing or may
 
06:24:29.110 --> 06:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
resolve something that's being the
 
06:24:32.948 --> 06:24:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:32.958 --> 06:24:34.390 align:start position:0%

06:25:42.788 --> 06:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
the correct amendment number is 0 2 7 0
 
06:25:42.798 --> 06:25:46.948 align:start position:0%
the correct amendment number is 0 2 7 0

06:25:51.830 --> 06:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
the correct amendment number is
 
06:25:57.590 --> 06:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:02.070 --> 06:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:02.080 --> 06:26:03.190 align:start position:0%
 
zero

06:26:03.190 --> 06:26:03.200 align:start position:0%

06:26:21.670 --> 06:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:23.670 --> 06:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
when should this have been sent to us
 
06:26:25.750 --> 06:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
again mr chairman i'm going to ask your
 
06:26:27.990 --> 06:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
indulgence that came in
 
06:26:30.868 --> 06:26:30.878 align:start position:0%
according to my email 10 or 15 minutes
 
06:26:32.708 --> 06:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
ago maybe it was a little longer than
 
06:26:32.718 --> 06:26:33.830 align:start position:0%
ago maybe it was a little longer than
that

06:26:33.830 --> 06:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:26:37.510 --> 06:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
um it is 3 30 and if there's anything
 
06:26:38.788 --> 06:26:38.798 align:start position:0%
that has
 
06:26:42.310 --> 06:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
a significant amendment i can't see the
 
06:26:44.948 --> 06:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
amendments on my screen
 
06:26:47.750 --> 06:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
and still participate in the meeting
 
06:26:47.760 --> 06:26:48.708 align:start position:0%
and still participate in the meeting
and

06:26:48.708 --> 06:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:26:51.510 --> 06:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
i think other people are in that
 
06:26:53.110 --> 06:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
condition as well
 
06:26:55.670 --> 06:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
and given that we have to figure out
 
06:26:57.910 --> 06:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
where the bill is in our filing system
 
06:26:59.830 --> 06:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
and any previous amendments and this
 
06:26:59.840 --> 06:27:01.190 align:start position:0%
and any previous amendments and this
amendment

06:27:01.190 --> 06:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:27:04.868 --> 06:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
i would be very appreciative if if
 
06:27:07.430 --> 06:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
we could hold it for the next meeting we
 
06:27:09.670 --> 06:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
will do that
 
06:27:12.948 --> 06:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
that would be very much appreciated now
 
06:27:16.390 --> 06:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
is there any other low-picking fruit
 
06:27:18.628 --> 06:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
i'm going to hold the vulnerable adult
 
06:27:20.830 --> 06:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
bill for a week
 
06:27:23.510 --> 06:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
um and is there any low-picking
 
06:27:26.468 --> 06:27:26.478 align:start position:0%
low-hanging fruit that we might i ask
 
06:27:28.468 --> 06:27:28.478 align:start position:0%
could i ask one question
 
06:27:30.310 --> 06:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
on 157.
 
06:27:32.310 --> 06:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
he mentioned representative marsh
 
06:27:33.830 --> 06:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there was a problem on
 
06:27:36.628 --> 06:27:36.638 align:start position:0%
line 14. the bill i have in front of me
 
06:27:38.628 --> 06:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
only has 13 lines
 
06:27:41.430 --> 06:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
am i got an old version
 
06:27:41.440 --> 06:27:42.150 align:start position:0%
am i got an old version
uh

06:27:42.150 --> 06:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:27:43.670 --> 06:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the original bill
 
06:27:45.030 --> 06:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative snow and not the
 
06:27:47.430 --> 06:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that was circulated uh
 
06:27:49.750 --> 06:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
previously there was a problem on line
 
06:27:53.270 --> 06:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
14 of the amendment where uh a number 88
 
06:27:55.270 --> 06:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
was written down as an eight so we
 
06:27:56.548 --> 06:27:56.558 align:start position:0%
corrected that that's the only
 
06:27:58.468 --> 06:27:58.478 align:start position:0%
difference that amendment has been sent
 
06:28:00.390 --> 06:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
to us how long ago
 
06:28:02.310 --> 06:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative weber said she
 
06:28:04.468 --> 06:28:04.478 align:start position:0%
received it approximately 15 minutes ago
 
06:28:04.478 --> 06:28:05.670 align:start position:0%
received it approximately 15 minutes ago
okay

06:28:05.670 --> 06:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:28:08.230 --> 06:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
i received the second amendment just
 
06:28:10.230 --> 06:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
recently but there was an earlier
 
06:28:12.150 --> 06:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative marsh
 
06:28:13.670 --> 06:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
spent and i don't remember when that
 
06:28:15.990 --> 06:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
came to us but the one that we have that
 
06:28:19.030 --> 06:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
was at 3 40 friday afternoon
 
06:28:20.548 --> 06:28:20.558 align:start position:0%
but the one we have to look at is the
 
06:28:22.948 --> 06:28:22.958 align:start position:0%
one that came in today correct
 
06:28:24.628 --> 06:28:24.638 align:start position:0%
yes there's that minor correction in
 
06:28:25.670 --> 06:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
this one
 
06:28:27.350 --> 06:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:28:30.230 --> 06:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay that's off till next week
 
06:28:33.830 --> 06:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
and the last one i'd like to do today
 
06:28:36.548 --> 06:28:36.558 align:start position:0%
um is rep uh
 
06:28:40.390 --> 06:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 185 footnotes
 
06:28:43.190 --> 06:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
we concluded the hearing last monday
 
06:28:45.510 --> 06:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
removing the work for tuesday
 
06:28:47.990 --> 06:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
removing the work requirement of the new

[Music]

06:29:13.280 --> 06:29:14.310 align:start position:0%
 
second

06:29:14.310 --> 06:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
second
 
06:29:17.430 --> 06:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative shapiro um
 
06:29:20.390 --> 06:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
we recall the discussion but uh remind
 
06:29:20.400 --> 06:29:24.708 align:start position:0%
we recall the discussion but uh remind
us

06:29:24.708 --> 06:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:27.590 --> 06:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay um i didn't expect this one to come
 
06:29:30.628 --> 06:29:30.638 align:start position:0%
today but i'll do my best um shapiro if
 
06:29:35.750 --> 06:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:37.750 --> 06:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
i think we could go through with it
 
06:29:40.830 --> 06:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
your pleasure go ahead okay
 
06:29:45.030 --> 06:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
um i think my testimony spoke in detail
 
06:29:47.750 --> 06:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
to um
 
06:29:50.390 --> 06:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
why i think it's a good idea to repeal
 
06:29:52.868 --> 06:29:52.878 align:start position:0%
the work requirement slash community
 
06:29:52.878 --> 06:29:54.830 align:start position:0%
the work requirement slash community
engagement

06:29:54.830 --> 06:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
06:29:58.868 --> 06:29:58.878 align:start position:0%
um aspect of expanded medicaid
 
06:29:58.878 --> 06:30:01.190 align:start position:0%
um aspect of expanded medicaid
um

06:30:01.190 --> 06:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:04.090 --> 06:30:04.100 align:start position:0%
i can go through some of it again um
 
06:30:04.100 --> 06:30:05.830 align:start position:0%
i can go through some of it again um

06:30:05.830 --> 06:30:05.840 align:start position:0%

06:30:07.590 --> 06:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
abbreviate it
 
06:30:07.600 --> 06:30:07.970 align:start position:0%
abbreviate it
um

06:30:07.970 --> 06:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:07.980 --> 06:30:09.670 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

06:30:09.670 --> 06:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:30:09.680 --> 06:30:11.430 align:start position:0%
[Music]
well

06:30:11.430 --> 06:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:30:16.628 --> 06:30:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:19.190 --> 06:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
so while i believe that
 
06:30:20.868 --> 06:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
this was um
 
06:30:23.430 --> 06:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
came into law in 2018 and that was
 
06:30:25.990 --> 06:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
before my time in the house and i think
 
06:30:28.390 --> 06:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
as i said in my testimony i think that
 
06:30:29.990 --> 06:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
this was a
 
06:30:32.468 --> 06:30:32.478 align:start position:0%
compromise made in good faith i believe
 
06:30:35.270 --> 06:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
there was a democratic governor
 
06:30:38.310 --> 06:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
and majorities in the house and senate
 
06:30:41.750 --> 06:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
for the republicans and it was a
 
06:30:44.230 --> 06:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
compromise made in good faith um
 
06:30:46.390 --> 06:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
bringing together two different philos
 
06:30:48.548 --> 06:30:48.558 align:start position:0%
philosophical points of view
 
06:30:50.788 --> 06:30:50.798 align:start position:0%
so that in fact
 
06:30:52.628 --> 06:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid
 
06:30:54.708 --> 06:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
could be renewed for five years and that
 
06:30:57.670 --> 06:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
did happen and it was called the
 
06:31:01.990 --> 06:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
granite advantage healthcare program
 
06:31:03.590 --> 06:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
but since that time i think the
 
06:31:06.960 --> 06:31:06.970 align:start position:0%
landscape has changed dramatically
 
06:31:06.970 --> 06:31:10.070 align:start position:0%
landscape has changed dramatically
[Music]

06:31:10.070 --> 06:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:12.468 --> 06:31:12.478 align:start position:0%
initially there were similar plans in
 
06:31:14.548 --> 06:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
other states
 
06:31:14.558 --> 06:31:16.628 align:start position:0%
other states
that

06:31:16.628 --> 06:31:16.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:31:19.190 --> 06:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
specifically arkansas where that had
 
06:31:20.788 --> 06:31:20.798 align:start position:0%
similar but less
 
06:31:22.708 --> 06:31:22.718 align:start position:0%
work requirements
 
06:31:25.910 --> 06:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
that intima implemented their plan
 
06:31:28.628 --> 06:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
they had a similar waiver
 
06:31:30.708 --> 06:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
and many many people lost their
 
06:31:33.030 --> 06:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
insurance i think it was 18 000 people
 
06:31:35.030 --> 06:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
lost their insurance in arkansas and
 
06:31:40.468 --> 06:31:40.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:42.310 --> 06:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
06:31:44.548 --> 06:31:44.558 align:start position:0%
health and human services attempted to
 
06:31:48.468 --> 06:31:48.478 align:start position:0%
implement our version of the plan
 
06:31:52.468 --> 06:31:52.478 align:start position:0%
and i believe this would have been 2019
 
06:31:55.510 --> 06:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
and i had considerable difficulty
 
06:31:57.430 --> 06:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
registering people
 
06:31:59.590 --> 06:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
who would have qualified for the work
 
06:32:02.230 --> 06:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
requirement so i believe it was out of
 
06:32:04.948 --> 06:32:04.958 align:start position:0%
50 000 people that might have been part
 
06:32:07.750 --> 06:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
of the program 20 000 of them
 
06:32:09.830 --> 06:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
um were not able to be registered either
 
06:32:12.230 --> 06:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
they couldn't be reached or
 
06:32:14.708 --> 06:32:14.718 align:start position:0%
um they couldn't get them successfully
 
06:32:18.548 --> 06:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:22.310 --> 06:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
a considerable amount of money was spent
 
06:32:24.310 --> 06:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
trying to roll out the plan and
 
06:32:26.150 --> 06:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of effort from
 
06:32:28.788 --> 06:32:28.798 align:start position:0%
health and human services was spent
 
06:32:30.468 --> 06:32:30.478 align:start position:0%
trying to lay out the plan but governor
 
06:32:30.478 --> 06:32:31.670 align:start position:0%
trying to lay out the plan but governor

06:32:31.670 --> 06:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
sununu
 
06:32:31.680 --> 06:32:33.910 align:start position:0%
sununu
um

06:32:33.910 --> 06:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:36.390 --> 06:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
at a certain point acknowledged that it
 
06:32:37.830 --> 06:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
hadn't been done
 
06:32:40.390 --> 06:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
satisfactorily and they deferred it at
 
06:32:41.510 --> 06:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
that point
 
06:32:43.430 --> 06:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the meantime there's been a series of
 
06:32:45.910 --> 06:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:48.788 --> 06:32:48.798 align:start position:0%
both for kentucky and arkansas who had
 
06:32:51.350 --> 06:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
similar plans and new hampshire
 
06:32:54.628 --> 06:32:54.638 align:start position:0%
where federal courts struck down these
 
06:32:54.638 --> 06:32:57.590 align:start position:0%
where federal courts struck down these
waivers

06:32:57.590 --> 06:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:02.708 --> 06:33:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:05.190 --> 06:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
the core principle of medicaid is that
 
06:33:07.830 --> 06:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
it is a health care program for
 
06:33:09.270 --> 06:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
indigent people
 
06:33:11.590 --> 06:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
and that it is not a work readiness
 
06:33:14.390 --> 06:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
program or a character building program
 
06:33:16.868 --> 06:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
so these
 
06:33:19.670 --> 06:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
programs in arkansas kentucky and new
 
06:33:23.750 --> 06:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:27.190 --> 06:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
ruled unlawful by federal courts
 
06:33:30.390 --> 06:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
at this very point
 
06:33:32.468 --> 06:33:32.478 align:start position:0%
there is an appeal
 
06:33:35.510 --> 06:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
and i believe it is the arkansas and the
 
06:33:37.430 --> 06:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i know it's the arkansas
 
06:33:38.868 --> 06:33:38.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:33:40.548 --> 06:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
case combined
 
06:33:42.390 --> 06:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
to the supreme court
 
06:33:44.628 --> 06:33:44.638 align:start position:0%
that the former
 
06:33:46.390 --> 06:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
trump administration
 
06:33:48.070 --> 06:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
brought with the support of new
 
06:33:49.750 --> 06:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire and arkansas
 
06:33:49.760 --> 06:33:52.310 align:start position:0%
hampshire and arkansas
and

06:33:52.310 --> 06:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:55.510 --> 06:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
as henry lipman said during our hearings
 
06:33:58.548 --> 06:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
they had just scheduled oral arguments
 
06:34:01.990 --> 06:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
for the supreme court on
 
06:34:04.868 --> 06:34:04.878 align:start position:0%
march 29th
 
06:34:07.030 --> 06:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
but we shouldn't think in any way that
 
06:34:08.948 --> 06:34:08.958 align:start position:0%
that means there'll be a ruling on march
 
06:34:08.958 --> 06:34:10.708 align:start position:0%
that means there'll be a ruling on march
29th

06:34:10.708 --> 06:34:10.718 align:start position:0%
29th
 
06:34:13.750 --> 06:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
there's likely or will be a ruling weeks
 
06:34:16.310 --> 06:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
or months later
 
06:34:18.868 --> 06:34:18.878 align:start position:0%
possibly in june when many supreme court
 
06:34:21.510 --> 06:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
rulings come out
 
06:34:24.708 --> 06:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
in the meantime i'd say another factor
 
06:34:27.110 --> 06:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of repealing this work
 
06:34:29.670 --> 06:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
requirement is that
 
06:34:29.680 --> 06:34:32.548 align:start position:0%
requirement is that
um

06:34:32.548 --> 06:34:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:34.628 --> 06:34:34.638 align:start position:0%
as all of us are having to deal with as
 
06:34:38.868 --> 06:34:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:40.230 --> 06:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
came to be
 
06:34:41.670 --> 06:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
06:34:44.390 --> 06:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
in light of covid the idea of
 
06:34:46.708 --> 06:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
implementing this work requirement is
 
06:34:48.230 --> 06:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
even less
 
06:34:48.240 --> 06:34:49.510 align:start position:0%
even less
viable

06:34:49.510 --> 06:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
viable
 
06:34:52.390 --> 06:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
the idea of removing people from their
 
06:34:54.788 --> 06:34:54.798 align:start position:0%
insurance which
 
06:34:56.548 --> 06:34:56.558 align:start position:0%
actually would be impossible anyway
 
06:34:58.390 --> 06:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
because the regulations don't allow it
 
06:35:00.548 --> 06:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
during this health emergency
 
06:35:00.558 --> 06:35:01.510 align:start position:0%
during this health emergency
um

06:35:01.510 --> 06:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:04.468 --> 06:35:04.478 align:start position:0%
but the ethical considerations about
 
06:35:06.948 --> 06:35:06.958 align:start position:0%
throwing people off their insurance
 
06:35:08.390 --> 06:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
and the
 
06:35:10.708 --> 06:35:10.718 align:start position:0%
public health considerations of having
 
06:35:10.718 --> 06:35:11.830 align:start position:0%
public health considerations of having
people

06:35:11.830 --> 06:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:35:13.590 --> 06:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
having to go to
 
06:35:16.948 --> 06:35:16.958 align:start position:0%
jobs and volunteer jobs and just going
 
06:35:18.788 --> 06:35:18.798 align:start position:0%
out and being around when there's a
 
06:35:20.868 --> 06:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
public health crisis and we're asking
 
06:35:22.468 --> 06:35:22.478 align:start position:0%
people to
 
06:35:24.310 --> 06:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
stay at home as much as possible is
 
06:35:27.030 --> 06:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
another consideration
 
06:35:27.040 --> 06:35:29.190 align:start position:0%
another consideration
um

06:35:29.190 --> 06:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:30.948 --> 06:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
i understand that this is a very
 
06:35:32.390 --> 06:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
emotional issue
 
06:35:35.750 --> 06:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
and i understand that people on one side
 
06:35:40.310 --> 06:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:41.830 --> 06:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
a human right
 
06:35:44.230 --> 06:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
and i would be count myself in that
 
06:35:44.240 --> 06:35:45.510 align:start position:0%
and i would be count myself in that
group

06:35:45.510 --> 06:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
group
 
06:35:49.190 --> 06:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:49.200 --> 06:35:50.500 align:start position:0%
 
because

06:35:50.500 --> 06:35:50.510 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:35:50.510 --> 06:35:52.628 align:start position:0%
because
[Music]

06:35:52.628 --> 06:35:52.638 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:35:56.310 --> 06:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
on some kind of principle or because
 
06:35:58.788 --> 06:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
god says it's a human right it's a human
 
06:36:01.190 --> 06:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
right if we make it a human right so
 
06:36:03.510 --> 06:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's why we have to make decisions
 
06:36:06.310 --> 06:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
like we're making today
 
06:36:06.320 --> 06:36:09.990 align:start position:0%
like we're making today
um

06:36:09.990 --> 06:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:11.350 --> 06:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
we're about
 
06:36:13.750 --> 06:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
two and a half years into the five years
 
06:36:16.390 --> 06:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
have expanded
 
06:36:18.628 --> 06:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid
 
06:36:20.948 --> 06:36:20.958 align:start position:0%
i do not think it's going to happen
 
06:36:23.030 --> 06:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the new biden
 
06:36:25.670 --> 06:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
administration is going to
 
06:36:28.390 --> 06:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
what they're going to do in terms of
 
06:36:31.430 --> 06:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
pursuing this case in the supreme court
 
06:36:34.310 --> 06:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
i just think that this program has run
 
06:36:37.910 --> 06:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
its course and we should repeal it
 
06:36:37.920 --> 06:36:39.510 align:start position:0%
its course and we should repeal it
and

06:36:39.510 --> 06:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:36:42.468 --> 06:36:42.478 align:start position:0%
align new hampshire statute with the
 
06:36:44.070 --> 06:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
federal reality
 
06:36:45.830 --> 06:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i understand that that will be a
 
06:36:48.070 --> 06:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
difficult emotional decision for some
 
06:36:52.788 --> 06:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:57.430 --> 06:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:59.510 --> 06:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
people should not be dependent on
 
06:37:01.430 --> 06:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
government subsidies and government
 
06:37:03.590 --> 06:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
programs and this would
 
06:37:05.670 --> 06:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
push people in the other direction
 
06:37:07.910 --> 06:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
but i think it is time to repeal this
 
06:37:10.310 --> 06:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
particular program
 
06:37:12.868 --> 06:37:12.878 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm glad to answer questions if
 
06:37:14.788 --> 06:37:14.798 align:start position:0%
people have them well this is an exact
 
06:37:17.110 --> 06:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
session and they may ask the sponsor
 
06:37:20.548 --> 06:37:20.558 align:start position:0%
questions or they may wish to make a
 
06:37:20.558 --> 06:37:22.548 align:start position:0%
questions or they may wish to make a
statement

06:37:22.548 --> 06:37:22.558 align:start position:0%
statement
 
06:37:25.750 --> 06:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
do we have hands up
 
06:37:28.948 --> 06:37:28.958 align:start position:0%
uh yes you have representative marsh and
 
06:37:31.270 --> 06:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
you have representative knurk
 
06:37:33.990 --> 06:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
let's start with representative marsh
 
06:37:36.230 --> 06:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative shapiro you
 
06:37:38.788 --> 06:37:38.798 align:start position:0%
and i have disagreed on this topic many
 
06:37:41.190 --> 06:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
times in the past and as many of you
 
06:37:44.548 --> 06:37:44.558 align:start position:0%
know uh i and several others in this
 
06:37:44.558 --> 06:37:46.390 align:start position:0%
know uh i and several others in this
meeting

06:37:46.390 --> 06:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
06:37:49.190 --> 06:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
struck an agreement with
 
06:37:51.270 --> 06:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
each other that we would include this
 
06:37:53.110 --> 06:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
provision as part of the medicaid
 
06:37:56.230 --> 06:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
expansion program and to me
 
06:37:58.230 --> 06:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
it feels like
 
06:38:00.150 --> 06:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
we are backing out of an agreement that
 
06:38:03.190 --> 06:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
was sincerely made on everyone's behalf
 
06:38:03.200 --> 06:38:04.150 align:start position:0%
was sincerely made on everyone's behalf
um

06:38:04.150 --> 06:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:06.628 --> 06:38:06.638 align:start position:0%
i agree that this uh provision is not
 
06:38:09.270 --> 06:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
being enforced at this time uh it may be
 
06:38:10.708 --> 06:38:10.718 align:start position:0%
that repealing this would make the
 
06:38:12.788 --> 06:38:12.798 align:start position:0%
question before the supreme court moved
 
06:38:14.548 --> 06:38:14.558 align:start position:0%
although henry littman said it would not
 
06:38:15.990 --> 06:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
save the state of new hampshire any
 
06:38:16.000 --> 06:38:18.310 align:start position:0%
save the state of new hampshire any
money

06:38:18.310 --> 06:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:20.390 --> 06:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
i i know certainly at this point in time
 
06:38:23.510 --> 06:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
it is against uh the law with kova to
 
06:38:25.750 --> 06:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
throw people off of the program uh who
 
06:38:27.830 --> 06:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
may not be abiding by it by this
 
06:38:29.910 --> 06:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
requirement but that being said we
 
06:38:32.628 --> 06:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be in covet forever uh
 
06:38:35.350 --> 06:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
and we make laws that last for a longer
 
06:38:37.830 --> 06:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
time sometimes than we realize so i
 
06:38:39.910 --> 06:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
cannot support removing this requirement
 
06:38:42.628 --> 06:38:42.638 align:start position:0%
at this point in time
 
06:38:44.868 --> 06:38:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh
 
06:38:44.878 --> 06:38:47.590 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh
representative

06:38:47.590 --> 06:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:38:49.030 --> 06:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much one of those rare
 
06:38:50.628 --> 06:38:50.638 align:start position:0%
places where marsh and canurk actually
 
06:38:53.430 --> 06:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
disagree but in any case
 
06:38:56.310 --> 06:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
when this did come through though uh
 
06:38:56.320 --> 06:38:57.350 align:start position:0%
when this did come through though uh
last

06:38:57.350 --> 06:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
last
 
06:38:57.360 --> 06:38:58.310 align:start position:0%
last
year

06:38:58.310 --> 06:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:39:00.868 --> 06:39:00.878 align:start position:0%
i did not support the bill to just
 
06:39:03.270 --> 06:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
repeal and that is because i shared
 
06:39:04.708 --> 06:39:04.718 align:start position:0%
representative marsha's feelings and
 
06:39:06.708 --> 06:39:06.718 align:start position:0%
that is we made a deal we needed to
 
06:39:08.868 --> 06:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
honor that deal because i had been you
 
06:39:12.628 --> 06:39:12.638 align:start position:0%
know part of that agreement as well
 
06:39:12.638 --> 06:39:13.590 align:start position:0%
know part of that agreement as well
but

06:39:13.590 --> 06:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:39:16.070 --> 06:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
things have changed and that is why i've
 
06:39:17.990 --> 06:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
actually changed my mind about it first
 
06:39:18.948 --> 06:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
of all we know that the majority of
 
06:39:21.510 --> 06:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
people on medicaid already work anyway
 
06:39:23.830 --> 06:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
secondly is we saw the shambles of
 
06:39:25.590 --> 06:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
trying to begin to enforce it in this
 
06:39:27.670 --> 06:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
state where we spent a lot of money and
 
06:39:29.590 --> 06:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
were unable to even begin to get things
 
06:39:31.910 --> 06:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
organized to do it and we have seen the
 
06:39:34.788 --> 06:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
effects in other states the bill that i
 
06:39:36.468 --> 06:39:36.478 align:start position:0%
actually supported back when this came
 
06:39:37.830 --> 06:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
up the last time
 
06:39:37.840 --> 06:39:38.948 align:start position:0%
up the last time
um

06:39:38.948 --> 06:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:41.510 --> 06:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
was actually it was two years ago was a
 
06:39:41.520 --> 06:39:42.868 align:start position:0%
was actually it was two years ago was a
bill

06:39:42.868 --> 06:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:39:45.830 --> 06:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
which was it was sb 290 which was a had
 
06:39:47.270 --> 06:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
a metric that if a certain number of
 
06:39:48.948 --> 06:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
people lost insurance that it would
 
06:39:50.628 --> 06:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
suspend it and that was
 
06:39:52.390 --> 06:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
you know kind of a stop gap and sort of
 
06:39:56.070 --> 06:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
halfway between just repealing it and uh
 
06:39:58.150 --> 06:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
and letting it go forward it was a kind
 
06:39:59.270 --> 06:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
of a
 
06:40:01.670 --> 06:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
harms limitation the thing is we've now
 
06:40:04.150 --> 06:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
seen the disaster of trying to enforce
 
06:40:06.708 --> 06:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
it we've seen the results in the other
 
06:40:08.468 --> 06:40:08.478 align:start position:0%
states we've seen people lose their
 
06:40:10.468 --> 06:40:10.478 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage and with all that in
 
06:40:12.548 --> 06:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
mind and no compelling data that this it
 
06:40:14.230 --> 06:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
was actually going to improve people's
 
06:40:16.230 --> 06:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
health but actually more importantly we
 
06:40:17.590 --> 06:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
need to keep people healthy to be able
 
06:40:19.110 --> 06:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
to be at work
 
06:40:21.030 --> 06:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
i have changed my mind from my
 
06:40:23.270 --> 06:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
opposition to just repeal two years ago
 
06:40:25.430 --> 06:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
and i now do support repealing but it's
 
06:40:30.468 --> 06:40:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:31.830 --> 06:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
06:40:34.390 --> 06:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
um representative weber
 
06:40:37.030 --> 06:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative weber please thank you mr
 
06:40:40.230 --> 06:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
chairman i i just want to second the
 
06:40:43.350 --> 06:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
piece of representative knurk's
 
06:40:47.270 --> 06:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
testimony which was that the enforcement
 
06:40:50.868 --> 06:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
phase of this was very expensive
 
06:40:52.468 --> 06:40:52.478 align:start position:0%
and was
 
06:40:55.590 --> 06:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
a complete disaster
 
06:40:58.788 --> 06:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
and it required the removal of workers
 
06:41:01.590 --> 06:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
from other areas that they were working
 
06:41:04.548 --> 06:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
in to go and search for people
 
06:41:07.190 --> 06:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
to find out whether they were meeting
 
06:41:10.230 --> 06:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
their work requirement or not so it had
 
06:41:13.670 --> 06:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
consequences far beyond this particular
 
06:41:16.070 --> 06:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
bill and i will end with that but i will
 
06:41:17.910 --> 06:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
let you know mr chairman that both
 
06:41:20.390 --> 06:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative acton and representative
 
06:41:22.708 --> 06:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
shapiro have their hands up
 
06:41:24.390 --> 06:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weber
 
06:41:29.030 --> 06:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:29.040 --> 06:41:32.948 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:41:32.948 --> 06:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:32.958 --> 06:41:34.230 align:start position:0%
 
i

06:41:34.230 --> 06:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:41:37.990 --> 06:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
i was originally um
 
06:41:40.548 --> 06:41:40.558 align:start position:0%
again against removing this um
 
06:41:42.150 --> 06:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
and i've just i've been doing a lot of
 
06:41:43.990 --> 06:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
soul searching on this one
 
06:41:46.628 --> 06:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
um i've lived in in poverty in my life
 
06:41:48.390 --> 06:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't
 
06:41:50.788 --> 06:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
ages gone by it was fairly recently
 
06:41:52.390 --> 06:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
where we
 
06:41:54.310 --> 06:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
my family almost lost everything and we
 
06:41:55.670 --> 06:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
would have been in the situation where
 
06:41:57.350 --> 06:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
we needed to go on medicaid and one
 
06:41:58.948 --> 06:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
thing i realized one thing i learned is
 
06:41:58.958 --> 06:42:00.788 align:start position:0%
thing i realized one thing i learned is
that

06:42:00.788 --> 06:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:42:04.390 --> 06:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
being broke is a is hard work i
 
06:42:05.590 --> 06:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
i couldn't
 
06:42:07.990 --> 06:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i had to do everything i could
 
06:42:09.990 --> 06:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
just to keep the household together i we
 
06:42:11.670 --> 06:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
were so broke at one point i had to go
 
06:42:13.830 --> 06:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
and fill a five gallon diesel jug to
 
06:42:15.990 --> 06:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
pour in the heating oil
 
06:42:18.468 --> 06:42:18.478 align:start position:0%
i just scam up 20 bucks to fill the jug
 
06:42:20.628 --> 06:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
and and that would be enough to get us
 
06:42:22.310 --> 06:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
through a couple days it did the whole
 
06:42:22.320 --> 06:42:23.590 align:start position:0%
through a couple days it did the whole
winter

06:42:23.590 --> 06:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
winter
 
06:42:23.600 --> 06:42:24.390 align:start position:0%
winter
um

06:42:24.390 --> 06:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:27.670 --> 06:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
so i so i you know i i've been through
 
06:42:30.230 --> 06:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
that and
 
06:42:32.468 --> 06:42:32.478 align:start position:0%
the other the other issue i have is that
 
06:42:34.150 --> 06:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
um i think we
 
06:42:36.788 --> 06:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
we we've fallen into into a rut here
 
06:42:38.150 --> 06:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
with with
 
06:42:40.868 --> 06:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
medicaid where where we assume that we
 
06:42:42.548 --> 06:42:42.558 align:start position:0%
have this assumption that everyone's
 
06:42:45.270 --> 06:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
just sitting home doing nothing and just
 
06:42:46.548 --> 06:42:46.558 align:start position:0%
in collecting
 
06:42:47.990 --> 06:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i just don't think that i think
 
06:42:50.468 --> 06:42:50.478 align:start position:0%
that's a myth and i i think it's time to
 
06:42:53.190 --> 06:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
move beyond that
 
06:42:53.200 --> 06:42:54.070 align:start position:0%
move beyond that
uh

06:42:54.070 --> 06:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:42:56.548 --> 06:42:56.558 align:start position:0%
secondly um or thirdly
 
06:42:56.558 --> 06:42:57.270 align:start position:0%
secondly um or thirdly
um

06:42:57.270 --> 06:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:59.350 --> 06:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:43:00.548 --> 06:43:00.558 align:start position:0%
we're not just going to pull out of
 
06:43:04.230 --> 06:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
coving this is going to be years
 
06:43:06.868 --> 06:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
the economy is severely damaged
 
06:43:10.070 --> 06:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
and there there's not many jobs
 
06:43:12.788 --> 06:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
um we may we may go into it may take
 
06:43:15.670 --> 06:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
years and years of of layoffs and
 
06:43:18.708 --> 06:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
we got a foreclosure crisis coming
 
06:43:18.718 --> 06:43:19.670 align:start position:0%
we got a foreclosure crisis coming
um

06:43:19.670 --> 06:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:22.548 --> 06:43:22.558 align:start position:0%
people are are going to need
 
06:43:25.030 --> 06:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid and i i don't like the program
 
06:43:26.948 --> 06:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
i wish i could rewrite the whole thing
 
06:43:29.430 --> 06:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
but it's what we have right now i can't
 
06:43:29.440 --> 06:43:30.310 align:start position:0%
but it's what we have right now i can't
vote

06:43:30.310 --> 06:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
vote
 
06:43:32.390 --> 06:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
to throw people off of
 
06:43:35.590 --> 06:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
medicaid healthcare
 
06:43:35.600 --> 06:43:36.788 align:start position:0%
medicaid healthcare
believing

06:43:36.788 --> 06:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
believing
 
06:43:38.628 --> 06:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
what i believe is going to happen to
 
06:43:39.910 --> 06:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
this country in the next couple years
 
06:43:41.430 --> 06:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
which is a severe
 
06:43:41.440 --> 06:43:43.270 align:start position:0%
which is a severe
recession

06:43:43.270 --> 06:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
recession
 
06:43:44.628 --> 06:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
06:43:47.670 --> 06:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's it i'm going to vote um
 
06:43:47.680 --> 06:43:49.030 align:start position:0%
that's it i'm going to vote um
accordingly

06:43:49.030 --> 06:43:49.040 align:start position:0%

medicaid she could hold a regular job
 
06:44:17.830 --> 06:44:17.840 align:start position:0%

uh when people are ill
 
06:45:13.670 --> 06:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
and handicapped
 
06:45:15.670 --> 06:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't that mean that they don't have
 
06:45:22.708 --> 06:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:24.468 --> 06:45:24.478 align:start position:0%
who is that address to
 
06:45:26.468 --> 06:45:26.478 align:start position:0%
anybody who knows the answer because
 
06:45:29.270 --> 06:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
this just sounds strange to say that
 
06:45:32.310 --> 06:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
it's an excuse not to require working
 
06:45:35.990 --> 06:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
if somebody i could answer that mr chair
 
06:45:38.150 --> 06:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
if that's helpful
 
06:45:40.548 --> 06:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
and his handicap i mean that's a form of
 
06:45:40.558 --> 06:45:42.230 align:start position:0%
and his handicap i mean that's a form of
handicap

06:45:42.230 --> 06:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
handicap
 
06:45:44.548 --> 06:45:44.558 align:start position:0%
represent yes representative weber if
 
06:45:45.990 --> 06:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
you wish
 
06:45:48.070 --> 06:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
there are a number of exceptions in the
 
06:45:49.670 --> 06:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
rule um
 
06:45:52.788 --> 06:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
and and some of those are
 
06:45:54.868 --> 06:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
very early child care and i can't
 
06:45:57.110 --> 06:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
remember when that goes up to
 
06:45:59.190 --> 06:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
and there are some
 
06:46:01.030 --> 06:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions for
 
06:46:03.670 --> 06:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
medical reasons um
 
06:46:06.150 --> 06:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
both both
 
06:46:06.160 --> 06:46:07.270 align:start position:0%
both both
both

06:46:07.270 --> 06:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
both
 
06:46:10.708 --> 06:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
physical and uh behavioral
 
06:46:10.718 --> 06:46:13.030 align:start position:0%
physical and uh behavioral
but

06:46:13.030 --> 06:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:13.040 --> 06:46:14.548 align:start position:0%
 
for

06:46:14.548 --> 06:46:14.558 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:46:16.788 --> 06:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people who are on the
 
06:46:19.750 --> 06:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
border lines of that um
 
06:46:23.750 --> 06:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
and so no it was contemplated when the
 
06:46:25.670 --> 06:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
statute was passed that there were
 
06:46:28.070 --> 06:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
certain categories of people who simply
 
06:46:29.830 --> 06:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't go to work and that was
 
06:46:29.840 --> 06:46:31.590 align:start position:0%
couldn't go to work and that was
recognized

06:46:31.590 --> 06:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
06:46:34.788 --> 06:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
the issue is all of the people
 
06:46:36.948 --> 06:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
who are sort of sneaking up to that
 
06:46:39.510 --> 06:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
borderline and they are also the very
 
06:46:41.830 --> 06:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
people who have a great deal of
 
06:46:44.310 --> 06:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
difficulty organizing themselves well
 
06:46:46.468 --> 06:46:46.478 align:start position:0%
enough to fill out the paperwork to
 
06:46:50.150 --> 06:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
justify or verify what they have or have
 
06:46:51.670 --> 06:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
not done to
 
06:46:54.468 --> 06:46:54.478 align:start position:0%
complete the requirements so
 
06:46:56.310 --> 06:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
there are some provisions in the bill
 
06:46:58.150 --> 06:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's not everybody who has to work but
 
06:47:00.708 --> 06:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
there are gaps as well
 
06:47:03.110 --> 06:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
and i will let the chair know that the
 
06:47:05.350 --> 06:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
hands that i see now and i've lost all
 
06:47:07.590 --> 06:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
control over the order
 
06:47:07.600 --> 06:47:08.628 align:start position:0%
control over the order
are

06:47:08.628 --> 06:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:47:10.868 --> 06:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro representative
 
06:47:15.110 --> 06:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:18.310 --> 06:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
i um while you are giving what i thought
 
06:47:19.830 --> 06:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
was a very
 
06:47:22.468 --> 06:47:22.478 align:start position:0%
fair answer to the question i was trying
 
06:47:24.310 --> 06:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
to keep the order and representative
 
06:47:29.030 --> 06:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:30.948 --> 06:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman
 
06:47:30.958 --> 06:47:32.230 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman
um

06:47:32.230 --> 06:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:33.990 --> 06:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
several people have mentioned the amount
 
06:47:36.468 --> 06:47:36.478 align:start position:0%
of money that it cost trying to roll out
 
06:47:38.548 --> 06:47:38.558 align:start position:0%
the program a couple of years ago and so
 
06:47:39.510 --> 06:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'll just
 
06:47:40.628 --> 06:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
say that
 
06:47:40.638 --> 06:47:41.510 align:start position:0%
say that
the

06:47:41.510 --> 06:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:47:43.430 --> 06:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
federal government accounting office
 
06:47:47.270 --> 06:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
said that 4.4 million dollars were spent
 
06:47:49.270 --> 06:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
most of it in federal money
 
06:47:50.788 --> 06:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
a little bit less than two hundred
 
06:47:53.270 --> 06:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in new hampshire
 
06:47:54.548 --> 06:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
state money
 
06:47:56.708 --> 06:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
was spent trying to roll out the program
 
06:47:58.788 --> 06:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
that didn't get rolled out
 
06:48:01.430 --> 06:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
i would like to
 
06:48:03.990 --> 06:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
address the issue that representative
 
06:48:06.468 --> 06:48:06.478 align:start position:0%
marsh brought up about on this going
 
06:48:09.350 --> 06:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
back on an agreement that was made
 
06:48:11.910 --> 06:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm very sensitive to that issue i
 
06:48:14.390 --> 06:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
feel like in a sense he's correct
 
06:48:17.110 --> 06:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
i would say that for myself when i first
 
06:48:18.548 --> 06:48:18.558 align:start position:0%
was elected
 
06:48:20.230 --> 06:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
and this
 
06:48:22.510 --> 06:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
a similar bill was brought up i think in
 
06:48:26.788 --> 06:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
2019 it was brought up by a also newly
 
06:48:29.110 --> 06:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
elected representative and
 
06:48:31.030 --> 06:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things i remember her saying
 
06:48:33.030 --> 06:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
when she introduced the bill to repeal
 
06:48:35.670 --> 06:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
the work requirement
 
06:48:37.430 --> 06:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
was that
 
06:48:39.350 --> 06:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
she had not been in the legislature when
 
06:48:41.510 --> 06:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
the deal was made and therefore she was
 
06:48:43.670 --> 06:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
not a party to the deal and that she
 
06:48:46.230 --> 06:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
didn't have to um go by it
 
06:48:46.240 --> 06:48:47.270 align:start position:0%
didn't have to um go by it
um

06:48:47.270 --> 06:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:49.430 --> 06:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
i disagreed
 
06:48:51.990 --> 06:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
my my sentiments were really different i
 
06:48:54.468 --> 06:48:54.478 align:start position:0%
had a hard time with that i felt a deal
 
06:48:56.708 --> 06:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
was a deal whether i made it or whether
 
06:48:58.070 --> 06:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
i didn't make it
 
06:48:58.080 --> 06:48:59.670 align:start position:0%
i didn't make it
um

06:48:59.670 --> 06:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:02.150 --> 06:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm sensitive to the idea that some
 
06:49:05.110 --> 06:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
people might feel that we're changing an
 
06:49:05.120 --> 06:49:07.030 align:start position:0%
people might feel that we're changing an
agreement

06:49:07.030 --> 06:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
06:49:09.510 --> 06:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
i feel that we're changing an agreement
 
06:49:12.150 --> 06:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
because the circumstances have changed
 
06:49:13.880 --> 06:49:13.890 align:start position:0%
so dramatically
 
06:49:13.890 --> 06:49:15.270 align:start position:0%
so dramatically
[Music]

06:49:15.270 --> 06:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:49:16.628 --> 06:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
not because
 
06:49:18.310 --> 06:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
we had the majority the democrats had
 
06:49:20.230 --> 06:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
the majority like we did the last two
 
06:49:22.390 --> 06:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
years or not because we can just bring
 
06:49:25.510 --> 06:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
up any bill we want i really think the
 
06:49:29.350 --> 06:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances are dramatically different
 
06:49:33.670 --> 06:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:33.680 --> 06:49:34.788 align:start position:0%
 
for

06:49:34.788 --> 06:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:49:35.990 --> 06:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
representatives who were on the
 
06:49:36.000 --> 06:49:37.190 align:start position:0%
representatives who were on the
committee

06:49:37.190 --> 06:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:49:39.030 --> 06:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
the last term
 
06:49:41.190 --> 06:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
know that i have a daughter
 
06:49:43.910 --> 06:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
with stage four cancer
 
06:49:43.920 --> 06:49:45.030 align:start position:0%
with stage four cancer
and

06:49:45.030 --> 06:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:49:47.190 --> 06:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
that has changed my feelings
 
06:49:47.200 --> 06:49:48.628 align:start position:0%
that has changed my feelings
dramatically

06:49:48.628 --> 06:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
06:49:50.468 --> 06:49:50.478 align:start position:0%
about the idea of someone having
 
06:49:53.110 --> 06:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
insurance or not having insurance
 
06:49:56.548 --> 06:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
and the idea that we would take people
 
06:49:59.190 --> 06:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
off their insurance especially people
 
06:50:01.070 --> 06:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
who have a difficult time
 
06:50:01.080 --> 06:50:02.628 align:start position:0%
who have a difficult time
negotiating

06:50:02.628 --> 06:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
negotiating
 
06:50:05.270 --> 06:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
getting insurance
 
06:50:06.868 --> 06:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
is just something i think we shouldn't
 
06:50:06.878 --> 06:50:08.868 align:start position:0%
is just something i think we shouldn't
do

06:50:08.868 --> 06:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:50:08.878 --> 06:50:10.150 align:start position:0%
do
so

06:50:10.150 --> 06:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:50:12.788 --> 06:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
i would ask all of you to rethink this
 
06:50:14.628 --> 06:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
idea about
 
06:50:17.670 --> 06:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
a compromise made or a deal made
 
06:50:19.670 --> 06:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
and try to think of this from the point
 
06:50:20.948 --> 06:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
of view
 
06:50:22.468 --> 06:50:22.478 align:start position:0%
of a family
 
06:50:24.548 --> 06:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
or an individual
 
06:50:27.110 --> 06:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
who has to face a serious illness
 
06:50:30.390 --> 06:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:32.230 --> 06:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative

i did not have my hand up mr chairman

thank you mr chairman
 
06:50:51.030 --> 06:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
a question to someone on the committee
 
06:50:51.040 --> 06:50:52.628 align:start position:0%
a question to someone on the committee
could

06:50:52.628 --> 06:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
could
 
06:50:54.468 --> 06:50:54.478 align:start position:0%
looking for what percentage of the
 
06:50:57.110 --> 06:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
population we're talking about now that
 
06:50:58.948 --> 06:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
is not working that's causing the
 
06:51:01.190 --> 06:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
problem is it is it a large percent just
 
06:51:02.948 --> 06:51:02.958 align:start position:0%
one question the other one
 
06:51:05.030 --> 06:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
information wise is how much this
 
06:51:06.468 --> 06:51:06.478 align:start position:0%
program is paid by the federal
 
06:51:08.468 --> 06:51:08.478 align:start position:0%
government versus the state government
 
06:51:10.070 --> 06:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to understand the financial
 
06:51:12.390 --> 06:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
side of the equation because it is only
 
06:51:13.990 --> 06:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
three or four percent of the population
 
06:51:16.310 --> 06:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
out there that's really at risk of
 
06:51:16.320 --> 06:51:17.830 align:start position:0%
out there that's really at risk of
enforcement

06:51:17.830 --> 06:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
06:51:19.350 --> 06:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
that's one thing versus saying 30
 
06:51:21.110 --> 06:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
percent and the other of course is how
 
06:51:22.868 --> 06:51:22.878 align:start position:0%
much money the state's putting into the
 
06:51:26.948 --> 06:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:29.270 --> 06:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
can anyone answer that
 
06:51:31.590 --> 06:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
part of that representative shapiro can
 
06:51:33.110 --> 06:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
probably answer part of it
 
06:51:37.830 --> 06:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:40.230 --> 06:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
yes i'm not sure when we're talking
 
06:51:42.150 --> 06:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
about cost i'm not sure if we're talking
 
06:51:44.708 --> 06:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
about cost of insurance or cost of
 
06:51:44.718 --> 06:51:45.830 align:start position:0%
about cost of insurance or cost of
running

06:51:45.830 --> 06:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
running
 
06:51:45.840 --> 06:51:47.670 align:start position:0%
running
the

06:51:47.670 --> 06:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:51:49.830 --> 06:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
work requirement program
 
06:51:51.990 --> 06:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of the insurance in terms of
 
06:51:55.990 --> 06:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:56.000 --> 06:51:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
90

06:51:57.030 --> 06:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
90
 
06:51:59.430 --> 06:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
of the cost of
 
06:52:01.830 --> 06:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid is borne by the
 
06:52:03.750 --> 06:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
federal government 10 percent by the
 
06:52:03.760 --> 06:52:04.868 align:start position:0%
federal government 10 percent by the
state

06:52:04.868 --> 06:52:04.878 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:52:04.878 --> 06:52:07.030 align:start position:0%
state
um

06:52:07.030 --> 06:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:52:09.350 --> 06:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
06:52:11.350 --> 06:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of rolling out a work
 
06:52:14.868 --> 06:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
requirement and running that program
 
06:52:16.788 --> 06:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
i just know from
 
06:52:18.468 --> 06:52:18.478 align:start position:0%
you know past information that the
 
06:52:20.150 --> 06:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
federal government paid for a lot of
 
06:52:20.160 --> 06:52:21.030 align:start position:0%
federal government paid for a lot of
that

06:52:21.030 --> 06:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:52:23.190 --> 06:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
i don't assume that they would be
 
06:52:26.070 --> 06:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for for paying
 
06:52:27.990 --> 06:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
for that
 
06:52:30.070 --> 06:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
i assume that it would come out of the
 
06:52:33.590 --> 06:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
budget of health and human services
 
06:52:35.110 --> 06:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
if i could just
 
06:52:37.990 --> 06:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
add something to that um representative
 
06:52:40.310 --> 06:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
snow representative wood is next and
 
06:52:42.468 --> 06:52:42.478 align:start position:0%
i'll put you on the list
 
06:52:44.230 --> 06:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i may
 
06:52:46.708 --> 06:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
yes sir follow up follow up
 
06:52:48.628 --> 06:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
to uh representative superior thank you
 
06:52:50.310 --> 06:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
for the information
 
06:52:51.750 --> 06:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
in regards to the
 
06:52:53.430 --> 06:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
other question
 
06:52:54.948 --> 06:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the population
 
06:52:57.110 --> 06:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
covered through this program
 
06:52:59.350 --> 06:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
is a questionable
 
06:53:00.948 --> 06:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
amount that needs to be enforced as far
 
06:53:02.948 --> 06:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
as the work requirement is it a small
 
06:53:04.390 --> 06:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
percentage of the pie are we talking
 
06:53:06.628 --> 06:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
about a large percentage because
 
06:53:08.070 --> 06:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at saying there's only three
 
06:53:10.230 --> 06:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
percent of the population that's really
 
06:53:12.390 --> 06:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
a foul the work requirement is that kind
 
06:53:13.750 --> 06:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
of what we're talking about or is it
 
06:53:15.590 --> 06:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
greater than that it's more like 30 40
 
06:53:15.600 --> 06:53:16.708 align:start position:0%
greater than that it's more like 30 40
percent

06:53:16.708 --> 06:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:53:18.788 --> 06:53:18.798 align:start position:0%
where are we in that spectrum
 
06:53:18.798 --> 06:53:19.670 align:start position:0%
where are we in that spectrum
um

06:53:19.670 --> 06:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:19.680 --> 06:53:20.468 align:start position:0%
um
i

06:53:20.468 --> 06:53:20.478 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:53:21.670 --> 06:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
i could
 
06:53:23.590 --> 06:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
speak to that or
 
06:53:26.390 --> 06:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:30.230 --> 06:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
or anybody wants to speak to that
 
06:53:32.230 --> 06:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
this is representative weber and i
 
06:53:34.468 --> 06:53:34.478 align:start position:0%
noticed that representative knight is
 
06:53:36.948 --> 06:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
also waving his hand
 
06:53:39.510 --> 06:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
my recollection from the last time we
 
06:53:41.670 --> 06:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
went through this was that there was a
 
06:53:44.468 --> 06:53:44.478 align:start position:0%
concern that there were about 17 000
 
06:53:46.390 --> 06:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
people who were at risk
 
06:53:49.190 --> 06:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm not a hundred percent certain of
 
06:53:51.430 --> 06:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
that so if somebody else had
 
06:53:55.350 --> 06:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
better information i would yield to them
 
06:53:57.190 --> 06:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
i i believe
 
06:54:00.070 --> 06:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
i believe that there were
 
06:54:00.080 --> 06:54:02.708 align:start position:0%
i believe that there were
um

06:54:02.708 --> 06:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:05.190 --> 06:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
over 50 000 people on the expanded
 
06:54:07.190 --> 06:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid program but that has been
 
06:54:09.430 --> 06:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
inflated with covid and with people
 
06:54:11.270 --> 06:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
losing their employee-based health
 
06:54:13.590 --> 06:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
insurance and now it's up to
 
06:54:13.600 --> 06:54:14.708 align:start position:0%
insurance and now it's up to
um

06:54:14.708 --> 06:54:14.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:17.270 --> 06:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
in the mid 60 thousands
 
06:54:19.110 --> 06:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
and if you remember correctly we talked
 
06:54:21.430 --> 06:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
about that with a dental benefit because
 
06:54:23.990 --> 06:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
they wanted to wait till covid
 
06:54:27.030 --> 06:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
resolved somewhat because the cost of
 
06:54:29.510 --> 06:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
implementing that program they expect to
 
06:54:31.510 --> 06:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
be less eventually
 
06:54:34.230 --> 06:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm not really sure
 
06:54:34.240 --> 06:54:35.030 align:start position:0%
so i'm not really sure
as

06:54:35.030 --> 06:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:54:37.510 --> 06:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative weber said before
 
06:54:39.270 --> 06:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
there are
 
06:54:41.430 --> 06:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
a number of exceptions to the work
 
06:54:43.750 --> 06:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
program that people can get waivers from
 
06:54:45.750 --> 06:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
the work program that people can get who
 
06:54:48.310 --> 06:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
are on expanded medicaid i don't know
 
06:54:51.830 --> 06:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
what percentage that represents of the
 
06:54:55.030 --> 06:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
over 60 000 people that are
 
06:54:57.830 --> 06:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
that receive expanded medicaid right now
 
06:55:00.070 --> 06:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
and representative knurk i think also
 
06:55:02.708 --> 06:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
had um an addition to that
 
06:55:04.628 --> 06:55:04.638 align:start position:0%
yes i mean i think here's the the issue
 
06:55:06.468 --> 06:55:06.478 align:start position:0%
is that we heard the testimony back
 
06:55:09.750 --> 06:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
before that it was roughly about 75
 
06:55:11.350 --> 06:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
percent of people on medicaid work
 
06:55:13.430 --> 06:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
anyway so we're looking at maybe about
 
06:55:15.590 --> 06:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
25 percent the number of people on
 
06:55:17.590 --> 06:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
medicaid is i think and this is real
 
06:55:19.030 --> 06:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
back of the envelope but somewhere about
 
06:55:21.670 --> 06:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
150 000 or you know if you look at it
 
06:55:21.680 --> 06:55:22.390 align:start position:0%
150 000 or you know if you look at it
about

06:55:22.390 --> 06:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:55:24.230 --> 06:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know ten percent of the
 
06:55:26.390 --> 06:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
population so if you have a quarter or
 
06:55:27.990 --> 06:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
ten percent we are indeed looking at
 
06:55:29.190 --> 06:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
about two to three percent of the
 
06:55:31.510 --> 06:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
population but then with the exemptions
 
06:55:33.270 --> 06:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
that gets us down to representative
 
06:55:34.788 --> 06:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
weber's comment because if you have
 
06:55:37.590 --> 06:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
about 17 000 out of the one and a half
 
06:55:39.430 --> 06:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
million we have roughly you're talking
 
06:55:41.990 --> 06:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
about a percent so we are talking about
 
06:55:43.590 --> 06:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
a very small number of people and that
 
06:55:45.270 --> 06:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
was one of the questions is
 
06:55:47.910 --> 06:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
is it worth the amount of enforcement uh
 
06:55:50.230 --> 06:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
money that would be done to try to do
 
06:55:51.670 --> 06:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
this to actually achieve anything and
 
06:55:52.708 --> 06:55:52.718 align:start position:0%
would we
 
06:55:54.708 --> 06:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
i would actually circle back to
 
06:55:56.468 --> 06:55:56.478 align:start position:0%
representative gay's question
 
06:55:58.948 --> 06:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
in this in sb 313
 
06:56:00.070 --> 06:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's important to realize that went
 
06:56:02.708 --> 06:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
through hhsea first representative marsh
 
06:56:04.230 --> 06:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
edwards and kinorks sat down and came up
 
06:56:06.708 --> 06:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
with 10 different amendments for the
 
06:56:08.628 --> 06:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
program and these were had to do a lot
 
06:56:10.230 --> 06:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
of them with her exemptions
 
06:56:12.468 --> 06:56:12.478 align:start position:0%
we actually passed in five of them went
 
06:56:13.990 --> 06:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
through the house the first committee
 
06:56:15.430 --> 06:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
finance of course and their ultimate
 
06:56:15.440 --> 06:56:16.468 align:start position:0%
finance of course and their ultimate
wisdom

06:56:16.468 --> 06:56:16.478 align:start position:0%
wisdom
 
06:56:17.990 --> 06:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
totally went back to the original bill
 
06:56:19.590 --> 06:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
and got rid of all of our policy
 
06:56:21.750 --> 06:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations so none of those got in
 
06:56:23.990 --> 06:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
there as a result what we're left with
 
06:56:26.310 --> 06:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
just out of curiosity is it is a
 
06:56:28.548 --> 06:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
caretaker of a child under age six as
 
06:56:30.628 --> 06:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
exempted that means your seven-year-old
 
06:56:32.548 --> 06:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
can be home alone
 
06:56:34.390 --> 06:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
that doesn't usually work well for most
 
06:56:34.400 --> 06:56:35.750 align:start position:0%
that doesn't usually work well for most
people

06:56:35.750 --> 06:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:56:38.788 --> 06:56:38.798 align:start position:0%
likewise the uh
 
06:56:41.030 --> 06:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
the way that it's worded does not work
 
06:56:43.030 --> 06:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
well for seasonal employees we have
 
06:56:44.548 --> 06:56:44.558 align:start position:0%
people up in my neck of the woods that
 
06:56:45.430 --> 06:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
work for
 
06:56:47.270 --> 06:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know 80 hours a week for a couple of
 
06:56:49.190 --> 06:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
months in the summer um doing
 
06:56:51.030 --> 06:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
landscaping and then work running lifts
 
06:56:52.070 --> 06:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
for a couple of months but have a few
 
06:56:53.350 --> 06:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
months they don't they're going to be
 
06:56:56.390 --> 06:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
then going into and out of the program
 
06:56:58.310 --> 06:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
back and forth and back and forth and
 
06:57:00.628 --> 06:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
that is very disruptive to medical care
 
06:57:02.230 --> 06:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
and it increases the administrative
 
06:57:04.868 --> 06:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
costs uh so these were all things that
 
06:57:07.270 --> 06:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
again martian edwards and kirk dealt
 
06:57:09.350 --> 06:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
with and put in his amendments but got
 
06:57:11.430 --> 06:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
lost as the bill went through finance
 
06:57:13.990 --> 06:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
and then ultimately was passed so there
 
06:57:16.070 --> 06:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
are some exemptions but some of them are
 
06:57:17.350 --> 06:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
a little strange i think most of us
 
06:57:18.948 --> 06:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't leave our seven-year-olds home
 
06:57:18.958 --> 06:57:20.468 align:start position:0%
wouldn't leave our seven-year-olds home
alone

06:57:20.468 --> 06:57:20.478 align:start position:0%
alone
 
06:57:22.708 --> 06:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
i would like to move towards closure on
 
06:57:25.270 --> 06:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
this we do have representative wood
 
06:57:27.590 --> 06:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
who had his hand up
 
06:57:29.830 --> 06:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
just very briefly uh just to
 
06:57:31.350 --> 06:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
make my uh
 
06:57:33.030 --> 06:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh position known
 
06:57:35.670 --> 06:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh i too uh felt this was a commitment
 
06:57:39.190 --> 06:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
and before i was uh in the legislature i
 
06:57:42.150 --> 06:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
worked through the medical society to
 
06:57:44.230 --> 06:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
get this passed uh with the
 
06:57:45.990 --> 06:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that there was a a
 
06:57:46.000 --> 06:57:47.590 align:start position:0%
understanding that there was a a
compromise

06:57:47.590 --> 06:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
06:57:49.270 --> 06:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh by the same token has been pointed
 
06:57:51.910 --> 06:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
out this the situation is dramatically
 
06:57:51.920 --> 06:57:52.868 align:start position:0%
out this the situation is dramatically
changed

06:57:52.868 --> 06:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
changed
 
06:57:54.868 --> 06:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
uh and as commissioner myers at that
 
06:57:58.230 --> 06:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
time said the implementation is just a a
 
06:58:00.150 --> 06:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
headache as we've pointed out
 
06:58:01.830 --> 06:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
and just to get a little bit into the
 
06:58:04.628 --> 06:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
weeds on that you had to re renew it
 
06:58:05.750 --> 06:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
every month
 
06:58:07.830 --> 06:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
and some people who don't know how to
 
06:58:10.230 --> 06:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
get online and couldn't get the phone
 
06:58:10.240 --> 06:58:11.590 align:start position:0%
get online and couldn't get the phone
number

06:58:11.590 --> 06:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
number
 
06:58:13.110 --> 06:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't get it so they were then kicked
 
06:58:13.120 --> 06:58:14.230 align:start position:0%
couldn't get it so they were then kicked
off

06:58:14.230 --> 06:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
off
 
06:58:15.670 --> 06:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
which really
 
06:58:15.680 --> 06:58:16.548 align:start position:0%
which really
was

06:58:16.548 --> 06:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:58:18.070 --> 06:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
a complete antithesis of the whole
 
06:58:18.080 --> 06:58:19.110 align:start position:0%
a complete antithesis of the whole
program

06:58:19.110 --> 06:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:58:21.110 --> 06:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
and just from an overview
 
06:58:22.948 --> 06:58:22.958 align:start position:0%
the whole concept
 
06:58:25.350 --> 06:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
is is is a little bit fallacious from
 
06:58:27.350 --> 06:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
the standpoint of medicine
 
06:58:30.468 --> 06:58:30.478 align:start position:0%
medicine is meant to make you healthy
 
06:58:32.230 --> 06:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
so you can work
 
06:58:33.990 --> 06:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
not make you work
 
06:58:36.230 --> 06:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
so you can get health care
 
06:58:39.030 --> 06:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's just the reverse
 
06:58:39.910 --> 06:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:58:41.350 --> 06:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative and
 
06:58:43.990 --> 06:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative we have representatives
 
06:58:46.150 --> 06:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
with the hand up representative as i was
 
06:58:49.350 --> 06:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
saying representative has snow is called
 
06:58:50.830 --> 06:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
on oh i'm
 
06:58:53.990 --> 06:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
sorry yes thank you mr chairman just to
 
06:58:55.350 --> 06:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
expand a little bit on what
 
06:58:57.750 --> 06:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro said the typical
 
06:59:00.468 --> 06:59:00.478 align:start position:0%
federal state split for
 
06:59:00.478 --> 06:59:01.750 align:start position:0%
federal state split for
medicaid

06:59:01.750 --> 06:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
06:59:03.430 --> 06:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
other than the new innovative programs
 
06:59:05.590 --> 06:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
is a 50-50 split 50
 
06:59:07.590 --> 06:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
federal 50 state
 
06:59:09.430 --> 06:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
under the expanded medicaid he is
 
06:59:11.670 --> 06:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
correct that some of the programs is a
 
06:59:13.990 --> 06:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
90 federal 10
 
06:59:16.948 --> 06:59:16.958 align:start position:0%
spread and how much all of that is worth
 
06:59:18.628 --> 06:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
i don't have that information in front
 
06:59:20.628 --> 06:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
of me i would also just like to say it
 
06:59:22.468 --> 06:59:22.478 align:start position:0%
seems to me that this bill is sort of
 
06:59:22.478 --> 06:59:23.990 align:start position:0%
seems to me that this bill is sort of
backwards

06:59:23.990 --> 06:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
backwards
 
06:59:25.670 --> 06:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
when i was working in mental health i
 
06:59:28.150 --> 06:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
started a large sheltered workshop and
 
06:59:30.788 --> 06:59:30.798 align:start position:0%
also a supported employment program
 
06:59:33.270 --> 06:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
using the regular competitive job market
 
06:59:35.750 --> 06:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
to place patients to work and one of the
 
06:59:37.350 --> 06:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
things that we discovered rather quickly
 
06:59:39.510 --> 06:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
is when you got people jobs even in a
 
06:59:41.510 --> 06:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
sheltered environment
 
06:59:43.190 --> 06:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
their medicaid would cover them until
 
06:59:44.868 --> 06:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
they earned a certain amount of money
 
06:59:47.270 --> 06:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
and suddenly they were cut off
 
06:59:50.070 --> 06:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
and i thought the sensible way to deal
 
06:59:51.910 --> 06:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
with that is if they reached a certain
 
06:59:53.990 --> 06:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
level and moved ahead and were doing
 
06:59:54.000 --> 06:59:55.110 align:start position:0%
level and moved ahead and were doing
well

06:59:55.110 --> 06:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:59:58.310 --> 06:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
don't cut them off instead keep them on
 
07:00:01.750 --> 07:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
and begin to charge a graduated uh
 
07:00:05.030 --> 07:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
fee or premium for them to stay on which
 
07:00:06.468 --> 07:00:06.478 align:start position:0%
made a lot of sense and they actually
 
07:00:07.830 --> 07:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
did it as a trial though i don't know
 
07:00:09.430 --> 07:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
whatever happened for that trial because
 
07:00:11.830 --> 07:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
i've since retired but the the fact of
 
07:00:14.070 --> 07:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
the matter is that gets people used to
 
07:00:15.830 --> 07:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
the idea that is insurance is not
 
07:00:17.670 --> 07:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
something that they give you
 
07:00:19.990 --> 07:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
insurance is something that you earn
 
07:00:21.590 --> 07:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
now that's not done
 
07:00:23.510 --> 07:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
but the opposite of that is to take
 
07:00:25.590 --> 07:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
people's insurance away because they
 
07:00:27.830 --> 07:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
haven't met some other standard and just
 
07:00:29.670 --> 07:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
to give you a little idea
 
07:00:32.390 --> 07:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
if people are involved in
 
07:00:34.150 --> 07:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
community activities of one kind or
 
07:00:35.510 --> 07:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
another if they're in some kind of a
 
07:00:37.670 --> 07:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
treatment or training program
 
07:00:39.750 --> 07:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
the training programs that automatically
 
07:00:42.230 --> 07:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
lead to employment and so forth you can
 
07:00:44.948 --> 07:00:44.958 align:start position:0%
get around this community but you know a
 
07:00:47.750 --> 07:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
lot of the people that are on medicaid
 
07:00:49.430 --> 07:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to listen to a lot of this
 
07:00:50.708 --> 07:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the reasons they had
 
07:00:52.788 --> 07:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
so much trouble with trying to roll this
 
07:00:54.548 --> 07:00:54.558 align:start position:0%
program out because you're talking about
 
07:00:56.390 --> 07:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
people that have never been treated
 
07:00:59.190 --> 07:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
particularly well by the system
 
07:01:02.150 --> 07:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
takes care of them to me it's ridiculous
 
07:01:03.670 --> 07:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
to threaten people with the medicaid
 
07:01:05.750 --> 07:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
being taken away and if this goes out of
 
07:01:06.948 --> 07:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
the way we're going to see lots of
 
07:01:09.190 --> 07:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
people dropped off the rolls and it
 
07:01:11.030 --> 07:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
makes that's inhumane as far as i'm
 
07:01:13.270 --> 07:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
concerned so i'm strongly in favor of
 
07:01:16.230 --> 07:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
this particular bill and
 
07:01:19.270 --> 07:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
anyway i'll apply it at this point
 
07:01:21.590 --> 07:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative snow
 
07:01:23.830 --> 07:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
for myself
 
07:01:26.868 --> 07:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
all my adult life i've been to some
 
07:01:29.350 --> 07:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
degree or other responsible
 
07:01:31.350 --> 07:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
for people
 
07:01:34.948 --> 07:01:34.958 align:start position:0%
many of whom have had serious genuine
 
07:01:34.958 --> 07:01:36.390 align:start position:0%
many of whom have had serious genuine
needs

07:01:36.390 --> 07:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
needs
 
07:01:38.948 --> 07:01:38.958 align:start position:0%
but i lay alongside that
 
07:01:40.708 --> 07:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
numbers of working class people that
 
07:01:43.990 --> 07:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
i've known and many in my district today
 
07:01:44.000 --> 07:01:45.590 align:start position:0%
i've known and many in my district today
who

07:01:45.590 --> 07:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
who
 
07:01:47.270 --> 07:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
are having to
 
07:01:49.510 --> 07:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
pick up an extra shift or work a second
 
07:01:49.520 --> 07:01:50.548 align:start position:0%
pick up an extra shift or work a second
job

07:01:50.548 --> 07:01:50.558 align:start position:0%
job
 
07:01:53.430 --> 07:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
and who can tell me and point to me
 
07:01:55.190 --> 07:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
people who could work
 
07:01:57.350 --> 07:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
but are not working and are getting a
 
07:01:57.360 --> 07:01:58.548 align:start position:0%
but are not working and are getting a
check

07:01:58.548 --> 07:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
check
 
07:02:01.350 --> 07:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
i had a family member
 
07:02:03.910 --> 07:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
exactly like that she could have worked
 
07:02:06.310 --> 07:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
she should have worked if she wasn't a
 
07:02:08.468 --> 07:02:08.478 align:start position:0%
relative i would have turned her in
 
07:02:10.468 --> 07:02:10.478 align:start position:0%
and she got her check and refused to
 
07:02:10.478 --> 07:02:11.510 align:start position:0%
and she got her check and refused to
work

07:02:11.510 --> 07:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
work
 
07:02:14.788 --> 07:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
and what this does to many people who
 
07:02:16.868 --> 07:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
are just getting by
 
07:02:18.788 --> 07:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
is compassion
 
07:02:18.798 --> 07:02:19.990 align:start position:0%
is compassion
fatigue

07:02:19.990 --> 07:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
fatigue
 
07:02:21.910 --> 07:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
they've cared a lot about people but
 
07:02:24.150 --> 07:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
there's a point at which they stop
 
07:02:26.390 --> 07:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
because this is what they see
 
07:02:30.628 --> 07:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
and i understand their concern as well
 
07:02:32.628 --> 07:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
i do know that there are numbers of
 
07:02:36.150 --> 07:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
safety nets and waivers in this program
 
07:02:39.510 --> 07:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'm conflicted this there's different
 
07:02:42.230 --> 07:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
i vote one way i'm affirming one part of
 
07:02:44.788 --> 07:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
who i am and violating another i vote
 
07:02:46.468 --> 07:02:46.478 align:start position:0%
the other way i'm doing the same in
 
07:02:49.830 --> 07:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
reverse but i just wanted to bring this
 
07:02:52.310 --> 07:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
part of it up that there's people out
 
07:02:54.788 --> 07:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
there right now who um
 
07:02:57.430 --> 07:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
who are angry i am trying to encourage
 
07:02:59.990 --> 07:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
them in the various compassion things i
 
07:03:02.548 --> 07:03:02.558 align:start position:0%
put forward and when they see somebody
 
07:03:05.270 --> 07:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
who could work but won't work it makes
 
07:03:08.310 --> 07:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
my job to do this very difficult
 
07:03:08.320 --> 07:03:09.350 align:start position:0%
my job to do this very difficult
um

07:03:09.350 --> 07:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:03:11.270 --> 07:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to speak
 
07:03:13.830 --> 07:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
for the first time because we need to if
 
07:03:16.310 --> 07:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
you've spoken before you've had i think
 
07:03:18.868 --> 07:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
you've had you say but uh is this
 
07:03:22.788 --> 07:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
anybody who hasn't spoken and wishes to
 
07:03:25.510 --> 07:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
see no further hands mr chairman thank
 
07:03:27.510 --> 07:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
you and i want to be very sensitive to
 
07:03:29.350 --> 07:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
the fourth floor they are very
 
07:03:31.350 --> 07:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
short-handed today and they've been

at the second column
 
07:08:10.708 --> 07:08:10.718 align:start position:0%
the second column is the due date and
 
07:08:13.910 --> 07:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
most of them are march 11th but some of
 
07:08:15.510 --> 07:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
them you will find the due date is
 
07:08:18.548 --> 07:08:18.558 align:start position:0%
