thank you senate bill 310 whoa
um

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
is uh dealing with license plate
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
scanners and uh
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor came and spoke to us
 
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.710 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor came and spoke to us
primarily

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
primarily
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
as a result of
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
one person as far as we know although
 
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
in reading the bill it would seem that
 
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.350 align:start position:0%
in reading the bill it would seem that
there

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
must be other people that would
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
would also be in the same situation
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
but we are have
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
no knowledge from the bill's language
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
whether that is the case
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
the only change the bill
 
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.190 align:start position:0%
the only change the bill
makes

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
makes
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise is to
 
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.950 align:start position:0%
otherwise is to
allow

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
a license plate reader to be installed
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
or mounted in a vehicle that is attended
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
to and operated by a law enforcement
 
00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.190 align:start position:0%
to and operated by a law enforcement
officer

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
officer
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
aside from that there's a new section
 
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.310 align:start position:0%
aside from that there's a new section
that

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
that would allow a private property
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
owner to
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
to have a license plate reader for the
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
sole purpose of gaining entry to
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
vehicles whose owners have owners have
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
contracted individually with the
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
property owner to have their license
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
la goodlawn never comes from one
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
one person one industry so um for that
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
those reasons i think we would
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%

we have seen
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
similar attempts
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the past to allow um scanning of
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
drivers licenses
 
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.070 align:start position:0%
drivers licenses
and

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
retention of the information
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
and some of the concerns that we have
 
00:32:17.679 --> 00:32:19.269 align:start position:0%
and some of the concerns that we have
seen

00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:20.389 align:start position:0%
seen
is

00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
privacy issues
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
issues that may conflict with our
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
constitution regards to the right to
 
00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.870 align:start position:0%
constitution regards to the right to
privacy

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.070 align:start position:0%
privacy
um

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.350 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
in particular with this bill i believe
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
we discovered that the
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
rather broad definitions uh for who
 
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
would have access to this information
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
was quite concerning
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
quote health care business purposes
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
extremely broad we had testimony that it
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
could be a hospital a doctor's office
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
cvs walmart
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
i just have extreme
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
issues with the fact that that
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
information would be available
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
without any limitation on what that
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
actually is
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
we also had concerns about the fact that
 
00:33:04.159 --> 00:33:06.389 align:start position:0%
we also had concerns about the fact that
um

00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
in the section on motor vehicle business
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
purposes there was no consequence if the
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
holder of the driver's license refused
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
to allow scanning
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
i had a problem with that and i think we
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
also when we came right out and asked
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
how much
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
identity fraud is happening in our state
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
um it was
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
not as rampant as we would have thought
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
that we should
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
move on such an extreme change to our
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
current statute which protects
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh the privacy of our individuals so
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%

00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%

listening to testimony on this
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
particular bill one of the things that
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
struck me is that you know this these
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
mobile garages
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
are to provide convenience for new
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
and these garages tend to be around the
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
large employers
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
since they had a one of those mobile
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
garages here i happen to go down and you
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
know kind of look in and i actually
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
walked in them
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
and it looked you know fairly
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh stable it seemed
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
very worthy in terms of the repairs that
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
they do
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
and to add state vehicle inspections i
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
thought i think is
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
um worthy for new hampshire citizens to
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
allow for the convenience and based on
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
all that
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
i think uh you know otpness and allowing
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
this for the convenience of the citizens
 
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire is a good thing
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
hope that we are finally going to get
 
00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:07.990 align:start position:0%

this

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
done for the people for the citizens of
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so that they have
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
a way to
 
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
get their cars inspected with less
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
impact than having to take a day out of

work for instance
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%

other
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
staff members and it is a
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisan effort on
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
those from the other side of the wall as
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
we often say
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
and accordingly i would think that this
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
is a good thing for us to do for
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
making it a little easier for people who
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
take their drivers at elsewhere and
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
give the
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
dmv the authority to
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
establish those standards
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
for drivers at
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you sir everybody anybody else
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none the only thing i'll add is
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh roman two of part two of the bill
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
actually is a service to our citizens uh
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
we learned in public hearing that
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
actually the definitions of a lot of the
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
violations in other states are more
 
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
severe than ours and so this will allow
 
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
the the commissioner to interpret
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
and compare what those uh violations are
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
in other states and apply them to what
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
is codified in new hampshire law so this
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
is a good thing and a good good clear
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
for clarifier
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%

representative sykes
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so this
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
um part of my concern about this bill
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
was that first off the secretary of
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
state's office did not offer any
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
testimony on the day of the bill and
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
that is always concerning to me when a
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
big part of the questions raised by this
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
bill concerns that department
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
so i it's i think it's incumbent upon us
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
to recognize that um i'm also concerned
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
that it might in fact violate the new
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
the new part of our state constitution
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
looking for protections of privacy which
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
i don't want to call it the prime
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
directive of this committee but this
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
committee has always been in support of
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
protecting persons privacy and
 
00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.069 align:start position:0%
protecting persons privacy and
accordingly

00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
i would urge members of the committee to
 
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:12.790 align:start position:0%
i would urge members of the committee to
vote

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%

questions about this bill

that the only way that we could get done
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of making this
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
viable would be to go interim study and
 
01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
really do a good interim study and get
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%

01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
um even though i've been a uh
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill i will i would
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
urge my colleagues to support the
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%

seeing none i i will echo that um of all
 
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
the bills we had here i have to be
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
honest this is the one we worked on the
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
hardest we had meetings with the
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh with the senator with the farm bureau
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
and i think there is something we can
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
get to that does give some relief to
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
them but it seems every time we get an
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
answer on one issue we came up with a
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
question on another um and just looking
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
at the deadlines
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh i'm grateful we could agree
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
and this will not be a death with
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
dignity this will be a legitimate
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
interim study and i i believe it's the
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
right way to go forward with this and i
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
ask everybody on the committee
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%

the amendment is very simple
 
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
it just strikes line four of the
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
original bill and i'd like to just uh
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
give you some of the reasons why i
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
the organization that's listed didn't
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
show up to our hearing
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
and upon looking at the senate hearing
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
notes they didn't show up to the senate
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
as we know and we learned a few weeks
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
ago we have received feedback from an
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
organization that is part of the decal
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
program has been in the program for a
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
little over three years now
 
01:27:59.830 --> 01:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
and there are relatively small
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
organization but they said it was the
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
biggest mistake they've ever made as a
 
01:28:03.199 --> 01:28:04.550 align:start position:0%
biggest mistake they've ever made as a
nonprofit

01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
nonprofit
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
they did not fully understand the
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
financial um implication of what they
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
had to put into the program
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
and in the end um they discovered that
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
it has now cost them 1200
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
they're in the whole 1200 and they've
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
sold only 12 decals
 
01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.310 align:start position:0%
sold only 12 decals
um

01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
and they wish they had never done it
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
they didn't fully understand it
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
i brought this forward to the committee
 
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
a couple months ago and i
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
said i think it's our place to make sure
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
that these organizations fully
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
understand the program what they're
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
getting into and have them
 
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
agree that they know what they're
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
getting into we know that the program
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
works for certain organizations
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
some of the larger ones it's great i
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
think that the
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
girl scouts of the white mountains that
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
we passed earlier i think that they will
 
01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.590 align:start position:0%
we passed earlier i think that they will
really

01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
excel with the program and i'm happy
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
that that one's gone through
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
we've seen the university system has
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
also flourished with the program it
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
works for large organizations
 
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
i think it would be unfair for us to
 
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
just push
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
one through without
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
being assured that they understand what
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
they're getting into
 
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
they can always come back in the future
 
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
would like to think that we're doing
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
a good thing by giving them a chance to
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
understand what they're getting into
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
before sinking uh
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
you know much needed money that they use
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
into a program like this
 
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:34.480 align:start position:0%

01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative talarsky pretty much
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
summarized it all in regards to
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
a certain organization not showing up
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
and really not knowing what's going on
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
what what the cost would be for all this
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
therefore the uh
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
the ought to pass as amended would be
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
the better way to go which authorizes
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire towing association
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%

original bill after the amendment uh
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
this also
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
allows the towing association to
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
issue decals that will give some
 
01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
recognition to our move over law so that
 
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
is a good thing

to your motion
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
uh sure uh i served on the
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
electric charging vehicle infrastructure
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
commission for a few years
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
um that was an outcrop of
 
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we could spend
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
the volkswagen trust fund settlement
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
money on
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of progress was made
 
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
corridors were established but this is a
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
program that's in its infancy
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
until we see how some of that works out
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
and we start getting data back on the
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
cost benefit the impact on electric
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
rates it doesn't make sense to me to do
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
this sort of
 
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
massive expansion of a program that
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
hasn't been proven yet
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
so not against the concept and this is a
 
01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
bill i might vote for in five years but
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you sir anybody from the committee
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:57.669 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
so

01:34:57.669 --> 01:34:57.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:57.679 --> 01:35:00.390 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
this is a concept whose time has come
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
if you imagine such an american icon
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle as the corvette will be
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
fully electric shortly
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
that cummins diesel is changing all of
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
their truck their engines to
 
01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:20.470 align:start position:0%
their truck their engines to
electric

01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
electric
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
and we
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
i have spoken again and again and again
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
about how
 
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
we as a state need to be prepared for
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
things as they are
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
when they arrived not oh they're here
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
now what are we going to do about it it
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
we're prepared for the arrival of the of
 
01:35:38.239 --> 01:35:39.270 align:start position:0%
we're prepared for the arrival of the of
this

01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
new industry with jobs
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
changing the way we do things i
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
characterize it as being
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
sort of like back in the days when
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
decisions were being made about where to
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
put the new interstate
 
01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:57.750 align:start position:0%
put the new interstate
system

01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
and there were winners and losers in
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
program and i will speak to my area of
 
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
the state particularly
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
um the interstate went through lebanon
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
and it didn't go through claremont even
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
though claremont was a larger city at
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that city of claremont has
 
01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
gone through some exceptionally
 
01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
difficult times and their population
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
continues to go down
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
at least until very recently whereas
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
lebanon's continues to go up
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
with with a really low unemployment rate
 
01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.550 align:start position:0%
with with a really low unemployment rate
etc

01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
etc
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
we should be preparing to make sure that
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
our state is one of the winners in this
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
and it is time for us to have a
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
mechanism to
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
funding sources that already exist
 
01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
federal money
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
vw money there's a whole bunch of them
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
um i would urge the committee the
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to vote against
 
01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:03.270 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to vote against
the

01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
itl because there is a amendment that
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
would improve the bill
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
that we would be prepared to offer um
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
if we get it not to pass
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
so again
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's time to
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
wake up and smell the coffee let's just
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
say this these electric vehicles are
 
01:37:23.119 --> 01:37:24.229 align:start position:0%
say this these electric vehicles are
coming

01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
and we need to be set up as a state in
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
order to
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh best do what the
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan um i agree
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
well first of all if this truly is
 
01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:44.470 align:start position:0%
well first of all if this truly is
premature

01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
premature
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
there's not much harm in passing it
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
because there won't be any
 
01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
funds to put in the uh either give
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
directly to drt or put in this fund
 
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
depending what form the bill passes in
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
so there's no harm into it but there is
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
in fact a lot of interest a lot of money
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
this is the wave of the future of
 
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
normally the corvette is going electric
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
even the ford f-150 is going electric um
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
that most traditionally fuel guzzling of
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
all vehicles so this is uh
 
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
and uh especially
 
01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.790 align:start position:0%
and uh especially
um

01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
those other states with higher taxes
 
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
where our tourists come from they're
 
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
investing heavily in
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
electric charging vehicles for their
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
tourist traffic i noticed for example
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
last summer i was down in
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
lee massachusetts which is right near
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
the new york massachusetts state line
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
and they've
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
set up about
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
20 electric charging stations at the
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
right off the first exit off of the
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
massachusetts turnpike and so those
 
01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
those people can charge up and almost
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
make it to new hampshire but they may be
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
worried about how much farther they can
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
go in new hampshire and actually
 
01:38:47.679 --> 01:38:50.149 align:start position:0%
go in new hampshire and actually
ironically

01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
ironically
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
this makes especially a big difference
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle chargers are
 
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle owners are not quite sure if
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
there'll be any place for them to charge
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
it if they get up to you know sugar hill
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
or berlin or any of the other
 
01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:05.679 align:start position:0%
communities in northern new hampshire
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
have a lot to offer so i think this is
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
something that is very much very much
 
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
needed um there's
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
a burgeoning demand for it i um
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
i was we had an electric vehicle uh
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
showcase in new hampshire and i'm i mean
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
i personally still drive a volvo what
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
they call an ice engine internal
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
combustion so i'm driving a gas guzzler
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
but there's um
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
a wide variety of people who are very
 
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about their uh
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
about their electric vehicles not just
 
01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
the hybrids but also the all-electric
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
vehicles and so i think
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
i think we need to pass this bill
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
immediately so dot and the other
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
agencies can get to work in this right
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
away rather than waiting five years or
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
even waiting until
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh the end of the 2023 budget cycle so i
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
would certainly urge us to
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
get on the stick and pass
 
01:39:56.239 --> 01:39:57.510 align:start position:0%
get on the stick and pass
either

01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
preferably the amended bill or failing
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
that the original bill so i would say
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
i say this is not premature this is
 
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
actually overdue and um so we
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know we need we need to get started
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh before the leaf peeping season two we
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
want to make sure those leaf peepers
 
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
from massachusetts new york can get
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
all the way up to the north country and
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
back without uh
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
without running out of electricity so
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
i i say past this thanks
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative i'll be very brief i just
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
want to um
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
emphasize that
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
not having this program
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
in place to manage these monies we heard
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
in testimony that
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
having this bill in place will help us
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
when we apply for grants and different
 
01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.270 align:start position:0%
when we apply for grants and different
funds

01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
we've already heard with the previous
 
01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
bill that new hampshire's
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
behind the times behind the eight ball
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
we can't even get electric vehicles into
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
the state to sell
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
this is just gonna put us one step more
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
than one step behind
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
all of the other states that are going
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
to be advancing this technology it makes
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
us look like we're living in the dark
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
age and i would encourage
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
we'll leave it there we could go on for
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
hours on this debate
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%

another one besides my mind no that
 
01:42:53.109 --> 01:42:53.119 align:start position:0%

01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
then i don't i guess i don't have one
 
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
after all
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
um anyways i'll speak to my motion when
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
it's time
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
a point of order mr chair where is that
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative wrong um
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that amendment can
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
be introduced from anyone it doesn't
 
01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
have to be from the person that
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
sponsored the amendment
 
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:20.719 align:start position:0%
is that that is that not the case in
 
01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
this committee that is true
 
01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:24.470 align:start position:0%
this committee that is true
okay

01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
so can represent so my understanding is
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
that even though representative sykes
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
didn't sponsor the amendment that he
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
could still move it to the committee
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
let me hold on one second for some
 
01:43:34.639 --> 01:45:56.229 align:start position:0%
let me hold on one second for some
clarification

01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
why not get foreign right that's where
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's the direction we're gonna go um
 
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
just for clarification uh after
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
consulting a few uh i did get the
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
amendment drafted i do not want to see
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment going to go forward with
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
my name on it uh so therefore i'm not
 
01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
gonna entertain it being introduced in
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
terms of the language being used which
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
is fine for somebody else to introduce
 
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
we just don't have time today so the
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
best option would be uh we'll go through
 
01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
the vote on the ought to pass and if
 
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's successful or whatever the outcome
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
this could be introduced as a floor
 
01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:29.030 align:start position:0%
this could be introduced as a floor
amendment

01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
the the the change is basically in the
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
first section and believe it or not the
 
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh department of transportation didn't
 
01:46:38.229 --> 01:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
even recognize this until the 11th hour
 
01:46:38.239 --> 01:46:39.830 align:start position:0%
even recognize this until the 11th hour
either

01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
they were fine with it because the
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal note was uh indeterminal
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
indeterminable um
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
so the amendment
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh i i will no longer support moving
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
this forward with my name on it so
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
that's where we're at so we're not going
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
to be taking up this amendment the
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is ought to pass any
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
more on the ought to pass motion
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
well i just i will say mr chairman that
 
01:47:05.189 --> 01:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
i disagree with the
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
tactics that are taking place here i
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
we have an obligation to do when we get
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
informate further information as uh
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
things come across that would improve a
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
bill that we're trying to vote on that
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
we should take steps
 
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
in a cleaner process here now today
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
i understand though that you are chair
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
and there we are yep and time is time
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
that is the major reason for my decision
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh anything else on the out to pass
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'll just reiterate again this is a very
 
01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:39.030 align:start position:0%
i'll just reiterate again this is a very
um

01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
this can't be
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that dot will have to
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
deal with anyway in this either version
 
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
build and make it give them a lot more
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
flexibility this isn't something we want
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
to put out for five years it isn't
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
really even something we want to put off
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
until uh you know
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
the spring of 2023 whenever the next
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
legislature passes this new budget and
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
goes through all that rigmarole so i
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
think this um
 
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
enables them to get to work now and
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
certainly um
 
01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
those other states we like to make fun
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
of with their high taxes liberal
 
01:48:11.590 --> 01:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
policies their uh drivers are
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
are by switching to electric vehicles in
 
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
large number and they expect our state
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
like other states to have a adequate
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in place to support them
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
so just so just urge committee to pass
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
you know at least the original bill
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you anybody else from the
 
01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.310 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you anybody else from the
committee

01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you mr chairman
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
um i support the otp i'm amazed that
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
people think this is uh not ready for
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
prime time because
 
01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles are all over the place
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
i mean if you go down starting in
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
virginia and work your way north they're
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
growing and growing we are not prepared
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
i look at the traffic in the lakes
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
region in the summer and it's going to
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
really hurt us with tourism if we don't
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
have the infrastructure to allow people
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
with electric vehicles to be able to
 
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.669 align:start position:0%
with electric vehicles to be able to
recharge

01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
recharge
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
i echo my colleague from durham's
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
remarks about
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
that our tourism industry is going to
 
01:49:10.229 --> 01:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
rely on this infrastructure to be in
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
place and we cannot wait anymore the
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
time is now thank you
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative sykes i'll give you one
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
more thank you sir um
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
just as another
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
point being illustrative that this is
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
not too early
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
the upper valley
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
will have electric buses
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
in operation before the end of
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
next year they're already purchased and
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
they're gonna
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
this is coming folks
 
01:49:47.109 --> 01:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair all that aside i mean
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about spending state money
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
and government money on doing this and i
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
think the issue of the approach is
 
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
probably what we disagree with more
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
we you put in a tourist attraction
 
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
you also put in bathrooms because people
 
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
are not likely to go spend the day
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
someplace that does not have a bathroom
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
you may have a concession stand because
 
01:50:15.589 --> 01:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
if you want them to stay there for six
 
01:50:17.589 --> 01:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
hours they'll get hungry if they're
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
driving an electric car i would imagine
 
01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
that these places would then put in
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
charges if they want to attract that and
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
then use it as a marketing device and
 
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go back to the point where
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's early to begin subsidizing
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
this i prefer to see how the industry
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:38.390 align:start position:0%
 
amen

01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
amen
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
he just defused me which is probably a
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
representative pilerski i am going to be
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
so very quick
 
01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
i simply want to react to what was just
 
01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:52.790 align:start position:0%
i simply want to react to what was just
stated

01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
stated
 
01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:54.709 align:start position:0%
stated
and

01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
while i don't
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
the first statement made on this is
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
having state funds
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
spent i was frantically looking through
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
my bill here to see where that actually
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
states that i believe i understood
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
my colleague was then saying that we
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
would have to build bathrooms and
 
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
concession stands
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
i guess i will then just take the very
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
quick leap
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
because he's talking about attracting
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
more people up here
 
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
if i misunderstood i apologize
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
to me that sounded like
 
01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
growing business
 
01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
growing dollars
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
people spending money
 
01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
which is i thought what we were trying
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
to encourage here
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
and that's what i believe
 
01:51:39.990 --> 01:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
does by drawing people in so that they
 
01:51:44.229 --> 01:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
can come and spend money and i apologize
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
if i totally misunderstood what was just
 
01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:49.910 align:start position:0%
if i totally misunderstood what was just
said

01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the community
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative smith thank you yeah yeah
 
01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
the point was
 
01:52:02.070 --> 01:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
that the state or the federal government
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
didn't pay for the bathrooms they didn't
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
pay for the concessions concession
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
stands and at this point i don't know if
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
we need to pay for the electric charges
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
or create this sort of
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and i don't know
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
potential bureaucracy because the
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
businesses might do it all by themselves
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
if they think it's a good draw
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
and i do agree with that
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
in premise first of all i don't know if
 
01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
if the manufacturers are moving towards
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles because everybody
 
01:52:32.709 --> 01:52:32.719 align:start position:0%
wants them i don't believe that to be
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
true i believe they're moving towards
 
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles because they're being
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
compelled to
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh when we get to the infrastructure of
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
it i was all fine with taking the
 
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
volkswagen trust fund money and using
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
that towards creating the corridors
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
um but when you get to us or even the
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
federal money with its taxpayer money
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
also actually spending the money on the
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to recharge personals
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
individual vehicles doesn't make any
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
sense to me you see tesla chargers all
 
01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
over the planet so why don't we see ford
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
and gm and all these other ones
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
why aren't they bringing the money into
 
01:53:06.629 --> 01:53:06.639 align:start position:0%
the situation why is it the taxpayers
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
that have to build the infrastructure
 
01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
another possibility that happens is we
 
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
spend all this money all these millions
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
of dollars in in five years and the
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
batteries improve so much that half the
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we put in is no longer
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
necessary these are all the things that
 
01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:20.070 align:start position:0%
necessary these are all the things that
do

01:53:20.070 --> 01:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
legitimize the statement that we're not
 
01:53:24.149 --> 01:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
ready for this yet um so i please
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
encourage everybody to vote against the
 
01:53:27.189 --> 01:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
01:53:28.639 --> 01:53:29.750 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
representative

01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'll just be quick um when we just had a
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
clarification from the representative
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
from the department of transportation
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
that this bill as amended would allow
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
the state would allow the dot to
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
contract with private
 
01:53:43.990 --> 01:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
entities to come in and build this
 
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
doing it themselves and it is my
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
understanding that would also be
 
01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:52.950 align:start position:0%
understanding that would also be
allowing

01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
paid charges i mean this isn't all just
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
for us putting up chargers with free
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
electricity going to vehicles um so i
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
guess we will probably continue to agree
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and i appreciate you giving
 
01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
me more than enough opportunities to
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
speak thank you
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
i would stop i would not stop being fair
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
on our last day here so
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
um and again it's not about
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
nobody disagrees that ultimately people
 
01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
are going to have to pay for the
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
electricity that comes out of these
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
charging systems but there's we're still
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
being looked at as being spending
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money on the infrastructure
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
itself now if every charge
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
had a surcharge that went towards paying
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
for the infrastructure and made it
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
almost like a bond i'd look at this a
 
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
whole lot differently but that's not
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
what it does uh so you're right i think
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
we're probably going to disagree i
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
cnn i'll ask the clerk to call the rule
 
01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:48.629 align:start position:0%
cnn i'll ask the clerk to call the rule
on

01:54:48.629 --> 01:54:48.639 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:54:54.550 --> 01:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on senate bill 447 fn
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative smith no
 
01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
workboats no representative hill no
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative thompson no

o'brien no
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative clutier yes
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
representative fenton yeah
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan yes
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative rich
 
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative talersky yes
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative fox yes representative
 
01:55:29.669 --> 01:55:29.679 align:start position:0%
stevens yes representative wrong yes
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
chairman walsh
 
01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:32.790 align:start position:0%
chairman walsh
no

01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
nine to nine
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay nine to nine on the out to pass
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
that follows the nine to nine on the itl
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
so i recognize the impasse we're at uh
 
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
again uh some may think it's unfair we
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
just do not have the time to entertain
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
any amendments
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh they can be done on the floor uh i am
 
01:55:52.229 --> 01:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
going to close the executive session on
 
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
this this will go to the calendar
 
01:55:56.790 --> 01:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
without recommendation the motion on the
 
01:55:58.229 --> 01:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
floor when we get there will be out to
 
01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
pass and we can have this discussion all
 
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
so before we all leave
 
01:56:15.589 --> 01:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh well you got a hearing
 
01:56:15.599 --> 01:56:16.870 align:start position:0%
uh well you got a hearing
okay

01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
before we do leave um
 
01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:19.830 align:start position:0%
before we do leave um
i

01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
the deadline is the 28th if you've got
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
reports uh please get them to me today
 
01:56:26.709 --> 01:56:26.719 align:start position:0%
it is really enough i've got a couple of
 
01:56:30.070 --> 01:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
do myself um but before we do go i want
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
to thank everybody i can't believe
 
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
even though we had to end on this note
 
01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:35.990 align:start position:0%
even though we had to end on this note
um

01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
that this is the last day of our
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
committee work for this term i think you
 
01:56:40.390 --> 01:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
can all agree it's been a very
 
01:56:41.669 --> 01:56:41.679 align:start position:0%
interesting one
 
01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
can't believe that it was almost a year
 
01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
and a half ago when i walked in this
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
room with my brand new laptop saying
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
what the heck is zoom
 
01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:49.990 align:start position:0%
what the heck is zoom
so

01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's been quite a haul
 
01:56:54.149 --> 01:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
um again i want to thank everybody i
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative o'hara for
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
being my my aide during the initial zoom
 
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
days because i had no idea what i was
 
01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:01.189 align:start position:0%
days because i had no idea what i was
doing

01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
um but i
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
again too just want to express that i
 
01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:05.910 align:start position:0%
again too just want to express that i
hope

01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
hope
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh and i did do my best to hold up the
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
traditions of the transportation
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
committee through this whole process
 
01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
we still had some fun we had some laughs
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
we got our work done
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
and even though we don't agree on
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
everything it's
 
01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's how you disagree that makes the
 
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
difference and i think we were able to
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
get through our work disagree
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
forget it shrug it off with no grudges
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
take on the next one and again i want to
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for well thank you all of that
 
01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:36.550 align:start position:0%
thank you for well thank you all of that
here

01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
do we have any senate messages yet do
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for reminding me i have not
 
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
got the official senate message but the
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
only amended bill we have
 
01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh and i'll get the message and and
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
respond to it was the
 
01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
railroad bill uh representative
 
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
o'brien's all they did was change some
 
01:57:55.589 --> 01:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
pronouns they didn't change anything in
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
the bill so
 
01:57:58.950 --> 01:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh being relieved that the pronouns are
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
now correct i would imagine we'll concur
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
with the changes
 
01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:04.229 align:start position:0%
with the changes
so

01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh but when i do see um i did get a side
 
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
by side you know brad if you could email
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee the side by
 
01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
side on that uh that way i can just get
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
a yes or no when they do actually see it
 
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh that's the only one i've gotten so
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
far i have been paying attention to the
 
01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:19.350 align:start position:0%
far i have been paying attention to the
senate

01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's the only one i know so far that
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
they've actually amended
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
so they've either been passing or
 
01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:24.709 align:start position:0%
so they've either been passing or
killing

01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
killing
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's how it goes
 
01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:27.270 align:start position:0%
that's how it goes
so

01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
with that if nobody else has anything
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
yeah okay representative sykes so i
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
would like to echo the chairman's words
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
has a history of working together to try
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
and come up with the best solutions
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
we almost always find our way there once
 
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
in a while we don't
 
01:58:47.589 --> 01:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's been my experience that we've
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
we have been able to disagree and not be
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
disagreeable and i think that's
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
really important and i look forward to
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
further work with members of this
 
01:58:59.040 --> 01:58:59.990 align:start position:0%
further work with members of this
committee

01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
in the next session
 
01:59:05.589 --> 01:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for that anybody else
 
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
being done we'll see you next session
 
01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
you
