there's not much to report today since
 
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
we did the last update just about a
 
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
month ago uh but I'll make a few brief
 
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
comments uh starting with the New
 
00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 align:start position:0%
Hampshire commission for human rights we
 
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
sent the commission a draft report on uh
 
00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 align:start position:0%
April 9th we'll be meeting with the
 
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
commission next week to answer any
 
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
questions they have on the
 
00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
report there's a monthly commission
 
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
meeting scheduled Ed for June 6th where
 
00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
the members will discuss the draft
 
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
responses to the
 
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
report and it looks like a July fiscal
 
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
committee meeting is the earliest
 
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
possible time that we'd be able to
 
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
present the
 
00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 align:start position:0%
report moving on to the state oversight
 
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
of special
 
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
education uh there are no changes to
 
00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
report on this audit uh work is still in
 
00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.430 align:start position:0%
report on this audit uh work is still in
process

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
here moving on to the education Freedom
 
00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
accounts since last met we continued
 
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
discussions with the Department on how
 
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 align:start position:0%
best to move forward with the audit and
 
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
we will continue to have discussions
 
00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 align:start position:0%
with the Department on this and as a
 
00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 align:start position:0%
result we're not prepared to present the
 
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
today and that is it
 
00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 align:start position:0%
for current status any questions from
 
00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:55.670 align:start position:0%
for current status any questions from
the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
committee do you do you have a sense of
 
00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:00.439 align:start position:0%
timing on
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
when you will um have more updates on
 
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
special ed or the EFA
 
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
audits special education we probably
 
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
won't have another update on that for a
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
while uh I think our plan at this point
 
00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 align:start position:0%
is try to try and get a uh chapter of
 
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
observations over to the department and
 
00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
um we're still working through that
 
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
right now uh I haven't reviewed that
 
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
work and um that should come in the next
 
00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
couple months I would think well a
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
chapter within a month yes um so that's
 
00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 align:start position:0%
for special education and um on the
 
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts um I don't
 
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
have a great estimate on when the scope
 
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
statement will be ready um how about you
 
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
Jay I I think once we get uh this
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to finish their review
 
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
of the the uh contractor uh Within a
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
month or so so that would give us
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
something to look at so I think at that
 
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
point we'll probably have a scope
 
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
statement after that great yes and you
 
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
say they are looking at the contractor
 
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the department of
 
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
Ed is looking at their contractor
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
they're doing a review and then that
 
00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
summary of that review presented to you
 
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
for your analysis and yes thank
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
Weber just a quick technical question
 
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
when you said that a chapter of our
 
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
observations is going over uh to the um
 
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
Department what what do you mean when
 
00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
you say a chapter is that a partial a
 
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
part of the entire audit so yes it is
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
yeah that'll be a lengthy report so
 
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
we're we're talking about um presenting
 
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
that to the department in chapters okay
 
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
um just so that we can have the process
 
00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 align:start position:0%
moving along instead of giving them a
 
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
whole report at the end with okay with
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
really really a lot to uh to take in so
 
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
so bite-sized chunks bite-sized
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
chunks as I Rec call you had told us
 
00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
there was going to be a thick oned with
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
40 or so
 
00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
observations yes that's correct okay so
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal will have some something to
 
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
digest yes okay any other questions on
 
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
the status
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
great okay let's move on to suspended
 
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
table and potential oned topics I
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
think you
 
00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
all pro yes does everybody have
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
this great so there's public access to
 
00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 align:start position:0%
bodies of water the doorway program the
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
appeals process they're number of them
 
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
oplc Bureau of Jan Adult Services

followup letter
from

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
I Education team yes
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
bye from um some members of house
 
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
Judiciary um in support of moving
 
00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:40.879 align:start position:0%
forward on a performance on of the
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
different appeals
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
processes I know if everyone's had a
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
chance to look at that could you tell us
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
how many audits you could take on right
 
00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
now right now um we could take on just
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
one okay um so if we could get at least
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
one Topic at a minimum today um a couple
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
would be better just so that we have
 
00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:10.039 align:start position:0%
something to work off of um as we start
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:17.240 align:start position:0%
audits s so I'm going to go the opposite
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
direction I'm going to ask that we don't
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
do number four um I think oplc is in
 
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:25.240 align:start position:0%
Lurch we've been changing the laws so
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
much regarding them and if I'm not
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
understanding Senator per will could
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
answer I think we have a 90 9 page Bill
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
sitting in uh Edna right now again
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
around oplc so I think that that's such
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
a moving Target that we should just
 
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
leave them alone for a while until the
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
dust settles and and we we have a little
 
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
standard there you're close I think it's
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
96 page so I tried to file that bill and
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
it was 114 Pages at the time and all
 
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
that said we can't draft it for you so
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
I'm glad they got it down to down little
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
six yeah um
 
00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:06.519 align:start position:0%
any thoughts about
 
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
other so if I can follow up on a
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
different so
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
again we've had we had this conversation
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
another agency about appeals and the
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
overall process of appeals within the
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
state how we deal with it whether it's a
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
Dees or any other agency and I'm
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
wondering whether there's there's a
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
bigger topic to be had there um I know
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns were grassed around
 
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
agencies having hearings officers within
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
their own agency making them dependent
 
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
upon the agency and necessarily not
 
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
likely to rule against the agency um or
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
at least it's probably not in their best
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
financial interest to do so and keep
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
their job possibly and so the I know
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
that we were having a discussion I'm
 
00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
trying to remember what committee it was
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
in but we're having a discussion about
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
the bigger overarching idea of how New
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire handles hearings and appeals
 
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
within agencies um and I don't know if
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
we want to just pick on this one agency
 
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
or whether we want to take a
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
bigger overarching you know big picture
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
view of how hearings and appeals happen
 
00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839 align:start position:0%
within the state within agencies and
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
identify what they look like
 
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.110 align:start position:0%
identify what they look like
representative

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you madam chair um I think
 
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
that's a really interesting topic I
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
don't think that first of all I my first
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
thought was making any audit bigger is
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
probably inviting it to be less thorough
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
because we have limited resources and my
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
second thought is that uh when you're
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
talking about that kind of inquiry about
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
the appeals process that sounds to me
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
very much like a study committee not not
 
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
an issue for an audit and I think if
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
we're looking for an audit then
 
00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
something that's narrowly focused is a
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
better choice and that's just my view of
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
the thing I agree with you I got it was
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
only going to be an inch deep and a mile
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
wide yeah I got
 
00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:12.639 align:start position:0%
that as I see in this letter we're to
 
00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:13.829 align:start position:0%
that as I see in this letter we're to
this

00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
proposal actually looks at four
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
different appeals
 
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
processes to begin with the agency is
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
here if we want to talk to who's here
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
chair

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
yes yes representative Weber thank you
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
very much um just as a preliminary
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
matter um I think as as people are
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
addressing their comments which I'm very
 
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
interested in um am I not correct that
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
what the audit does is look at and I
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
probably should have asked this before
 
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
we change the chairs over but what the
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
audit does is look at whether what's
 
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
happening on the ground comports with
 
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
our statutes rather than is it a good
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
thing generally so I just want to be
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
sure that we keep that all firmly in
 
00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:23.959 align:start position:0%
mind as we're going forward with the
 
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
with making determinations that's the
 
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
way I've always read performance a
 
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.150 align:start position:0%
way I've always read performance a
good

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
morning good morning uh for the record
 
00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:34.519 align:start position:0%
I'm Bob Scott commissioner with the
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services I
 
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
have my assistant commissioner uh Adam
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh kpo uh here with us also uh if I
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
could uh Madam chair uh maybe it would
 
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
be helpful to explain the current status
 
00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
legal status of where we are statutorily
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
with our uh our for councils so going
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
back in time to answer the senator uh
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
Lang's question uh well over a de decade
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
ago we transitioned to have not any
 
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
agency staff being the hearings officer
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
for these type of appeals uh we uh had
 
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
relied on uh the Attorney General's
 
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
office to appoint somebody to do that
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
for us uh in the last uh legislative
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
session in House Bill 2 uh we we sought
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
some further uh uh streamlining if you
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
will of the council process so what we
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
had uh asked for was multiple things uh
 
00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
we asked for the quorum to that's
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
necessary to get a council moving on
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
appeals to be reduced to three that is
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
today uh we also asked that these
 
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
councils be advisory to the hearing
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
officer appointed by the Attorney
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
General's office that did not get
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
through the legislation that start that
 
00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
the as introduced house bill to had that
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
and then that was that was taken out
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
instead of that in place of that was put
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
a uh legislative study committee
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
requirement was put in uh which we
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
strongly support uh also uh we did not
 
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
we were prior to House Bill 2 last year
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
we were Staffing uh the appeals process
 
00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:13.959 align:start position:0%
uh we kind of had a a a firewall but
 
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
with some staff uh supporting the
 
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:19.160 align:start position:0%
councils doing the getting the paperwork
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
for appeals and all that ready for them
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
I didn't like the Optics of that that
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
also was moved to the Attorney General's
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
office uh last session as well so
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
there's what what I'm here to say is I'm
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
not sure first of all there's there's no
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
over overlap with the Department in our
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
appeals process rightly so we're
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
separated so you know we issue our
 
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
decisions based on the record at the
 
00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:44.759 align:start position:0%
time if those are
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
appealed that's the only action we we've
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
issued that that appeal not the appeal
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
the the permitting action which is being
 
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
appealed and then it's entirely in the
 
00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:55.759 align:start position:0%
council's in the department of Justice's
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
hands so there's no overlay with I think
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
rightly so with the Department of
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services so I think
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
listening to Senator Lang that's that's
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
the direction I think you want to be for
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
the other other departments um so we do
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
have a representative from the
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice here also he's
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
willing to speak if need be but my I
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm here to tell you I
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
believe we've made changes to do exactly
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
I think the type of thing you want to do
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
we frankly uh we would like to see these
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
these councils move quicker also which
 
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
is why we were suggesting they become
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
advisory to the hearings officer so they
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
would be the subject matter experts the
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
hearing officer would be the final
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
decision maker uh that didn't make it
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
through I would I know that again House
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 had a had a legislative study
 
00:15:42.749 --> 00:15:42.759 align:start position:0%
committee requirement and I believe
 
00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:46.519 align:start position:0%
um held over Senate Bill 84 had the same
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
thing so we strongly support that I'm
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
not right quite sure what a audit would
 
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
do again as as rightly pointed out I
 
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
believe an audit is of are you following
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
the current laws and rules
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
but again that all just change so I'm
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
not quite sure what we'd be
 
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
accomplishing but uh we're here to
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you have
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
representer we do you know where we are
 
00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:11.959 align:start position:0%
in the study committee process at this
 
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
point is that that was House Bill too so
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
it should have been started already I'm
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
gon to uh let Adam answer that but I
 
00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:21.319 align:start position:0%
think nowhere is the answer hold on yeah
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
good morning um I we look when we looked
 
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
on the website for the hb2 study
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
committee it didn't look like they had
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
met uh or at least they didn't file a
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
report however I know in s sp84 which
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
was held over from the last session it
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
has the same study committee in it and I
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
know that P just recently passed the
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
house um in January and so that should
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
be headed to the Senate any time now and
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
we and like uh the commissioner said we
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh we are in strong support of a study
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you you answered all my
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
questions at least regarding your agency
 
00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:05.079 align:start position:0%
uh and how you handleing appeals I like
 
00:17:06.909 --> 00:17:06.919 align:start position:0%
the idea that's outside of your Agency
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
for the hearings offic so
 
00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:12.909 align:start position:0%
for the hearings offic so
thanks

00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
um I think that what the representatives
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
of the Judiciary Committee were
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about was that all four
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.789 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
think Madam chair is there a question
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
for me I can address that if you like
 
00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:42.039 align:start position:0%
yes pleas so so yes so right now the the
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
the four councils are set up by Statute
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
with subject matter experts depending on
 
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
the type of permit that we're doing so
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
there's an air counsil for uh air air
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
pollution control uh permits so they're
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
more uh aligned to to understand those
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
better similarly we have one for
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
Wetlands uh again Waste Management so
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
that that's by Design uh they have
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
synergized their rules over the years so
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
by and large their rules are are
 
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
essentially similar uh again that's out
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
of the Department's control we have a
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
separation so that's up to the councils
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
themselves not the department uh but we
 
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
certainly encourage that so so yes there
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
are four different councils that's again
 
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
I would argue would be fodder for maybe
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
a study committee uh a think we had
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
thrown out in the past is maybe a single
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
unified environmental Appeals Council
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
that perhaps could be advised by these
 
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts in that type of
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
thing so again I think there's a lot of
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of ways we can still improve the
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
process so and I guess um my latest
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
experience with the air
 
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
permit division is in my own District
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
there's a proposal for to build an
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
asphalt plant and Dees came down to
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
nashwa and held this very wasn't a
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
public hearing but it was public
 
00:19:05.679 --> 00:19:07.190 align:start position:0%
public hearing but it was public
information

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
session but the statute that they're
 
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.909 align:start position:0%
session but the statute that they're
supposed

00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
supposed
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
to base their opinion their opinion on
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
is a public health statute correct
 
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
and it was not clear to me that your
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
department interacts with HHS
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
on how that statute is supposed to be
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
interpreted M when you're evaluating an
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
air permit so it seems like maybe that's
 
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing a performance audit
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
could look
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
at potentially uh so
 
00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:53.799 align:start position:0%
125c uh it is a public health statute
 
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
but explicitly says the air Resources
 
00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
Division of the Department of
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services shall there
 
00:19:59.710 --> 00:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
there's a a lot of that language in
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
there so that's where the air pollution
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
control regulations are are housed uh
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
and that's where the expertise is in the
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
air Resources Division that division
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
also has an environmental Public Health
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
Group also and their job is to Lia with
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
the uh HHS uh public health and as
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
you're probably aware we're in the same
 
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
building so it's pretty easy to do that
 
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
so they do that fairly frequently so
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair I just don't
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
understand this because I haven't been
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
involved with Dees but are the councils
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
part of Dees or part of the AG's
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
office uh the councils are uh sep
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
they're administratively attached as far
 
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:45.559 align:start position:0%
as we do have the only involvement we
 
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
have right now is we'll have secretarial
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
support that can help them take minutes
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
of hearing so not hearings excuse me but
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
they one of their jobs is to advise our
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
divisions again these are subject miter
 
00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
experts from the communities uh some are
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
from industry some are from uh
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
environmental groups depending on how
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
the statute set up and one of their
 
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
roles is to advise us on our
 
00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.549 align:start position:0%
roles is to advise us on our
administrative

00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:09.559 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:11.799 align:start position:0%
rules uh and that's a process we go
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
through to get help get a little bit
 
00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:15.559 align:start position:0%
more uh context as we we go through a Ru
 
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
making process so the that's the largest
 
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
involvement we have so we'll have staff
 
00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
appear before them present rules and uh
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
we'll have somebody help them with notes
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
W with minutes but when it comes to an
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
appeal they are totally separate we have
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
no involvement with them
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
whatsoever follow Madam CH yes so where
 
00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
do they come from how the how the
 
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
councils come to be uh they're nominated
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
for the governor and councel process uh
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
in and and then reappointed uh as their
 
00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
terms come
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
up follow on that this might be a better
 
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
question for the Auditors I'll just ask
 
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
you so this seems to imply that a lot of
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
the issues with the councils you must
 
00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
have seen the letter from the correct
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
committee do I understand that
 
00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
correctly that that
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
the the the the concern of the committee
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
seems to be with regard to the councils
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
and their decision- making I believe so
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
but as I was pointing out though we'
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
we've tried to streamline the law to
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
help answer some of those questions no I
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
get that so my question so my question
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
is is is it your opinion that they
 
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
really don't fall under the offices of
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
the Department of enery Environmental
 
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
Services Environmental Services me and
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
thus wouldn't even come under the audit
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
the correct if Auditors were coming to
 
00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
ask us about it we'd say we've issued a
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
permit and okay thank
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
you yes and so again but I think to to
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
to your point Keith representative was
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
um the uh audit is about the council
 
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
right not about the agency at least
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's what representative uh Lynn is
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
asking and and the committee seems to be
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
is like the auditing the four councils
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
and their probably their ad proceedings
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
relative to appeals is what they're
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
looking to do at least as I read this
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
may I respond Madam chair yes and again
 
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
this probably needs to be opposed to the
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
Auditors but the question is do they
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
even come under our
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
legislator auditor ability to do that
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
AG come
 
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
on would you like me to stay up also
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair for the record
 
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
my name is Mark Delano I'm an Assistant
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
Attorney General from the Department of
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
Justice in the civil law
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
Bureau so reer would you like to ask
 
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.549 align:start position:0%
Bureau so reer would you like to ask
that

00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
question so my question is um we've had
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
discussions in the past over what the
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
boundaries are of the LPA the Auditors
 
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
basically the per performance Auditors
 
00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
do they do those boundaries include
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
auditing the councils which it seems
 
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
like maybe a significant part of what is
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
being asked of us here I would have to
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
take a look at the statute the govern's
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
audits I didn't do that in preparation
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
for today's meeting I can tell you
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
though that each of the environmental
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
councils are governed by their own
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
statute under
 
00:24:24.909 --> 00:24:24.919 align:start position:0%
210 uh for instance the wetlands council
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
is uh established under RSA 2
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
105 uh hyphen little a uh and and each
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
of the other other four have their own
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
Provisions in 210 so they fall under
 
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
from a um organizational standpoint
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
statutorily within the dees department
 
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
but each of those councils is only
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
administratively attached so the dees
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have um oversight over those
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
different councils they are independent
 
00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
ofs in that regard as your question
 
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
representative regarding uh whether or
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
not audit an audit could be performed to
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
those councils that's something that
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
we'd have to go back and look at the
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
statute on uh because and as I said I
 
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately didn't prepare for that
 
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:15.549 align:start position:0%
unfortunately didn't prepare for that
question

00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:15.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
today okay
 
00:25:17.679 --> 00:25:19.350 align:start position:0%
today okay
well

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
um that would be good to know okay
 
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
thanks yeah okay let's representative
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
Weber question I'm just trying to figure
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
out if I'm missing something here
 
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
they're statutorily created that's
 
00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.549 align:start position:0%
they're statutorily created that's
correct

00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
and I guess if you're doing the review
 
00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
my question would be could we divide it
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
into two parts one of which
 
00:25:47.789 --> 00:25:47.799 align:start position:0%
is I can't figure out why we wouldn't be
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
able to audit them but perhaps you'll
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
let let us know but the second part is
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
how would we word an audit to properly
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
include those things that we're trying
 
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
to get at and that would be
 
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.310 align:start position:0%
to get at and that would be
helpful

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner again I'm not an attorney
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
so uh take take it for what you will I
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
know in the past when we've had uh an
 
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
audit done with the Department uh at
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
least in one occasion they looked at the
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:24.110 align:start position:0%
 
also

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative uh the trouble is is
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
as an attorney I I can't guess on those
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
sorts of things so um and that and
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's why that's why uh you know my my
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh answer may have sounded a bit evasive
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
but that wasn't the intention the
 
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
intention was to communicate that I
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer right now but I
 
00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
will try to get it for
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
you Senator Pearl thank you commissioner
 
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to make sure I have my head
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
around these councils did I hear you
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
correctly that they only serve in an
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
advisory they they don't really have any
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
authority to make an adjudicated
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
decision they're just
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
an advisory is that correct no uh so
 
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to relay is uh our
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
initial request in the house house bill
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
in number H Bill 2 as introduced last
 
00:27:11.789 --> 00:27:11.799 align:start position:0%
year that was the language so so we
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
reduced the the quorum to three to make
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
it a little bit more uh easier to happen
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh and and and we also had language in
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
there that would make them advisory
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
again to the subject matter experts to
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
the hearing officer who would make the
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
decision that did not make it through
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
the legislative process uh but but again
 
00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:33.799 align:start position:0%
I that's one of the reasons why we're
 
00:27:33.799 --> 00:27:35.070 align:start position:0%
I that's one of the reasons why we're
encouraging

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
encouraging
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
encouraging I think there's more work to
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
be done there legislatively and that's
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
committee if there's an appeal then they
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
decide the appeal and issue a ruling
 
00:27:50.909 --> 00:27:50.919 align:start position:0%
correct so the hearing officer from the
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice will will rule on
 
00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:56.919 align:start position:0%
uh matters of law uh and they will the
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
council themselves rule on on the the
 
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
facts of the the case so thank you just
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
trying to get my head around make sure I
 
00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
had a correct but but do I understand
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
that what's being
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
suggested by the members of the
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee is not the initial
 
00:28:15.919 --> 00:28:17.430 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee is not the initial
decision

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.710 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
appeals because the these
 
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
councils issue an opinion opinion and
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
then the appeal is to the Superior Court
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court yes ma'am the Supreme
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
Court so I'm not exactly
 
00:28:39.919 --> 00:28:42.190 align:start position:0%
Court so I'm not exactly
sure

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
what part of the appeals
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
process is being recommended I thought
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
the appeal was to the councils correct
 
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
not the Supreme Court first correct if
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
if I may yeah exactly I think that's
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
what the senator was saying so the the
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
the initial appeal if if there's a
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
somebody's appealing one of our
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
permanent decisions would would go to
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
the council if they're grieved by that
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
then it would go to the Supreme Court
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
and I think there's been some discussion
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
in some of the bills that perhaps there
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
should be an intermediate step with the
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
superior court but again I would argue
 
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
that is fodder for legislative process
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
not whether you know I
 
00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:23.519 align:start position:0%
don't my opinion if I may ma'am uh Senor
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
chair auditing this at this point first
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
of all we have a brand new law that's
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
been place and I think a lot of the
 
00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
things raised in this these letters are
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
things that they would like to see
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
change in the law I don't know how an
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
audit does that but that's again
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
will Madam shair if I could just add to
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner Scott's statement uh so
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
over at
 
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
doj uh because of the passage of hp2
 
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
we've started taking over the functions
 
00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
of the appeals Clerk and we're working
 
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
on putting in place a permanent
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
full-time hearing officer uh because
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
some of the uh the funding that was at
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
Dees for dealing with that position has
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
been transferred to the Department of
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
Justice so so far we have a new appeals
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
clerk in place we have appointed uh
 
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
another Assistant Attorney General from
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
our Criminal Appeals division to work as
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
the uh uh interim hearing officer until
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
we identify a permanent hearing officer
 
00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:27.799 align:start position:0%
so there have been a lot of changes over
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
the last six months and uh you know to I
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
guess reiterate what commissioner Scott
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
said there isn't much to audit at this
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
point because we're still kind of
 
00:30:36.909 --> 00:30:36.919 align:start position:0%
putting these things in place one thing
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
I will will state though is that um the
 
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:42.519 align:start position:0%
councils to the extent that we were able
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
to do this have adopted procedural rules
 
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
for appeals which are more or less
 
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
uniform okay there are some numbering
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
differences there are some uh
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
idiosyncrasies among the councils but
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
for the most part uh this process
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
started two years ago
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh first it was uh Wetlands they were
 
00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.039 align:start position:0%
the first to have the new rules then air
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh and then last fall uh waste and then
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
this past month uh water so they've you
 
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
know gone through they've been
 
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
extensively changed we've held public
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
hearings we've been to Jael car a few
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
times and uh you know so now those are
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
in place so I I I think that if if the
 
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
consideration now is an audit it kind of
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
seems as if well anything that would be
 
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
audited might be something under the old
 
00:31:31.149 --> 00:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
system but because we have this new
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
system it just kind of doesn't seem
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
point representative R thank you madam
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
chair I'm convinced that we're not ready
 
00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
to move forward on this audit and I'm
 
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
ready to put forth another topic when we
 
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:50.919 align:start position:0%
finished with this one is there any
 
00:31:50.919 --> 00:31:53.629 align:start position:0%
finished with this one is there any
further

00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
discussion I
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
agre yeah I I I don't feel like we're
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
ready to go on this one um we do have
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
some other potential ones do you want to
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
raise yours I do
 
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
first I'm looking at number six and
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
again I don't want to really dig into
 
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.950 align:start position:0%
again I don't want to really dig into
the

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
contractors but when we do the dees
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
budget so much of each department goes
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
out to Contracting roughly 20% and since
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
this department is almost half of the
 
00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
budget this this represents a sizable
 
00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
amount that we know so little about in
 
00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
the uh Health and Human Services
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
Department so just kind of a list of how
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
many contractors what the total cost is
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
and and perhaps how the process works so
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
that is there really is it competitive
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
or are they just looking for the same
 
00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
contract the year after year uh is it
 
00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
just kind of single bit bids and it just
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
goes through year after year to the same
 
00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:08.519 align:start position:0%
contractors and do the same contractors
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
have several different contracts with
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
with the HHS I don't think this is
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
something where you really need to dig
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
very deep into who the contractors are
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
and what are they doing but has the same
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
contract that got five or six different
 
00:33:26.669 --> 00:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
contracts and you know there was uh and
 
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
the receivables I'm interested in
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
knowing who's looking at the receivables
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
and you know how how complete are they I
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
mean some years ago going back quite a
 
00:33:39.549 --> 00:33:39.559 align:start position:0%
while we had a contract that was
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to reduce teenage smoking and
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
we spent a couple million dollars year
 
00:33:46.509 --> 00:33:46.519 align:start position:0%
after year to reduce teenage smoking
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
finally somebody looked at it and said
 
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
teenage smoking is increasing what are
 
00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
we why are we paying these people a
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year or two million
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
whatever it was to reduce teenage
 
00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.430 align:start position:0%
whatever it was to reduce teenage
smoking

00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
smoking
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
nothing seems to happen so we canceled
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
that contract in the budget that that
 
00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
contractor probably spent all that money
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
putting out ads saying the state is not
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
doing enough to stop teenage smoking it
 
00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
was it was on all the radios and I don't
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
know if it made TV but all the money
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
that they hadn't spent doing what they
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
said they were going to do they seem to
 
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
spend an advertising telling how evil
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
the state was for not following up but
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
anyway so ever since then I've been
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
wondering why don't we know more about
 
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
where the the contracts are going are
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
they going to several different people
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
are is there a real bidding process or
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
are the same people getting them year
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
after year and the same people may be
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
getting multiple contracts so I don't
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
need to dig into really the what's going
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
on but just kind of the process and I'm
 
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
hoping that we get more better
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
information on thank you
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
Weber isn't that something that could be
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
requested of LBA by um I mean it's
 
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
information it's not an audit and isn't
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
that something that could be requested
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
now either of the LBA either by um one
 
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
of the uh Finance committees or by
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal requested by
 
00:35:20.109 --> 00:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal there's no need for an audit I
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
would Envision it being a little wider
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
then because you know that if the
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
process is is more complicated than just
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
saying okay you have the contract who
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
bid for it who where were the biders did
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
you choose the the lowest bidder um the
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
same person do it last year what were
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
the receivables were they satisfactory
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
have we really seen any progress from
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
this contractor that sort of thing uh I
 
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
don't think that's it's just a little
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
wider in my mind than what LBA would do
 
00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.150 align:start position:0%
wider in my mind than what LBA would do
thank

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
you I mean I guess we could
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
certainly seek to understand why it
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
takes so
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
long to get a
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
contract to the executive Council I mean
 
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
because it takes five six
 
00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.109 align:start position:0%
because it takes five six
months

00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:36:12.119 --> 00:36:14.990 align:start position:0%
months
um

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
I I know they've
 
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.309 align:start position:0%
I I know they've
had

00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
vacancies in the Contracting
 
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.390 align:start position:0%
vacancies in the Contracting
unit

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
um but what's the will of
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
the committee do you want to discuss
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
some of these other ideas for yes Senate
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
so out of out of the eight on the list I
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
had two I wanted to take a look at one
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
was the doorways program the other one
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
was the interplay of DCF and the bureau
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
and number eight so number two and eight
 
00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
for my concerns eight as you know
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
Senator you and I had to deal with an
 
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
issue this January through March with a
 
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
with a child that was stuck in the
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
emergency room for almost 60 plus stay
 
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
not receiving Services um that had a
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
problem so I'm interested in was there a
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
bottleneck I I I will say you all be DH
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
GCF the Department of Health and Human
 
00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
help me dramat they were responsive they
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
just didn't have an answer to this
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
problem um and the kid wasn't involved
 
00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
DC right and so the question is whether
 
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
there's any benefit that would have been
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
that particular one family's instance
 
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
with 60 days is there was it an
 
00:37:27.069 --> 00:37:27.079 align:start position:0%
interplay issue between the agencies
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
trying to find uh between Behavioral
 
00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
Services and DHHS to try to find
 
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%
placement or was it um just we don't
 
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
have services and then on the other on
 
00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
the doorway I'm sorry we bring number
 
00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.510 align:start position:0%
the doorway I'm sorry we bring number
eight

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
forward well wait we have questions so
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
on the doorway program again we're
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
seeing a significant amount of money
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
flow into the opioid and we're having
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
discussions now about marijuana and
 
00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
potentially greasing uh more drug uh uh
 
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
related things going on within the state
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
and so the question is should we take a
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
look at our existing substance abuse
 
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
programs and see if they're they're
 
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
functional if they're working for our
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
citizens are they getting the services
 
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
and uh representative wier's point the
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
receivables are we seeing uh less
 
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
recidivism relative the people who have
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
gone into treatment um and with given
 
00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
all the money we're spending so those
 
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
are the two I want to see talk about
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
move forward Senator Whitley thank you
 
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I I agree particular with
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
number eight um my concern is as we are
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
know continue to build our children's
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
mental health system that our systems
 
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
are talking to each other there's a lot
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
of overlap between dcyf and the Bureau
 
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
for children's Behavioral Health and I
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that that um
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
those systems are consistent for example
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
many children are placed out of state
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
not by DCF but by the Bureau of uh
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health and I think
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
there are differing levels of due
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
process when that happens and
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
notification and so um I know that we
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
are working towards decreasing the
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
amount of children who are placed out of
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
state I think that is critical and
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
should be a top priority I think we need
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
to look at it though you you saw the
 
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
situation in Tennessee and so the scope
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
would be I think starting to look at how
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
those out of state placements are made
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
and then secondary how those uh outof
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
home decisions are made um particularly
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
when it's involving the children's
 
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Bureau I think we have
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
sort of more information about how DCF
 
00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.109 align:start position:0%
sort of more information about how DCF
does

00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
that something that is very much related
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
to that system integration piece is
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
who's paying for it um we know
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
that there is a very large budget folks
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
who are on finance know that the budget
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
for children's Behavioral Health is
 
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
really large and that's in part because
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
of residential placements it's also in
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
part because there are children that are
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
getting pushed into the Medicaid system
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps because they're not getting
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
coverage for services by their private
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and so we do know
 
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
that there is a level of um sort of
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know is it appropriate for the
 
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
state system to be providing so much
 
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
services for children that should be
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
getting coverage in the private
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
insurance so I very interested in that
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
Weber I I would just second all of that
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
um I really think that understanding
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
where where where the limits are where
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
the interstices are how how how the two
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
agencies mesh and how those decisions
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
are made I think they're I think there
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
are larger policy questions involved as
 
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
well but understanding how the process
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
works at the moment um and and how they
 
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
are dealt with I think would be really
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
helpful so I would um at any appropriate
 
00:40:59.230 --> 00:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
time I would be glad to either move or
 
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
second a motion that we bring number
 
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:01.829 align:start position:0%
second a motion that we bring number
eight

00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
forward uh as uh that of the two of them
 
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
that would be my first priority
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
certainly going
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
forward I'm also I'm interested in that
 
00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:16.839 align:start position:0%
one but also the door ways
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
because um we spend
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
Millions on this program and we have no
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
idea really what we get for that I mean
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
they're open 8 to five Monday through
 
00:41:35.309 --> 00:41:35.319 align:start position:0%
Friday I think how many clients are they
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
serving what is
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
the time between client showing up and
 
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
treatment or interaction with a
 
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
provider being maintained how many of
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
the interactions are with the phone line
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
versus the physical
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
place but
 
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
um I think those two are really
 
00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.670 align:start position:0%
um I think those two are really
important

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
but if we want to entertain a motion i'
 
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
recognize someone Senator Langan mam
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
chair I'd move we move number eight in
 
00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
position one and as a backup number two
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
second second if I second with me on
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
motion by Senator Lane further questions
 
00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.630 align:start position:0%
motion by Senator Lane further questions
discussion

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
Center web I just want to make sure you
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
all have enough guidance on that lad qu
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
on number eight because it is a big one
 
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
do you need any sort of
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
um sort of what we think the largest
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
there hello my name is Jay Henry I'm the
 
00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh performance audit supervisor for the
 
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
LBA audit division um I think what we'll
 
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
need is just time to get in to that
 
00:42:58.349 --> 00:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
topic I mean it sounds like there's two
 
00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:00.559 align:start position:0%
there's a bureau in the division within
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
the department of of Health and Human
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
Services um we have to look at the the
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
the laws how that connects also just how
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
many children are are seen by both um
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
agencies so I think we probably need to
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
do more background we're going to come
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
back with we'd come back with a scope
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
statement and that's probably where we
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
can really fine-tune what you're
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
interested in what what's there um at
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
least that's my my sort of gut
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
reaction not the the the second point of
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
that question though while you're
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with the interplay the also the
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
question is the funding right so the
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
last the last question and setting in
 
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
line eight right oh the private
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
insurance General concern uh about
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
private insurance is not covering the
 
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
necessary need right that that's sort of
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
another issue that secondary issue that
 
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
the Senor with yeah I I see it as
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
actually not secondary I see it as a
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
part a symptom of the problem um you
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
know for example there is a door into
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh eligibility door into
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
Medicaid we used to call Katie Becket it
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
and it and children enter that door
 
00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
based on the severity of their you know
 
00:44:16.829 --> 00:44:16.839 align:start position:0%
their symptoms and their disorder and so
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
there is a general sense that children
 
00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
are getting pushed into Medicaid through
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
Katie Becket because they are not
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
getting what they need early on um and
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
that's the issue that I'm very very
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
concerned in the department of insurance
 
00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
is doing a lot of work about thinking
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
through what is covered what is not
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
covered what should be covered so I'm
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
less concerned with that I'm more
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
concerned about you know that Acuity
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
that is leading kids to get into that
 
00:44:41.069 --> 00:44:41.079 align:start position:0%
system and how much you're paying for
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
that instead of the private insurance
 
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:56.559 align:start position:0%
sense okay so we have a motion to put
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
first number eight then number two into
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
the queue any further discussion or all
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
in favor say I I any
 
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.270 align:start position:0%
in favor say I I any
opposed

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
okay so um probably the next time we
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
meet you might have a proposed scope
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
can I make a comment of course Madam
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
chair um are there any topics on this
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
list that we want to remove or is the
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
committee interested in keeping all of
 
00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
Senator so again three and four we had a
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
pretty extensive discussion around three
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a moving Target right
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
now and probably been delayed for a
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
couple years and then we can come back
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
and look at it and see whether or not
 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
that appeal process needs to be dealt
 
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
with and number four as I said again
 
00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:15.079 align:start position:0%
moving Target I think that could be
 
00:46:16.589 --> 00:46:16.599 align:start position:0%
taken off the list for a couple years
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
and be brought back if someone sees a
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
problem but we're making some dramatic
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
changes in both those areas I think we
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
could take them off the list for now
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
it'd be my
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
opinion Senator Perl
 
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:30.839 align:start position:0%
I'd also add number one to that was
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
public access to bodies of water I'm not
 
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
aware of any real concerns there in that
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
area I don't know how long that's been
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
on this yeah
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
list it came from the the prior
 
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
committee it was just a topic that
 
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
brought up and but without a complaint
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
we didn't know exactly what was wrong it
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
was just sort of more of an issue that
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
we've never looked at
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay so we're talking about taking off
 
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.390 align:start position:0%
okay so we're talking about taking off
one

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
three and four for now five is still in
 
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
litigation so I think probably we'd be
 
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
interested in this when that dust
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
settles um contract management we should
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
keep on
 
00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:24.230 align:start position:0%
keep on

sen mam chair I move I make a motion we
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%

00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
pick it off the table and dispose of it
