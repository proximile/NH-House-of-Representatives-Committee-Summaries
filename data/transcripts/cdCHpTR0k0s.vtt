as this past the house with the house
 
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
version we all unanimously concur and
 
00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
we're very supportive our are

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
with the the senate version there are
 
00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
some questions and many mainly it's we'd
 
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
like to have some information from des
 
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
if we may be so we start right out could
 
00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
you please explain to us the
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation of seven point plus
 
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars where that comes from
 
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
how that works
 
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
um we understand
 
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
that as when we pass this bill there is
 
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
roughly around 120 000 dollars set aside
 
00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 align:start position:0%
for us staff over at the department to
 
00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:15.990 align:start position:0%
for us staff over at the department to
monitor

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
monitor
 
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 align:start position:0%
uh the and put into the database the
 
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
information that comes back from the
 
00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
school districts guarding leading their
 
00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
water in the after several rounds et
 
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
cetera and we understand where that
 
00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 align:start position:0%
dollar comes from to do the analysis of
 
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
the water
 
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
in is that a separate grant from the
 
00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
infrastructure grant that we're talking
 
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
about here we're just
 
00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
yep okay hi my name is leanne atwell and
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
i work at des and i am the program
 
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
manager for the lead in school and child
 
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
care facility drinking water program uh
 
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
7.6 7.76 million dollars is
 
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
unrelated to the lead in school and
 
00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
drinking water program it is related to
 
00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.350 align:start position:0%
drinking water program it is related to
a

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.390 align:start position:0%
a
matching

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
matching
 
00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
fund that is needed for state revolving
 
00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 align:start position:0%
loan fund
 
00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:11.910 align:start position:0%
loan fund
funding

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 align:start position:0%
that would come as part of the
 
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
bipartisan infrastructure law
 
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement that the state
 
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 align:start position:0%
provide matching funds so that we can
 
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
get approximately 20 million dollars
 
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
from the federal government for state
 
00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
revolt for the state revolving loan fund
 
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
and the drinking water that'll fund
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
drinking water
 
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure improvements across the
 
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.830 align:start position:0%
infrastructure improvements across the
state

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
so i have a question for you the when we
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
got a letter from robert scott
 
00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:38.950 align:start position:0%
got a letter from robert scott
um

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
there was mention to the u.s epa water
 
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.270 align:start position:0%
there was mention to the u.s epa water
infrastructure

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
improvement for the nation grant
 
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
w i i n i guess
 
00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 align:start position:0%
is that the money is that where the
 
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
money is coming from for the analysis of
 
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
the water that's correct so today we've
 
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.629 align:start position:0%
the water that's correct so today we've
seen

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
des has received approximately two
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars through that grant
 
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
program and that'll be used for testing
 
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
it is also being used for outreach and
 
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.189 align:start position:0%
it is also being used for outreach and
education

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
and it's being used to
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
to fund
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
my position which is a part-time
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
temporary position to manage the program
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
are there questions of the department
 
00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
from any
 
00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:23.749 align:start position:0%
from any
folks

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
are our answers
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead represent cordelia
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for being here
 
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
so um if i understand correctly this is
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
matching dollars and this
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh money would be coming from a warrant
 
00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
authorized by the governor from the
 
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
and appropriated in the next biennium
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
no how does that work senator it's the
 
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal year that begins this july first
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
okay but it is general funds general
 
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
are there
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
further questions that was the reason
 
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
why the house called the committee a
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
conference to
 
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
try to figure out how the seven million
 
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
dollars interacted here
 
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.670 align:start position:0%
dollars interacted here
um

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on this
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative ellison
 
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so i as
 
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
i understand it the 7.7
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
million if it came from the general fund
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
would be a match against 7.7 million of
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
federal money am i interpreting that
 
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
correctly i think the the
 
00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
sum coming from the federal would be 21
 
00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:45.270 align:start position:0%
sum coming from the federal would be 21
million

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a you know it's not a
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
one-to-one match but it's a contribution
 
00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:50.550 align:start position:0%
one-to-one match but it's a contribution
that

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:09.670 align:start position:0%
 
1421.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay so the
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
obviously the senate version is the
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
version which contains the the
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
funds for the revolving fund the the
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
is there any opposition from committee
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
members on the house side here to
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
seating to the senate
 
00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:39.350 align:start position:0%
seating to the senate
position

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
if if i may i'm not sure
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
des had also sent an email about the
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
floor amendment that was added on on the
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
senate floor i'm not sure
 
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
if if you had received that i have
 
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
copies of that that i can hand out if
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
that's helpful
 
00:07:56.479 --> 00:08:23.830 align:start position:0%
that's helpful
sure

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
the version of the bill that you have in
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
front of you uh the the text that is
 
00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:31.990 align:start position:0%
front of you uh the the text that is
shown

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
shown
 
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.269 align:start position:0%
shown
in

00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
red is the text that was the amendments
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
that were made
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
on the on the floor amendment when the
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
senate was when the senate took up hb
 
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.110 align:start position:0%
senate was when the senate took up hb
1421

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
1421
 
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.389 align:start position:0%
1421
and

00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
des would recommend going back to the
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
version that passed out of the education
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
and finance committees and that text is
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
shown in blue
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
just so you can see the differences
 
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.110 align:start position:0%
just so you can see the differences
um

00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
we have concerns that that the the floor
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
amendment would essentially
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
make the
 
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.470 align:start position:0%
make the
the

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
option to
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
install bottle filling stations
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
difficult to implement
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
the first part of the amendment had
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
changed the requirement to install
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
bottle filling stations within 180 days
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
of bill passage and
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
just a couple of things regarding that
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
that time frame you know most schools
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
have already set their budgets for the
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
coming year and so if they've not
 
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
already planned and budgeted for that
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have the funds set aside
 
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.670 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have the funds set aside
to

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
to put in bottle filling stations
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
and then also you know we've been
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
noticing on our other projects some
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
supply chain
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
and issues and contractor availability
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh just in terms of you know all of the
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
the projects going on right now so
 
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:52.519 align:start position:0%
we do have some concerns about that
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
180-day time frame just being
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
you know the practicality of actually
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
being able to to install bottle filling
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
and then the next part of the amendment
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
on the next page
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph c
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
originally the way the the bill was
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
written as it passed out of the
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
education and finance committee
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
committees in the senate was that if
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
bottle filling stations were installed
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
then other outlets such as classroom
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
sinks and bathroom sinks that weren't
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
used for consumption could be posted as
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
not being suitable for
 
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.230 align:start position:0%
not being suitable for
consumption

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
consumption
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
and the amendment essentially requires
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
that if you put in bottle filling
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
stations that you would still test all
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
of the bathroom and cloth bathroom sinks
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
and classroom sinks in a facility and so
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
essentially makes the bottle filling
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
station option um you know not very
 
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.430 align:start position:0%
station option um you know not very
practical

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
practical
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know the intention of the bottle
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
filling station option was to be able to
 
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.990 align:start position:0%
filling station option was to be able to
provide

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
more flexibility to schools so they
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
could install those stations instead of
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
testing 30 50 sinks within a building um
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
and really directs students to those
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
bottle filling stations as to be you
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
know those are the locations where they
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
should get their water rather than
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
classroom and bathroom sinks
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
represent cordelia and then represent uh
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
senator dependency
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you just going back to the 7.7
 
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.470 align:start position:0%
thank you just going back to the 7.7
million

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.990 align:start position:0%
million
briefly

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
is there a deadline
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
for the state to provide the
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
matching funds in order to get the full
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that i'm
 
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.829 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that i'm
sorry

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
i would imagine there is i know you know
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
we're working on um work plans right now
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
for that funding so i imagine there is a
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
deadline but i'm sorry i don't know off
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
the top of my head second or do you want
 
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
to go senator hennessey
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
thank you uh just to send uh
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli's question
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
i i don't know what the deadline is but
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
i imagine there was and that's why we
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
had to add it in the senate when we
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
found out about them um a question for
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
leanne um
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
so the reason why we added the 180 days
 
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
on the senate side is because if you
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
follow through the logic of options here
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
and you've identified that you have a
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
lead issue in a school
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
if you don't put a timeline on the ins
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
on this installation of the water
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
filling stations
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
i and you're choosing the water bottle
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
filling station as your option to
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
remediate i don't see where
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
there's any time frame for remediation
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
do you understand where we're going out
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
on that yeah yep
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
yep i under i under i can see i can see
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
the you know where that was coming from
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
i just i think the 180 days might be a
 
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.710 align:start position:0%
i just i think the 180 days might be a
little

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
little
 
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.389 align:start position:0%
little
um

00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
might be a little too too soon just
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
given the budget the budget constraints
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
for schools
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you just following up on senator
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
hennessey's point
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
the water bottle filling stations are
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
not required
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
they're an option
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
for schools so
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
a school that does not
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
have the budget is not required
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
to have a water bottle filling station
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
would you agree
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
right it's not a requirement but it's
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
just an option that they can choose to
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
do that instead of testing and keeping
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
track of you know multiple
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
multiple outlets
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
and if i could follow up yes
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
on the your your second
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
um blue section
 
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.069 align:start position:0%
um blue section
um

00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
the senate was concerned
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
that even if
 
00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:50.470 align:start position:0%
that even if
a

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
school did
 
00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
decide to
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
have the water bottle filling station
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
there would still be water
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
that children could have access to
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the school
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
and since the whole point of this bill
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
keep children safe from lead in their
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
drinking water
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
the senate thought it was important to
 
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.430 align:start position:0%
the senate thought it was important to
say

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
you still have to test the other
 
00:14:20.079 --> 00:14:21.350 align:start position:0%
you still have to test the other
outlets

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
outlets
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
for the presence of lead if children
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
have access
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to you and i think
 
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.030 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to you and i think
the

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know the um
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
the concept is that if you put the
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
bottle filling stations in then at those
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
other sinks they would be clearly marked
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
as not suitable for drinking water and
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
students would not be allowed to to use
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
those so if you had a sink in a
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
classroom that hadn't been tested that
 
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
you know that would be part of the
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
process is that students shouldn't be
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
filling their water bottles up there
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
they should be directed to fill them up
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
at the at the water bottle filling
 
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.350 align:start position:0%
at the at the water bottle filling
stations

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
even if they can't read
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right well they make you
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
know there are signs that you know that
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
are that are graphics that
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative cornelli
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
i believe where we are is that we have
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
been presented with the senate amendment
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
that includes
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
um all their amendments
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
so if we were to want to consider the
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
language just prevent presented to us
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
um prior to some of the senate
 
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.790 align:start position:0%
um prior to some of the senate
amendments

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
on the language in blue on this document
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
um am i correct that that would have to
 
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.350 align:start position:0%
um am i correct that that would have to
be

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this uh committee yes at
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
that we'd have to have an amendment just
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
for new construction are the schools
 
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
mandated to have bottle uh facilities in
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
a new building i understood in the
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
legislation we've previously seen that
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
they would be required to have these
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
facilities in a new construction
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
i believe there was a bill and i'm not
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
sure of the status maybe it was
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
sb 599 that was taken up the session
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
that would require bottle filling
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
stations and new construction but i've
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
not been following that i'm not sure
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
what happened to remember it
 
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
yes senator sherman's bill i don't know
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
the number
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
we passed that
 
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.389 align:start position:0%
we passed that
so

00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:43.430 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh chairman lad it's still i i
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
understand the concern for the um
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
for the budget-wise and for the um
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
the the material shortages that were
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
have going on right now
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
but i have a concern
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
not so much for the second change
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
proposal on the second page but the
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
first page
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
if we don't put a time constraint in
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
when they choose that option
 
00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:12.069 align:start position:0%
when they choose that option
because

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
they either take option a or they take
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
option b
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
and so if they take option a and they
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
just never do anything about it because
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
they're not required to install them by
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of time then they're
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
not testing and they're not remediating
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
and we we don't know if there's lead
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
that the kids are being exposed to
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
and we don't know
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
if they have clean drinking water so if
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have a time frame in there then
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
they actually haven't chosen to do
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
anything if they've not installed a
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
water bottle filling station does that
 
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
make sense yes
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
so is the 180 days that's
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
here um
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
are you advocating to change that or
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm advocating to keep the time
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
frame in because if the school doesn't
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
have the budget or can't
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
when they are choosing to go that route
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind that schools are already
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
supposed to been testing
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
this is not something new that they are
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
so if they haven't actually tested yet
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
this would leave them option of
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
doing something
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
when they can raise the funds to put in
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
but they would wouldn't have actually
 
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.350 align:start position:0%
but they would wouldn't have actually
tested

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
tested
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
their water sources to know that they
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
have lead or don't have lead so i'm i'm
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
in favor of keeping the 180 days and if
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
a school cannot choose that route for
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
the water bottle filling station they
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
have the alternative route
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
of testing
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
and remediating
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
which could be just capping
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
or bringing
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
well i concur with what you're saying
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
so are are you saying that you're good
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
i am definitely good with 180 days i'm
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
open to discussion on the second page
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:19.590 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
completely agree with you
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
that we need to have
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
time parameters
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
on installing the water bottle filling
 
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.029 align:start position:0%
on installing the water bottle filling
stations

00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
stations
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
if that's the route
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
the school is chosen to take in fact
 
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.190 align:start position:0%
the school is chosen to take in fact
that

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
180 days it's consistent with
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
on the top of page two
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
which says if you've already installed
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
the water bottle filling stations you
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
have to test them within 180 days but
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey is absolutely right
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise a school could say we're going
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
to go water bottle filling station but
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
we're never we're just not going to get
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
around to it because
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
there's no timing required
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
on when we
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
act and and that doesn't seem to make
 
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.789 align:start position:0%
act and and that doesn't seem to make
sense

00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
i think that the language
 
00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:17.190 align:start position:0%
i think that the language
um

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
in blue is more protective of children
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
the testing for water is not expensive
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
23 000 tests
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
have already been conducted
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
in schools
 
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.510 align:start position:0%
in schools
um

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
over the last few years it's 90 plus
 
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.470 align:start position:0%
over the last few years it's 90 plus
percent

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
of schools have already tested
 
00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:47.669 align:start position:0%
of schools have already tested
once

00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
once
 
00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:49.430 align:start position:0%
once
um

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
well i don't think it's
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
as critical i think it's
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
i think it's more protective of children
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
than just labeling an outlet not for
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
fall down
 
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.310 align:start position:0%
fall down
disappear

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
disappear
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
i would think that a community would
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
want to know if their kids are being
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
poisoned by lead in the drinking water
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
isn't the present time frame correct me
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong i thought it was june 30th
 
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.390 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong i thought it was june 30th
2024

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
that you had funds to pay for the
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
analysis of these checks which you're
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
and that is enough money there to
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
support two rounds of checking i
 
00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.590 align:start position:0%
support two rounds of checking i
understand

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
is that being done now by schools
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
that's correct we have the funding for
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
it it's available to public schools and
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
licensed child care facilities
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
yes so we've not started the round of
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
testing the next round of testing yet
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
we're waiting to see what happens with
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation before we you know roll
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
out testing and um you know want to make
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
sure that there's clear direction on
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
what you know what happens on the back
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
end um so but we do anticipate that that
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
would start later and is the database up
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
and running so that you can get the
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
rechecks put into the database
 
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.710 align:start position:0%
rechecks put into the database
yes

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
and okay that's a good question didn't
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
we appropriate 1.6 million dollars
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
in fact only about 70 something thousand
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
yes so the 1.6 million dollars came from
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
the drinking water and groundwater trust
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
fund and was a grant to department of
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of education to
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
um to help schools with remediation
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
projects and that's a 50
 
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.310 align:start position:0%
projects and that's a 50
reimbursement

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
process so the schools pay for the pay
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
for the work and then they can apply for
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
the grants and get reimbursed 50 percent
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
and you're right not very much money of
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
that has been spent and we think a lot
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
of it is the timing you know the program
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
was really getting going right before
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
the pandemic started and schools have
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
been focused on other things and we've
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
since hired an outreach contractor
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
that's actually going through and
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
reaching out to schools that are
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
eligible and encouraging them to apply
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
so we hope that
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
you know hope to make that process
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
easier for schools
 
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.390 align:start position:0%
easier for schools
but

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
almost all of the money
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
is still available to schools
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
correct i think so far about 78 000
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know the exact number but in
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
so looking at this amendment and i'm
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
reading the top part says the language
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
modified by amendment 1839 s on the
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
senate floor needs to be restored and
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
provisions 1839
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
need to be removed the language that
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
needs to be removed is shown in red the
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
language that needs to be restored is
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
shown in blue so if we follow that
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
the way it's put out does what has to be
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
changed if anything has to be changed to
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
accomplish what you're trying to
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
accomplish senator hennessey
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
or rosenwald
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
the time frame
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't understand
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
i think for me
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
i would not agree with
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
the proposed change that's on page one
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
i would just leave it as amended by the
 
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.870 align:start position:0%
i would just leave it as amended by the
senate

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
and then i would like to confer with my
 
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
senate colleagues on the proposed change
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
so would you like to just take a short
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
caucus and do that
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
sure i think we have a little bit of
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
time here
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
over across the street now cheers
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
tonight to be meeting right you have a 9
 
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.269 align:start position:0%
tonight to be meeting right you have a 9
30.

00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
30.
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
can you take about five minutes uh
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
senator and trying to square that up or
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:07.909 align:start position:0%
 
a

00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so the senate would
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
like to maintain its position with the
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
red language on page number one yes
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
and then on page number two
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
understanding that there may be some
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
confusion around
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
what outlet a kid might have access to
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
we're not intending
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
to test
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
janitor closet
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
water faucets here we're intending to
 
00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.830 align:start position:0%
water faucets here we're intending to
test

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
if there's a faucet in the in the in the
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
um classroom where a kid could fit
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
easily the child has access yep so um
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe you guys can give me comments
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
on this so so change the red language
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
um remove the word such as to to
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
including so water from other outlets
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
available to children including
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
classroom and bathroom sinks and water
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
outlet dudes for preparing food
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
preparation shall be tested and
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
remediated if necessary per the
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
provisions in paragraph 3. so removing
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
such as
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
input including
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
so because recognizing that such as
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.399 --> 00:29:51.590 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.549 align:start position:0%
question
yes

00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
question um in the proposed blue
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
language um in c um you would not add
 
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
the last sentence about uh food
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
preparation water
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
you're just looking at
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
um the let's say the side by side c
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
and just making the one change of um
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
what's happening that last sentence in
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
the blue on that second page
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
water used for food preparation shall be
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
done exclusively through the use of
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
water bottling filling stations if such
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
outlet has not been tested and
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
you want to have that outlet
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
in the kitchen
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
so maybe that's you're objecting to that
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
no i'm just uh
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
questioning i'm uh i was a little
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
confused by the language in the in that
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
so the red language does have water
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
outlets used for food preparation shall
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
be tested and remediated if necessary
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
so the remediation could include
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
capping it and putting in water bottle
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
filling station or could
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
it could be fixing the pipe or putting a
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
so in summary then you're offer
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
on the first page there
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
keeping the original language of the
 
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.350 align:start position:0%
keeping the original language of the
senate

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
and then on page two
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh changing the words such as to
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
including classroom bathroom sinks
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.950 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.470 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
we i how how is the you know the house
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh in regard to the proposed change
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
right here from the senate
 
00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.070 align:start position:0%
right here from the senate
good

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
we're acceptable to that
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
so i guess what we where we are right
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
now is that
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
are we going to approve based upon the
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
language we're approving here right now
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
and get an amendment made
 
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
or having the amendment made and then
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
that would be up to you mr chairman
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
because in the senate we do committee
 
00:32:16.159 --> 00:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
because in the senate we do committee
amendments

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:16.870 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.950 align:start position:0%
amendments
[Laughter]

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
um since we're only adding one word
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:35.590 align:start position:0%
 
maybe

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
maybe i could ask grant what what we
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
yeah because we were so close you know
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
some of us have a multitude of
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
conferences still ahead of us are behind
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
us even
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
grant bossie new hampshire senate uh
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
it's a house bill generally the house
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
would write the report you just write
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
the report however you want to write it
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
and that's the version that gets signed
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
off on
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
okay so you don't need to formally adopt
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
the introduction
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
we don't need another meeting i think
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
that we can all agree upon what we've
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
done right here
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
um senator
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
you're good with that absolutely okay so
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
it looks like we're all concurrent so
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
you're agreeing and we're agreeing to
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
the senate version as amended with our
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%

yes
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
i think we are done
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%

i'm sure you've all read that and
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
familiar with the positions
 
01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.990 align:start position:0%
familiar with the positions
um

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
is there do we have any kind of an
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
amendment yet amendment yet uh
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
on anything here no okay
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
let's work our way down through it um
 
01:02:34.319 --> 01:02:35.349 align:start position:0%
let's work our way down through it um
the

01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
i guess the concern the largest concern
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
would be whether it's opt out or opt
 
01:02:40.559 --> 01:02:42.390 align:start position:0%
would be whether it's opt out or opt
in

01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
that would be probably you know the
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
primary and the house version is to opt
 
01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.589 align:start position:0%
primary and the house version is to opt
in

01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
senate version is to keep it the way it
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
is now
 
01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
discussion representative cordelli
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
i think the other
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
important thing in the uh house version
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
is that it requires a local school
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
district um
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
board uh approval of the survey before
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's given
 
01:03:13.839 --> 01:03:14.870 align:start position:0%
it's it's given
um

01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
and just in in general about the survey
 
01:03:18.559 --> 01:03:20.630 align:start position:0%
and just in in general about the survey
um

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
this is supposed to be a survey related
 
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
to health related behaviors um according
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
to the cdc
 
01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:28.470 align:start position:0%
to the cdc
um

01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
has said this is a survey about
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
and when you start the survey
 
01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:41.349 align:start position:0%
and when you start the survey
it

01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
indicates that this is to measure the
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
percentage of youth who practice risky
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
health behaviors
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
but i went through the past couple of um
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
yrbs high school surveys and just want
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
to read a couple of the questions from
 
01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.510 align:start position:0%
to read a couple of the questions from
that

01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
this is from 2017
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
during your life with whom have you had
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
sexual contact
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
includes males females females and males
 
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
i think some would question whether
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's uh risky behavior
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
which of the following best describes
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
you heterosexual gay or lesbian bisexual
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
or not sure
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
during the past 12 months have either of
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
your parents
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
or other adults in your family been in
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
jail or in prison i'm not sure what that
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
has to do with a student's healthy
 
01:04:32.559 --> 01:04:34.470 align:start position:0%
has to do with a student's healthy
behaviors

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
behaviors
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
during the past 12 months
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
have you talked to at least one of your
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
parents about dangers of tobacco health
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
or drug use
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
do you this is a great one do you or do
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
you have someone in your family who is
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
currently in the military
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
or no why is that on a question about
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
healthy behaviors if you're if you've
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
got a parent or a sibling in the uh
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
military that's ridiculous
 
01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.870 align:start position:0%
military that's ridiculous
um

01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
um how wrong
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.109 align:start position:0%
do you
do

01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
your parents feel it would be for you to
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
have one or two drinks of an alcoholic
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
beverage nearly every day
 
01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.950 align:start position:0%
beverage nearly every day
um

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
from 2019
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
some of the same questions
 
01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.109 align:start position:0%
some of the same questions
um

01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:27.119 --> 01:05:27.990 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
how do you describe yourself underweight
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
overweight about right etc
 
01:05:34.799 --> 01:05:38.069 align:start position:0%
overweight about right etc
uh

01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
during your life how often has there
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
been an adult in your household who
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
tried hard to make sure your basic needs
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
were met such as looking out for your
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
safety making sure you're sure you had
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
clean clothes
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.789 align:start position:0%
 
again

01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
are either of your parents
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
in your family serving on active duty in
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
those are some of the questions and i i
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
they have nothing to do
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
with uh someone's um risky behavior or
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
not um we've seen just within the past a
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
few weeks
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
the state of florida has uh
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
indicated they will cease
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
using the cdc yrbs survey they will come
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
up with their own survey instead
 
01:06:27.359 --> 01:06:28.870 align:start position:0%
up with their own survey instead
um

01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
i i think that uh
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh the parents have a right to know um
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
about these surveys
 
01:06:36.799 --> 01:06:37.829 align:start position:0%
about these surveys
um

01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
i know there have been provisions about
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
contacting i think that that
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
in many cases uh does not happen
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
according to the house version
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
i am fully
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
supportive of making this an opt-in uh
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
just as every other survey um that um
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
contains questions um along these lines
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
um are um in current law
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
um so i am in full support of the the
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
house version
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
further discussion on this
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh represent boom yeah thank you
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
received a letter an email which all the
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
others have too but it's from a doctor
 
01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.510 align:start position:0%
others have too but it's from a doctor
and

01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
his comment is based on well the
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
incident in institutional review board
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
and he said the current use risk
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
behavior survey would not pass
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
irb muster for several reasons
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
it is not a metric proven to give
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
reliable information it is not
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
controlled except by measuring the
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
current data against the data from two
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.630 align:start position:0%
years ago
the

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
rbs had not been shown to be reliable
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
and moreover it's its questions are
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
potentially harmful
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
because they can create confusion in the
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
children's mind plant ideas that may not
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
have occurred to them and invade the
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
privacy in a way that parents may not
 
01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.190 align:start position:0%
privacy in a way that parents may not
approve

01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
approve
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's an experiment with no
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
defined goal and there's more but and
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
basically it should be opt in that's
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
what my bill had said and we've been
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
fighting this for years
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
and more so um
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
it'll be fought in the next few years
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
also because it's definitely it's a bad
 
01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:26.309 align:start position:0%
also because it's definitely it's a bad
survey

01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
survey
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
this one at least two-thirds of the
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
students don't answer it correctly
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
it's a joke to them it's not anonymous
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
but the first seven questions you can
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
pretty much determine who the student is
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
and to my thing it should be just
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
abolished period just like when
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
are there any points in
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
in in various versions that we can come
 
01:08:51.679 --> 01:08:52.390 align:start position:0%
in in various versions that we can come
to

01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
agreement on
 
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.110 align:start position:0%
agreement on
um

01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
i'll start it out perhaps by saying i do
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
concur with the idea that a 14-day
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
notice is better than
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
what we previously have in there of 10
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
days notice of letting parents be
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
notified and getting this
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
out to them
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be administered in
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
the school and it can be done
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
is there anybody objects to that portion
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
no okay so i i think we can jump by that
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
there's another portion that was in the
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
uh board uh in the uh house
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
version said that the local school
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
district board shall annually approve
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just address that for a
 
01:09:43.839 --> 01:09:46.309 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just address that for a
second

01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
putting it at the local level
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
to make that decision
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to go forward with
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
this or not it would be a decision of
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
the select board or not select by the
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
school board
 
01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.350 align:start position:0%
school board
um

01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
so can we have a little discussion on
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
that please yes represent a question
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
do you have any
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
sorry do you have any idea how often
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
that has happened that a local school
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
board has actually said no we're not
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
going to do the survey
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
i don't have that information i don't
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
know it's if it's even been done
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
i know that the survey is received by
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
department of education and they
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
have a bank questions which they can use
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
and they go through it and some they
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
take some they don't take and they
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's what we use in the state
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
but then it's funneled down to the
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
districts to administer
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh in accordance with statute that we
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
have um
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that the decision has
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
been made no we're not going to do that
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
by a school board i haven't heard of
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
that i've read about that
 
01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.750 align:start position:0%
that i've read about that
um

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
this is what
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
the house version proposes
 
01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.149 align:start position:0%
the house version proposes
that

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:54.159 --> 01:10:55.430 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
the local school district board shel
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
shall annually
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
make a decision whether we're moving
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
forward with it or not
 
01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:03.590 align:start position:0%
forward with it or not
yes

01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay then i spoke with i believe she was
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
a clinician yesterday had a very lengthy
 
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.149 align:start position:0%
a clinician yesterday had a very lengthy
conversation

01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
and she said that in the beginning of
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
the school year each family they get
 
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
a letter
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
telling them what might happen during
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
the school year and then write
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
a blanket permission
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
and that was assumed to be permission
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
for whatever the school decided to do
 
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
including the surveys
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
and that question wouldn't it be better
 
01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
to get in touch with the parents before
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
or closer to the time you have a server
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
when you know that a lot of parents are
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
objecting to it
 
01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:40.709 align:start position:0%
objecting to it
and

01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
she said i might be nice but they
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
by signing this letter they had actually
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
given permission for the school to do
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
whatever needed to be done during the
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
i i certainly
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
would be very concerned about uh any
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
kind of blanket
 
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.189 align:start position:0%
kind of blanket
permission

01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
permission
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
from a parent
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
done at the
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
start of the school year and i am not
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
sure if
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
any local school boards
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
do a review
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
to approve or disapprove of the survey
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of that because it it is
 
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
so i've just handed out a sheet of paper
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
and i don't think i had enough to go
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
around all the way but i'll read
 
01:12:37.199 --> 01:12:38.950 align:start position:0%
around all the way but i'll read
if

01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
if this is a consideration at all
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that it be added to and
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
we accede to the senate version but add
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
into it
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
language which which would say the local
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
school district board shall annually
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
approve the risk behavior survey and
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
upon approval parents shall be provided
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to review the
 
01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:59.030 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to review the
questionnaire

01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
questionnaire
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
prior to distribution of the survey
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
students shall be reminded that euthyris
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
survey is voluntary
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
that is language which i would suggest
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
that would come from the from the house
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
side to and we would accede to the
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
senate version
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.430 align:start position:0%
 
perhaps

01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
also i have a problem with the senate
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
version also with the language where it
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:42.149 align:start position:0%
 
survey

01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
and it also
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
lower cases use risks i mean that's the
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
name of the survey and it shouldn't be
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
in lower case but don't that's my
 
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
concern with the senate version also
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're not mentioning that it's a
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
center for the disease control
 
01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.630 align:start position:0%
center for the disease control
survey

01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
survey
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
which i think is definitely needed
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
the red version left out the word youth
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
it's youth risk behavior survey was done
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
very rapidly
 
01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.350 align:start position:0%
very rapidly
um

01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
so there's several issues that have been
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
brought up uh
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
senator ward i'll just have a comment
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
because i think in the senate version
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
you'll find
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
that written and electronic verification
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
and also talks about for review by
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
students parents
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment that we have
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's very similar to what's already in
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
the senate version
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
school did this district make such
 
01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
surveys question available at the school
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
and and on the school in the school
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
district's website for review by
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
students parents and legal guardian
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
and provide in addition provide written
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
electronic notification to addresses
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
known by the district at the time of
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
notification prior to distribution to
 
01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:57.750 align:start position:0%
notification prior to distribution to
students

01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me that's already covered
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
in the senate version
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
what uh the house
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
suggested language here is that
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
the survey be approved by the local
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
school board and upon approval then that
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
approved survey would be available
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh for parental review of that
 
01:15:19.679 --> 01:15:21.189 align:start position:0%
uh for parental review of that
questionnaire

01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
questionnaire
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
so it's it's uh not sayings that you can
 
01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
just hand it out as maybe it comes down
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
from doe
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
you'd have to approve it as a board and
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
then to
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate that this would
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
i can't project but i can give you my uh
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
opinion that
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
if this survey is so important
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
administer it
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
on a
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
opt-out basis to students of which i
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
know many parents at home never received
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
that survey never review the survey
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
and just
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
school says do it we do it they comply
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
um i i think if it's that important that
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
for all these agencies and organizations
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
which have said we use this information
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
and not quibbling with that i understand
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
then it's it's important enough then
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
that the person that we're serving the
 
01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.550 align:start position:0%
that the person that we're serving the
child

01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
which the the
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
guardian and legal guardian of that
 
01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:51.669 align:start position:0%
guardian and legal guardian of that
child

01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
is the parent
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
or maybe the state
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
they should have the opportunity also to
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know through their elected
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
representation decide whether we want
 
01:17:05.199 --> 01:17:06.149 align:start position:0%
representation decide whether we want
this

01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
administered or not administered and
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's important enough that when you do
 
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
it at a local board meeting then
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
it's more notice is going to be going
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
maybe the committee said we love it we
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
want it
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
but i can't tell you whether it would
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
change your statistics your outcomes or
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
not i do know that
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
information i read uh must mean about
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
seven or eight years ago regarding this
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
when we first started talking about this
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
is that the statistical difference
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
between opt out and opt-in doesn't
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
change it enough so it ruins the the
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
outcome of the survey
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
and i've heard people say oh no that's
 
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
not so but that the data i looked at
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
just said that it's just that that you
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
will see fewer responses of course if
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's opt in however the the outcomes are
 
01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:55.910 align:start position:0%
it's opt in however the the outcomes are
still

01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
pretty much within three or four points
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
of of where it would have been doing it
 
01:18:00.159 --> 01:18:00.950 align:start position:0%
of of where it would have been doing it
by

01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman i just to continue there
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
the two things uh one i think that
 
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.430 align:start position:0%
the two things uh one i think that
that's

01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.590 align:start position:0%
that's
been

01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
addressed in testimony
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
the difference in participation rates
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
are fast
 
01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:20.790 align:start position:0%
are fast
uh

01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
between an 85 to 90 percent
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
participation rate versus a 30
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
participation rate that's pretty
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
significant to me
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
we have heard from
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
our significant state agencies the
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
health and human services and education
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
that this is an important statewide
 
01:18:43.679 --> 01:18:45.430 align:start position:0%
that this is an important statewide
marker

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
marker
 
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
i think we want to know if we are
 
01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
looking like west virginia or florida or
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
a neighboring new england states
 
01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.390 align:start position:0%
a neighboring new england states
and

01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:57.590 align:start position:0%
and
uh

01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
that's what this
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
survey enables our state to be able to
 
01:19:03.679 --> 01:19:04.550 align:start position:0%
survey enables our state to be able to
do

01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
it enables them to uh
 
01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
risk behaviors
 
01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.110 align:start position:0%
risk behaviors
and

01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
this suggested amendment is not
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh going to
 
01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.910 align:start position:0%
uh going to
improve

01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
improve
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh the services
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
that those agencies do in fact i believe
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
that it will be detrimental
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
so my position
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
if it's an important marker why then do
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
we object to the elected officials
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
within that community making that
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.630 align:start position:0%
 
again

01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
something that we administer on a
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
statewide basis
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
and i believe that it produces
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
information of value to our state
 
01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.430 align:start position:0%
information of value to our state
and

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
i i think that that amendment
 
01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:13.990 align:start position:0%
i i think that that amendment
is

01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
is intended
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
to uh and and the end result would be
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
less participation
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh and it
 
01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:25.750 align:start position:0%
uh and it
will

01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
inhibit the effectiveness of and
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
validity of the information
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
if the school board has responsibility
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
for approving curriculum used in the
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
schools which they do have
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
then why does the school board not have
 
01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:47.830 align:start position:0%
then why does the school board not have
authority

01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
to decide whether this survey is used or
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
not used
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
i i just don't get it for some things
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
those good elected officials are good
 
01:20:55.199 --> 01:20:56.229 align:start position:0%
those good elected officials are good
for

01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
and others like this
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
you will do as you know
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
as it comes out of doe and doe doesn't
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
write curriculum
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
or instruction they do academic
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
so i think there's a disconnect here
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
between you know local ability to make
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
these decisions and
 
01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:18.470 align:start position:0%
these decisions and
and

01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
where we are right now with this statute
 
01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.310 align:start position:0%
where we are right now with this statute
yes

01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
represent hops
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
i believe that parents are becoming more
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
and more intolerant of their children's
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
information and their family's
 
01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.229 align:start position:0%
information and their family's
information

01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh being subjected to public
 
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
domains and we have a constitutional
 
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.070 align:start position:0%
domains and we have a constitutional
amendment

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
giving us a right to privacy
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
so i think it would be beneficial
 
01:21:53.679 --> 01:21:54.870 align:start position:0%
so i think it would be beneficial
to

01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
work with parents and school boards
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
to give them as much information as
 
01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:00.950 align:start position:0%
to give them as much information as
possible

01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
so that these students participate in
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
the programs and in the academic
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
non-academic surveys
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
because parents are more and more opting
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
so i i i think the positions are pretty
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
well known here where we are
 
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.629 align:start position:0%
well known here where we are
um

01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
is there a need for a caucus on the part
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
on either side i i know there's not on
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
welcome back are we ready to progress as
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
do you have any kind of representative
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
hennessy senator excuse me well you were
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
a rep once
 
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
mom senator you you left the good side
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
so we have um
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
we have some comments on your proposed
 
01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:47.750 align:start position:0%
we have some comments on your proposed
agenda

01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
agenda amendment sorry
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
um we are not opposed to putting
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.159 --> 01:34:58.830 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:34:58.830 --> 01:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.790 align:start position:0%
in
into

01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
the language
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
um and we are not opposed to the last
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
sentence where it says prior to
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
distribution of the survey students
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
shall be reminded that the youth risk
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
survey is voluntary i believe that's in
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
the instructions for the survey and that
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
they're already read that
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
we do have a concern about the local
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
school district shall annually approve
 
01:35:23.590 --> 01:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
the risk behavior survey
 
01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.870 align:start position:0%
the risk behavior survey
um

01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
one timing wise
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
this goes in effect upon passage i don't
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
the timing wise would be okay two
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
i don't believe this is administered
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
annually is that correct i believe it's
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
every two years
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
three what happens if the school board
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
forgets to put it on one of their
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
agendas but they
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
do want to administer the survey
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
to their students because
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
for example many of the high schools in
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
my district receive funding to prevent
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
suicide because the survey has
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
identified several of my
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
high schools being
 
01:36:09.109 --> 01:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
very unfortunately
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
kids admit that they think about suicide
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
so if one of my high schools forgets to
 
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
approve it at the
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
school board level then their funding
 
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
for suicide prevention would be at risk
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
so we would prefer that that sentence
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
not be added into it
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
discussion or response from the
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:46.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
realizing that you know maybe the opt-in
 
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
would be an issue for the committee um i
 
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
i feel for my support um it would
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
and we're willing to take the word
 
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
annually out
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
the local school district shall approve
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
the youth risk behavior survey
 
01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:48.870 align:start position:0%
the youth risk behavior survey
period

01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.709 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
again i i think that that is not
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
acceptable to me i think that
 
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.990 align:start position:0%
acceptable to me i think that
uh

01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know it it's not
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
likely once you lose that
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
continuity of data
 
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
and the data points
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh the value of this goes down
 
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
significantly number one on a local
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
basis and number two
 
01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:17.350 align:start position:0%
basis and number two
this

01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
does not
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
provide a statewide view
 
01:38:23.119 --> 01:38:24.070 align:start position:0%
provide a statewide view
of

01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:29.109 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
i i i think it is not
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
to me it's not adding value
 
01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:36.870 align:start position:0%
to me it's not adding value
to

01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
the reason why we do this survey
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
and so it's not an acceptable change for
 
01:38:44.639 --> 01:38:45.669 align:start position:0%
and so it's not an acceptable change for
me

01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
would the data be changed it would
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
simply be that the same survey would be
 
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
used for
 
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
every school district but a approved
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
upon approval and then that data would
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
be sent to the department of education
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
and compiled
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
so the data is going to be the same data
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
you would have as many people
 
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
participating in as you do now if all
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
our school boards saw that there's value
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
to it and
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
and uh they may hear that type of uh
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
input from their their membership there
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
and from
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
organizations within the community as
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
well i mean it's a survey right now that
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
we know very clearly annually
 
01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh when i mean sorry every every two
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
years when it's administered since 1993
 
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh we know that the completion rate on
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
the survey is 85 to 90 percent
 
01:39:46.239 --> 01:39:47.109 align:start position:0%
the survey is 85 to 90 percent
uh

01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:47.119 --> 01:39:48.229 align:start position:0%
uh
we

01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
inevitably will lead to a less than 85
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
to 90 percent completion rate across the
 
01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.270 align:start position:0%
to 90 percent completion rate across the
state

01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
has a negative impact on the value of
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
the survey
 
01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:05.750 align:start position:0%
the survey
so

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
is that a bad thing that if if if a a
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
local board decides we don't want to a
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
minute is
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
i guess that would be the response to
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
the people that would be a response of
 
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
the elected officials in that particular
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
community that are reflecting the the
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
input from citizens of that community
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
if it's something that's a wonderful
 
01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:26.629 align:start position:0%
if it's something that's a wonderful
thing

01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
and has a lot of merit for the
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
rationale for giving it uh then uh it
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
will probably be perceived that way by
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
the community uh i i can't understand
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
why if if if we're saying well the the
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
school board won't do this
 
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
but we're going to make them do it
 
01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:46.390 align:start position:0%
but we're going to make them do it
uh

01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
i i i think it's just you know putting
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
the the elected officials that are been
 
01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
elected to run that school district in
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
missed the back seat of the car metaphor
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
but uh leaving that aside the
 
01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
the i mean this this isn't a debate
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
about local control for me and this is a
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
debate about
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
the value of this data on a statewide
 
01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
basis and i mean if we want to talk
 
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
about local control
 
01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of issues that we could
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
bring up that came up during this
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
legislative session where local control
 
01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:25.750 align:start position:0%
legislative session where local control
wasn't

01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
a primary
 
01:41:27.119 --> 01:41:29.189 align:start position:0%
a primary
consideration

01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:41:29.199 --> 01:41:31.270 align:start position:0%
consideration
so

01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's that's not it
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
this is a question for me
 
01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:36.950 align:start position:0%
this is a question for me
about

01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
a completion rate on a statewide basis
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
that enables
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
the state to have data
 
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
and to
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
be able to then use that data
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
to target dollars and requests for
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
to

01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
address specific behaviors identified in
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
represent cornelli thank you i would
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
just say
 
01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:08.629 align:start position:0%
just say
from

01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
my perspective
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh parental control is a lot more
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
important than any dollars
 
01:42:16.159 --> 01:42:20.070 align:start position:0%
important than any dollars
involvement

01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:21.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
folks here
 
01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:29.669 align:start position:0%
folks here
the

01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:29.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
yes or something represent senator word
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me i'm sorry
 
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
the people i have spoken with
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
some of the questions may be
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
objectionable to some but i think we
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
have to look at the whole value for the
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
state for the people who are dealing
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
with some of the problems that we are
 
01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:47.830 align:start position:0%
with some of the problems that we are
encountering

01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
encountering
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of issues with the teens
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
and the young people in our state
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
and if this helps to
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
figure out where this thing is occurring
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
what the issues are
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
i can see this
 
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
server being of value there are some
 
01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions in there that i do not like
 
01:43:08.950 --> 01:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
but i think overall i think we have to
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
take a look at the what is the big gains
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
further further discussion
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative yeah without the local
 
01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
control i'm
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
not for this
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
so that that is the position of the
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
house and so if you're non-concurring
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh the the local control
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think we're going to agree on
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
mr do we need to take a vote then on
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.679 --> 01:43:51.109 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
all those that on this on the house side
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
for non-concur
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
so we would be voting on non-concurring
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
with the house's position or
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
we're not going to agree with either one
 
01:44:12.719 --> 01:44:15.109 align:start position:0%
we're not going to agree with either one
okay

01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's unfortunate i would hope that we
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
can give our parents some
 
01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
that was our intent
 
01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:28.639 align:start position:0%
the current law still stands yeah yeah
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
so it'd be just as is right now
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
so with with that that is your response
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
yes we do not conquer we concur with the
 
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%

that's right i don't have to write
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.800 --> 02:02:00.470 align:start position:0%

of a number of

was heavily involved in in drafting this
 
02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:21.669 align:start position:0%
was heavily involved in in drafting this
and

02:03:21.669 --> 02:03:21.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
tried to do
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
certain things in this amendment
 
02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
namely to specify
 
02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:31.189 align:start position:0%
namely to specify
um

02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
what this program administrator's
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
position would be
 
02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
um and you'll see that in line seven of
 
02:03:42.070 --> 02:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment it's a level two
 
02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:43.510 align:start position:0%
the amendment it's a level two
administrator

02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
02:03:47.430 --> 02:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
um and then it goes on to try and define
 
02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
what the duties and responsibilities of
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
this position um would be
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
um there had been concern um in
 
02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:57.189 align:start position:0%
um there had been concern um in
the

02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:03:59.350 --> 02:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
prior versions
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
that had been passed by the house and
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
senate that it was
 
02:04:06.910 --> 02:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
kind of open-ended in terms of the
 
02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:10.719 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the position might
 
02:04:12.629 --> 02:04:12.639 align:start position:0%
conflict with the scholarship
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
organization or organizations
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
administering the program
 
02:04:19.010 --> 02:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
and also
 
02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:20.229 align:start position:0%
and also
[Music]

02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
opened the door for future
 
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
um addition of of monies um
 
02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
under the category of the administrator
 
02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to tighten that up and not
 
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
make it open-ended but
 
02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:36.550 align:start position:0%
make it open-ended but
define

02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
define
 
02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:37.510 align:start position:0%
define
what

02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:38.790 align:start position:0%
what
um

02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
dollars would be associated with this
 
02:04:43.510 --> 02:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
position um going forward into the
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
future so i think that that's um
 
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
what we tried to do in uh
 
02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:57.430 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
tighten up what the administration
 
02:05:01.990 --> 02:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
administrator will do
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
it had been a problem
 
02:05:06.550 --> 02:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
we know that this past year was startup
 
02:05:08.069 --> 02:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
and as always
 
02:05:08.079 --> 02:05:09.589 align:start position:0%
and as always
additional

02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
work required with any startup program
 
02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:14.629 align:start position:0%
work required with any startup program
uh

02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
but even going on into the future there
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
was work that is required both by the
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization
 
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
in the application process
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
but with the department
 
02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
as with
 
02:05:31.589 --> 02:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
any school or program
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
their responsibility is to make sure
 
02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
there's no duplication
 
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
so that there would be no efa student
 
02:05:42.550 --> 02:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
who's also listed by a school as being
 
02:05:44.550 --> 02:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
enrolled in that school
 
02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
so they do a lot of work in that regard
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
and um someone is here from the
 
02:05:50.229 --> 02:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
department if there are any questions
 
02:05:50.239 --> 02:05:51.270 align:start position:0%
department if there are any questions
also

02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:05:55.350 --> 02:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
is uh online uh starting on line 22
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
and the money would come out of the
 
02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:02.709 align:start position:0%
and the money would come out of the
treasury

02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
via warrant by the governor for this
 
02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:06.950 align:start position:0%
via warrant by the governor for this
position

02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:06:11.189 --> 02:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
and this will take effect july 1 so that
 
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully the person can be hired and
 
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
help with
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
the program um in the fall and the start
 
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
of the school year
 
02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
you could have given us the cliff note
 
02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
version i'm sorry sorry
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh senator bradley
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh can i ask representative cordelia a
 
02:06:31.990 --> 02:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
couple of questions
 
02:06:34.069 --> 02:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
so as i understand that the
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
rationale for making a general fund
 
02:06:38.229 --> 02:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation as opposed to taking it
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
02:06:42.550 --> 02:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
10 allocation is that
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
the 10 allocation is
 
02:06:48.390 --> 02:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
necessary for a scholarship organization
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
um to be able to run the program and the
 
02:06:54.149 --> 02:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
prospect of
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
not only the administrator but
 
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
potentially other future
 
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
administrative expenses coming out of
 
02:07:04.390 --> 02:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
the 10 percent would undermine the
 
02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:05.669 align:start position:0%
the 10 percent would undermine the
ability

02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
ability
 
02:07:08.229 --> 02:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
to operate the scholarship organization
 
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
is that is that the rationale behind
 
02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:11.589 align:start position:0%
is that is that the rationale behind
this

02:07:11.589 --> 02:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
that is part of it
 
02:07:13.199 --> 02:07:14.550 align:start position:0%
that is part of it
also

02:07:14.550 --> 02:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
when funds are disbursed to an efa
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
account um the scholarship
 
02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
organization can withhold uh 10 of that
 
02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:23.910 align:start position:0%
organization can withhold uh 10 of that
amount

02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
amount
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:26.709 align:start position:0%
so um
if

02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
it is required
 
02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:30.310 align:start position:0%
it is required
that

02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:31.189 align:start position:0%
that
the

02:07:31.189 --> 02:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:33.189 --> 02:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
cost of this position
 
02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
come out of that were
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
basically reducing by a little bit the
 
02:07:40.950 --> 02:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
money that would go to the efa account
 
02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
for that student
 
02:07:43.599 --> 02:07:44.950 align:start position:0%
for that student
further

02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:07:49.109 --> 02:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
satisfy the
 
02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
requirement for the department of
 
02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
education to be able to do what they
 
02:07:55.990 --> 02:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
in administering
 
02:07:59.830 --> 02:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
esa's so
 
02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
this should be a
 
02:08:03.750 --> 02:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
well obviously be an ongoing expense but
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
it won't be
 
02:08:08.229 --> 02:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
an increasing expense in the future at
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
least in theory is that correct
 
02:08:10.239 --> 02:08:11.030 align:start position:0%
least in theory is that correct
uh

02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
that is correct other than any salary
 
02:08:15.669 --> 02:08:15.679 align:start position:0%
increases that are negotiated right yeah
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
right yeah um
 
02:08:19.589 --> 02:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh so that you know that's an important
 
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
point um and i i think
 
02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:25.589 align:start position:0%
point um and i i think
that

02:08:25.589 --> 02:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
we wanted to avoid
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh any reduction to efa accounts
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
and that was the reason for the
 
02:08:34.470 --> 02:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh treasury um
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
source of funding senator prentice oh
 
02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um cheerlead so uh this
 
02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
is a question for representative
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
cordelli or
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
whoever would like to answer this you
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
say that they'll
 
02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:48.470 align:start position:0%
say that they'll
that

02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
using a general fund
 
02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
using the general fund as the the source
 
02:08:56.550 --> 02:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
of this appropriation will then
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
move any burden away potentially from
 
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
an individual student's
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
scholarship correct
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
okay correct and do we know how much
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
the scholarship scholarship amounts vary
 
02:09:15.189 --> 02:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
based on
 
02:09:17.109 --> 02:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid that the student
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
might qualify for
 
02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:21.430 align:start position:0%
might qualify for
um

02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
we have caitlin davis here and caitlin
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
could give you the specifics on that i
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
think right and i just want to mention
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
also in regard to that in terms of the
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
administrative costs costs
 
02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
one of the largest
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
costs to the scholarship organization in
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
that 10 percent
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
has been the acquisition
 
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh of access to a system called class
 
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
wallet which tracks all the expenses and
 
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's like a 30 of their
 
02:09:52.709 --> 02:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
administrative costs are to pay for
 
02:09:52.719 --> 02:09:53.589 align:start position:0%
administrative costs are to pay for
that

02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:53.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:53.599 --> 02:09:54.629 align:start position:0%
that
system

02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:09:54.639 --> 02:09:55.510 align:start position:0%
system
and

02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:59.589 --> 02:09:59.599 align:start position:0%
that will be an ongoing expense
 
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
per student
 
02:10:03.270 --> 02:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
and administrative fees on top of that
 
02:10:05.830 --> 02:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
for use of the class wallet system but
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
it's integral into the
 
02:10:11.589 --> 02:10:11.599 align:start position:0%
success of the program and other states
 
02:10:15.030 --> 02:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
with esa accounts are
 
02:10:16.229 --> 02:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
moving to
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
use class wallet or similar systems uh
 
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
now also
 
02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:21.589 align:start position:0%
now also
okay

02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
i would be uh
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
i'd like to hear from the department on
 
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
what they either estimate or know is
 
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
be the cost
 
02:10:33.430 --> 02:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
to each each scholarship i know that you
 
02:10:35.669 --> 02:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
said they the different ones that there
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
could be different amounts for
 
02:10:38.790 --> 02:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
scholarships but i'd like to understand
 
02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:54.310 --> 02:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record i'm caitlin
 
02:10:56.550 --> 02:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
davis from the department of education
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
um the base efa scholarship amount is
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
the same amount that just
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
can you speak a little louder
 
02:11:04.239 --> 02:11:05.350 align:start position:0%
can you speak a little louder
amplify

02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
amplify
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
the base amount that an efa student is
 
02:11:08.950 --> 02:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
eligible for is the same amount that
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
district public school children are
 
02:11:13.109 --> 02:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
available for which in fiscal year 22 in
 
02:11:15.709 --> 02:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 is
 
02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
3786 dollars per student
 
02:11:20.709 --> 02:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
um that's the base amount so the base
 
02:11:22.950 --> 02:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
amount less the 10
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
would be i'd like to do the math of my
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
head but i can't
 
02:11:28.709 --> 02:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
caleb is a split amongst all the
 
02:11:31.990 --> 02:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
children so each efa is reduced by 10
 
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:32.950 align:start position:0%
children so each efa is reduced by 10
percent

02:11:32.950 --> 02:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:34.069 align:start position:0%
percent
um

02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
for up to a maximum of 10
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
to pay for the administrative set-aside
 
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
that goes to the scholarship
 
02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
organization so three thousand four
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
hundred and seven dollars is the amount
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
that would a child would be eligible for
 
02:11:48.149 --> 02:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
now if a child were additionally
 
02:11:49.669 --> 02:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
eligible for
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
um free and reduced lunch aid which is
 
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
one thousand eight hundred and ninety
 
02:11:56.550 --> 02:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
three dollars per kid uh so reduced by
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
ten percent so another two almost two
 
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and that
 
02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
instance would be part of the ten
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
percent that would make up the amount
 
02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
that the scholarship organization is
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive to administer the
 
02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:09.350 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive to administer the
grants

02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
grants
 
02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:13.750 align:start position:0%
grants
okay

02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead
 
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's more of a statement than a question
 
02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
but i'll
 
02:12:20.229 --> 02:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
make i'll share this while you're you're
 
02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
sitting with us it's been my experience
 
02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
in in other
 
02:12:26.470 --> 02:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
say grant programs like federal grant
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
programs that i have been a part of
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
receiving and administering whether in
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
the public or the private sector that
 
02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
you receive a whole amount and then
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
there is a percentage of that amount
 
02:12:37.030 --> 02:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
that you receive
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
that will go to the administration of
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
the program so i see this as being
 
02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
somewhat similar and that is my concern
 
02:12:45.589 --> 02:12:45.599 align:start position:0%
was my concern on the senate side of
 
02:12:49.109 --> 02:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
this in in working on how we amended it
 
02:12:52.149 --> 02:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
and senate education was because that
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
that to me is part of the the package
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
you receive it you have your costs for
 
02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
administration within that
 
02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
and that though
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
these things need to be thought about up
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
front so i just don't think it's an
 
02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
unusual practice to have a grant have an
 
02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
administration fee within that grant so
 
02:13:12.390 --> 02:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
now we're trying to move around the
 
02:13:14.149 --> 02:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
senate's position and really essentially
 
02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
backfill the scholarship organization
 
02:13:18.870 --> 02:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
part of this i don't want children to
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
have any less than they would have but i
 
02:13:21.750 --> 02:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
also think that children who are
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
attending public schools in new
 
02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:23.910 align:start position:0%
attending public schools in new
hampshire

02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:13:25.589 --> 02:13:25.599 align:start position:0%
have less and are going to continue to
 
02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
have less if this if we continue down
 
02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
this pathway that's my position um and i
 
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
believe it aligns with the senate
 
02:13:34.149 --> 02:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
position at least in how we amended this
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
caitlin is it fair to say that of that
 
02:13:40.709 --> 02:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
10 percent if you don't use it all for
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
administration the money is plowed back
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
into future other scholarship awards for
 
02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:46.310 align:start position:0%
into future other scholarship awards for
students

02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
i believe it goes back directly to the
 
02:13:50.310 --> 02:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
student that was reduced by that amount
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
so not future amounts but the
 
02:13:57.990 --> 02:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
thanks kaitlyn
 
02:14:00.629 --> 02:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
for the department
 
02:14:06.149 --> 02:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:12.550 --> 02:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:15.109 --> 02:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
yes represent mullen thank you very much
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
and good morning everybody
 
02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:17.910 align:start position:0%
and good morning everybody
um

02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli in your
 
02:14:23.109 --> 02:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
amendment you have uh
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
sort of cleaned up the job description
 
02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
if you will for the education freedom
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:33.189 --> 02:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
i don't see the word oversight in this
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
job description anywhere can i assume
 
02:14:39.270 --> 02:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
is it fair for me to assume them that
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
roman 3 on line 18
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
when you say implement policies and
 
02:14:46.229 --> 02:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
procedures at the department related to
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
the education freedom account program
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
that that would include
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
oversight of
 
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
the various touch points that this uh
 
02:15:00.149 --> 02:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
administrator would have with other
 
02:15:00.159 --> 02:15:02.550 align:start position:0%
administrator would have with other
staff

02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:04.790 --> 02:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh yes i believe that that would include
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
things like the administrative rules
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
that have been put in place in any
 
02:15:10.550 --> 02:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
modification of those rules in the
 
02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:11.589 align:start position:0%
modification of those rules in the
future

02:15:11.589 --> 02:15:11.599 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
related to the program
 
02:15:15.430 --> 02:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
and i think there's also
 
02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
in the rsas that we passed related to
 
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
this there are
 
02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
oversight capabilities both for the
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
department and the legislative committee
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:37.030 --> 02:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much mr chair um even
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
though it is
 
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
a different approach than the senate
 
02:15:43.990 --> 02:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
version for the bill i think that
 
02:15:46.550 --> 02:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
um representative cordelia has done an
 
02:15:49.030 --> 02:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
excellent job of outlining
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh the need and how this would function
 
02:15:52.079 --> 02:15:52.950 align:start position:0%
uh the need and how this would function
i

02:15:52.950 --> 02:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:15:55.750 --> 02:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that representative cordelli
 
02:15:57.030 --> 02:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
worked with
 
02:16:02.149 --> 02:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
the education department on this i think
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
we all knew that
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
greater oversight will not oversight but
 
02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:09.510 align:start position:0%
greater oversight will not oversight but
um

02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:13.390 align:start position:0%
um
administrative

02:16:13.390 --> 02:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
administration of this program was
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
necessary so the question is how do you
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
pay for it i think that
 
02:16:22.870 --> 02:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know where this might be somewhat
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
different than
 
02:16:26.229 --> 02:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
you know the circumstance that
 
02:16:26.239 --> 02:16:27.189 align:start position:0%
you know the circumstance that
um

02:16:27.189 --> 02:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
senator apprentice was talking about is
 
02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
the point that was just made
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
any savings in the 10
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
goes back to the individual kid and so
 
02:16:42.629 --> 02:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
therefore i i think i can accept the
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
house position on this
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that we all saw that there
 
02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
was a need for the administrator
 
02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:50.950 align:start position:0%
was a need for the administrator
position

02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:16:53.429 --> 02:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
and i can accept the funding
 
02:16:56.309 --> 02:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
proposed in here because
 
02:16:58.870 --> 02:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
any excess dollars go back to the kids
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
so i i think glenn you did an excellent
 
02:17:01.359 --> 02:17:04.629 align:start position:0%
so i i think glenn you did an excellent
job

02:17:04.629 --> 02:17:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:07.429 --> 02:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
this uh was done i believe we had a
 
02:17:09.509 --> 02:17:09.519 align:start position:0%
two-hour meeting over at granite state
 
02:17:12.309 --> 02:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
with folks with the department
 
02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of discussion a lot of
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
plowing around trying to figure out
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
to get away from the laundry list but to
 
02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
get into specifics it's kind of
 
02:17:23.509 --> 02:17:23.519 align:start position:0%
summarize it and i think that you're
 
02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
correct senator i think this is a good
 
02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
general overview of the program and will
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
get us on the road to having
 
02:17:32.389 --> 02:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
some coordination from the department
 
02:17:32.399 --> 02:17:33.349 align:start position:0%
some coordination from the department
itself

02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
itself
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
in the efi program
 
02:17:37.990 --> 02:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:17:43.349 --> 02:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
so are we at the position where we need

while i'm not
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
questioning the decision of the senate i
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
would just like to make mention of the
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
feeding hungry children is
 
02:21:45.349 --> 02:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
that we need to confront in new
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire and it has come before
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
at least the house
 
02:21:54.950 --> 02:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
multiple times over the past couple of
 
02:21:56.389 --> 02:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
years and
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
while i understand that there were some
 
02:22:01.429 --> 02:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
concerns about the sort of trial aspect
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
of the direct certification process
 
02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
i would like to see us taking an active
 
02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
role in feeding hungry children moving
 
02:22:10.960 --> 02:22:12.070 align:start position:0%
role in feeding hungry children moving
forward

02:22:12.070 --> 02:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:22:15.030 --> 02:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%

and it passed out of the senate i
 
06:02:58.708 --> 06:02:58.718 align:start position:0%

and
 
06:03:02.070 --> 06:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
what the problem is
 
06:03:06.070 --> 06:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's a nationwide problem so far we have
 
06:03:07.990 --> 06:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
the two latest states that have passed
 
06:03:09.270 --> 06:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:03:10.470 --> 06:03:10.480 align:start position:0%

06:03:16.230 --> 06:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
we also have i believe colorado alabama
 
06:03:20.548 --> 06:03:20.558 align:start position:0%
and what it does is it um
 
06:03:22.470 --> 06:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
the problem that's been happening is
 
06:03:25.270 --> 06:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's a 500 billion dollar problem in
 
06:03:26.948 --> 06:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
this country where
 
06:03:29.430 --> 06:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh you've been hearing about the uh
 
06:03:30.948 --> 06:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
smashing grabs
 
06:03:33.270 --> 06:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
um a lot of these places are doing smash
 
06:03:35.910 --> 06:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
and grabs they're selling this stuff on
 
06:03:37.590 --> 06:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
online marketing
 
06:03:41.030 --> 06:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does is it requires
 
06:03:43.670 --> 06:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
the online marketers only
 
06:03:43.680 --> 06:03:46.628 align:start position:0%
the online marketers only
to

06:03:46.628 --> 06:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:49.990 --> 06:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
vet their third party providers to make
 
06:03:51.990 --> 06:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
sure that they are
 
06:03:52.000 --> 06:03:53.270 align:start position:0%
sure that they are
legitimate

06:03:53.270 --> 06:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
06:03:56.788 --> 06:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
um third-party vendors for them
 
06:04:00.390 --> 06:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
in july 18 2019
 
06:04:01.750 --> 06:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
for those that don't believe it happens
 
06:04:03.110 --> 06:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
06:04:04.868 --> 06:04:04.878 align:start position:0%
detectives in manchester netted more
 
06:04:07.670 --> 06:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
than 400 pieces of new box products
 
06:04:10.070 --> 06:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
including tools and electronics which
 
06:04:12.150 --> 06:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
were reportedly stolen several of the
 
06:04:14.310 --> 06:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
criminals involved in the organized
 
06:04:16.150 --> 06:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
retail crime scheme would sell the
 
06:04:18.868 --> 06:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
stolen products online for profit so
 
06:04:22.310 --> 06:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
this does happen in new hampshire
 
06:04:24.628 --> 06:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
and what it does what the bill does is
 
06:04:28.310 --> 06:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
require that the third party sellers
 
06:04:29.990 --> 06:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
who fit the definition of the bill of
 
06:04:32.470 --> 06:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
high volume meaning they make 200 or
 
06:04:35.190 --> 06:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
more transactions sell more than five
 
06:04:37.030 --> 06:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars worth of new
 
06:04:39.750 --> 06:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
merchandise um
 
06:04:42.070 --> 06:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
they need to be vetted and basically
 
06:04:43.990 --> 06:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
getting their it requires online
 
06:04:46.470 --> 06:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
marketer to collect information from the
 
06:04:50.628 --> 06:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:50.638 --> 06:04:53.670 align:start position:0%
 
their

06:04:53.670 --> 06:04:53.680 align:start position:0%

06:05:03.270 --> 06:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
is cover for the for the attorney
 
06:05:06.230 --> 06:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
general in their consumer protection
 
06:05:09.270 --> 06:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
arena so that when they go to the third
 
06:05:11.510 --> 06:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
party if they get complaints
 
06:05:13.990 --> 06:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
of 30 on
 
06:05:15.750 --> 06:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
the online marketers
 
06:05:18.948 --> 06:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
the ag can subpoena or can get that
 
06:05:18.958 --> 06:05:20.150 align:start position:0%
the ag can subpoena or can get that
information

06:05:20.150 --> 06:05:20.160 align:start position:0%

law
 
06:05:27.030 --> 06:05:27.040 align:start position:0%

06:05:29.430 --> 06:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
get that information from the online
 
06:05:31.830 --> 06:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
marketers without that informa without
 
06:05:34.310 --> 06:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
the bill passing the um there's a good
 
06:05:36.708 --> 06:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
chance that the online marketers do not
 
06:05:41.270 --> 06:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:42.948 --> 06:05:42.958 align:start position:0%

06:06:00.110 --> 06:06:01.830 align:start position:0%
the um counter
[Music]

06:06:01.830 --> 06:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:06:03.590 --> 06:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
baby formulas
 
06:06:05.990 --> 06:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
and things that are online so
 
06:06:07.430 --> 06:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
06:06:09.990 --> 06:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
pretty much a consumer protection
 
06:06:12.548 --> 06:06:12.558 align:start position:0%
um but it all doesn't require us to do
 
06:06:14.150 --> 06:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
anything it does require the online
 
06:06:16.708 --> 06:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
marketers to do it um some of the online
 
06:06:18.788 --> 06:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
marketers are doing it on their own
 
06:06:20.390 --> 06:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
some are not
 
06:06:22.470 --> 06:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
um this is a bill that
 
06:06:26.628 --> 06:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
um we amended it to match the language
 
06:06:28.708 --> 06:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
that the feds have
 
06:06:31.270 --> 06:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
um but this a lot of the states are
 
06:06:33.030 --> 06:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
trying to push it through their states
 
06:06:34.948 --> 06:06:34.958 align:start position:0%
because they don't trust the feds to be
 
06:06:36.628 --> 06:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
able to get it through
 
06:06:38.628 --> 06:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
and this is a protection for our
 
06:06:41.910 --> 06:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
constituents so with that mr chair i
 
06:06:43.190 --> 06:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
will um
 
06:06:45.270 --> 06:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions
 
06:06:47.350 --> 06:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering how do we enforce it i
 
06:06:48.948 --> 06:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
know there's been some times when
 
06:06:51.110 --> 06:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's been a a problem with an
 
06:06:53.910 --> 06:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
out-of-state bank and we learned that we
 
06:06:55.190 --> 06:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
really couldn't do anything because it
 
06:06:57.830 --> 06:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
was out of state uh what if one of these
 
06:07:00.470 --> 06:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
online platforms is cited in another
 
06:07:00.480 --> 06:07:02.628 align:start position:0%
online platforms is cited in another
state

06:07:02.628 --> 06:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:07:04.390 --> 06:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
somebody in new hampshire may buy off
 
06:07:06.390 --> 06:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
that platform but how do we have
 
06:07:10.390 --> 06:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:11.750 --> 06:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
06:07:13.830 --> 06:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's up to the marketing
 
06:07:16.708 --> 06:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
the online marketer to police their own
 
06:07:18.788 --> 06:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
what happens is the attorney general
 
06:07:21.030 --> 06:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
will get complaints
 
06:07:22.948 --> 06:07:22.958 align:start position:0%
and then they will go
 
06:07:25.670 --> 06:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
ask the online marketer in amazon or a
 
06:07:28.150 --> 06:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
home depot or a walmart
 
06:07:34.070 --> 06:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:35.510 --> 06:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
and what
 
06:07:37.590 --> 06:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
should this bill this part of the bill
 
06:07:37.600 --> 06:07:39.110 align:start position:0%
should this bill this part of the bill
pass

06:07:39.110 --> 06:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
pass
 
06:07:39.120 --> 06:07:41.670 align:start position:0%
pass
um

06:07:41.670 --> 06:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:43.430 --> 06:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
who sues whom
 
06:07:43.440 --> 06:07:44.548 align:start position:0%
who sues whom
who

06:07:44.548 --> 06:07:44.558 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:07:49.190 --> 06:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:51.830 --> 06:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
i'm presuming the a.g would go after the
 
06:07:53.670 --> 06:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
third-party event try and go after the
 
06:07:55.510 --> 06:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
third party vendor if there are enough
 
06:07:57.750 --> 06:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
complaints in new hampshire
 
06:08:00.230 --> 06:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
if the third party vendors company is
 
06:08:02.868 --> 06:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
registered in let's say michigan and has
 
06:08:06.070 --> 06:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
a home office in say maryland or so on
 
06:08:07.510 --> 06:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
and the only
 
06:08:09.430 --> 06:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
connection to new hampshire is somebody
 
06:08:10.948 --> 06:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire went online and bought
 
06:08:13.030 --> 06:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
a product and got it in the mail
 
06:08:15.750 --> 06:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
how can we
 
06:08:20.390 --> 06:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:20.400 --> 06:08:22.628 align:start position:0%
 
i'm

06:08:22.628 --> 06:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
06:08:25.190 --> 06:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
you could bring um jim demers up here
 
06:08:26.788 --> 06:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
yeah jim information come on up mr
 
06:08:26.798 --> 06:08:31.910 align:start position:0%
yeah jim information come on up mr
demers

06:08:31.910 --> 06:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:34.150 --> 06:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um so for the
 
06:08:36.150 --> 06:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
record my name is james demers and my
 
06:08:38.470 --> 06:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
client that has been involved in this is
 
06:08:38.480 --> 06:08:39.670 align:start position:0%
client that has been involved in this is
walmart

06:08:39.670 --> 06:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
walmart
 
06:08:41.110 --> 06:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:08:43.030 --> 06:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
i think what you're referencing is the
 
06:08:46.230 --> 06:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
commerce clause which
 
06:08:50.548 --> 06:08:50.558 align:start position:0%
does impede states ability to prevent
 
06:08:52.948 --> 06:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
out-of-state businesses like banks from
 
06:08:55.030 --> 06:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
doing certain things in new hampshire
 
06:08:58.070 --> 06:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
but it does not impede
 
06:09:00.628 --> 06:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
our consumer protection act
 
06:09:02.948 --> 06:09:02.958 align:start position:0%
and in fact our attorney general could
 
06:09:05.350 --> 06:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
go after
 
06:09:08.788 --> 06:09:08.798 align:start position:0%
one of these platforms if it's located
 
06:09:11.910 --> 06:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
out of state so they do have the ability
 
06:09:14.868 --> 06:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
to cross jurisdictions in order to take
 
06:09:17.030 --> 06:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
action because the transaction occurred
 
06:09:19.030 --> 06:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
with a new hampshire resident
 
06:09:20.868 --> 06:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
being a party to it
 
06:09:24.150 --> 06:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
but i do recall also
 
06:09:26.948 --> 06:09:26.958 align:start position:0%
during the house commerce hearing
 
06:09:29.590 --> 06:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
the attorney general saying that
 
06:09:32.708 --> 06:09:32.718 align:start position:0%
at least two of the biggest platforms
 
06:09:35.510 --> 06:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
do have a new hampshire nexus so walmart
 
06:09:37.510 --> 06:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
has brick and mortar stores in new
 
06:09:37.520 --> 06:09:38.470 align:start position:0%
has brick and mortar stores in new
hampshire

06:09:38.470 --> 06:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:09:41.670 --> 06:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
and amazon has warehouse facilities in
 
06:09:42.868 --> 06:09:42.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:09:45.030 --> 06:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
which would give him even additional
 
06:09:45.040 --> 06:09:46.470 align:start position:0%
which would give him even additional
jurisdiction

06:09:46.470 --> 06:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
06:09:50.628 --> 06:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:53.510 --> 06:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
06:09:56.868 --> 06:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
yes representative edwards
 
06:09:58.390 --> 06:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh this is for the senator if you'll
 
06:10:01.270 --> 06:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
take my question um so so i have
 
06:10:03.990 --> 06:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
constituents that would say to me
 
06:10:05.670 --> 06:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:10:08.150 --> 06:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
if we want small limited government we
 
06:10:10.868 --> 06:10:10.878 align:start position:0%
should not be growing government
 
06:10:12.868 --> 06:10:12.878 align:start position:0%
we should not be having increasing a
 
06:10:14.628 --> 06:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
regulatory environment for our
 
06:10:14.638 --> 06:10:15.830 align:start position:0%
regulatory environment for our
businesses

06:10:15.830 --> 06:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
06:10:18.948 --> 06:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
and that this bill would be inflationary
 
06:10:20.868 --> 06:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
how would you respond to those three
 
06:10:20.878 --> 06:10:21.910 align:start position:0%
how would you respond to those three
concerns

06:10:21.910 --> 06:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
06:10:23.350 --> 06:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
well first of all it doesn't grow
 
06:10:25.510 --> 06:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
government because the ag is capable of
 
06:10:27.830 --> 06:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
handling the the situation that has as
 
06:10:28.788 --> 06:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
it is
 
06:10:28.798 --> 06:10:29.910 align:start position:0%
it is
um

06:10:29.910 --> 06:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:32.788 --> 06:10:32.798 align:start position:0%
we have many um
 
06:10:35.990 --> 06:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
commerce protect our um
 
06:10:38.230 --> 06:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
consumer protection laws
 
06:10:40.548 --> 06:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
and why would this be any different we
 
06:10:42.230 --> 06:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
have people that are being harmed we
 
06:10:43.990 --> 06:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
have businesses and and forget the
 
06:10:46.788 --> 06:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
people the customers who buy off of
 
06:10:49.590 --> 06:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
these online marketing what about the
 
06:10:52.548 --> 06:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
businesses i mean we have um home depot
 
06:10:52.558 --> 06:10:53.670 align:start position:0%
businesses i mean we have um home depot
in

06:10:53.670 --> 06:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:10:56.230 --> 06:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
nashua just lost a million dollars in
 
06:10:59.030 --> 06:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
smashing grabs and stealing many of
 
06:11:00.548 --> 06:11:00.558 align:start position:0%
these products are going to be caught
 
06:11:03.510 --> 06:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
are online so in essence we're already
 
06:11:05.510 --> 06:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
paying for this
 
06:11:07.670 --> 06:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
this is a way to protect both our
 
06:11:14.948 --> 06:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:16.628 --> 06:11:16.638 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the senator
 
06:11:18.548 --> 06:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
about this yes uh representative
 
06:11:18.558 --> 06:11:20.150 align:start position:0%
about this yes uh representative
turcotte

06:11:20.150 --> 06:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
turcotte
 
06:11:22.548 --> 06:11:22.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh just looking at
 
06:11:25.030 --> 06:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
the sheet of paper that was
 
06:11:27.430 --> 06:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
handed out and also according to the
 
06:11:28.868 --> 06:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
senator's last
 
06:11:31.750 --> 06:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
statement talking about smash and grabs
 
06:11:33.990 --> 06:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
06:11:37.110 --> 06:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
the organized real tale crime at least
 
06:11:39.830 --> 06:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire the majority of these
 
06:11:39.840 --> 06:11:40.948 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire the majority of these
are

06:11:40.948 --> 06:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:11:40.958 --> 06:11:42.830 align:start position:0%
are
thefts

06:11:42.830 --> 06:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
thefts
 
06:11:45.750 --> 06:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
from brick and mortar whether or not
 
06:11:48.390 --> 06:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
that stuff ends up online
 
06:11:50.948 --> 06:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
during my discussions kind of irrelevant
 
06:11:52.390 --> 06:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
the point i mean
 
06:11:54.548 --> 06:11:54.558 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna make is if these are smashing
 
06:11:56.788 --> 06:11:56.798 align:start position:0%
grabs or if there's just a ring of going
 
06:12:00.150 --> 06:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
into these stores home depot whatever
 
06:12:02.070 --> 06:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
is that not
 
06:12:02.080 --> 06:12:03.510 align:start position:0%
is that not
a

06:12:03.510 --> 06:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:12:05.830 --> 06:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
an issue for stos
 
06:12:09.590 --> 06:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me store security and
 
06:12:09.600 --> 06:12:10.830 align:start position:0%
excuse me store security and
theft

06:12:10.830 --> 06:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
theft
 
06:12:13.990 --> 06:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
prevention i mean all these here look to
 
06:12:16.150 --> 06:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
be in that category at least in new
 
06:12:16.160 --> 06:12:17.430 align:start position:0%
be in that category at least in new
hampshire

06:12:17.430 --> 06:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:12:17.440 --> 06:12:18.470 align:start position:0%
hampshire
so

06:12:18.470 --> 06:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:12:21.510 --> 06:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not so sure my my mind has been
 
06:12:23.270 --> 06:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
changed that
 
06:12:25.750 --> 06:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
this is probably not something that we
 
06:12:25.760 --> 06:12:26.390 align:start position:0%
this is probably not something that we
need

06:12:26.390 --> 06:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
need
 
06:12:29.190 --> 06:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:29.200 --> 06:12:30.548 align:start position:0%
 
well

06:12:30.548 --> 06:12:30.558 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:12:32.868 --> 06:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
if you don't think some of these things
 
06:12:36.310 --> 06:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
that i mean we do have i just stated
 
06:12:37.670 --> 06:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
that the
 
06:12:37.680 --> 06:12:39.190 align:start position:0%
that the
um

06:12:39.190 --> 06:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:43.590 --> 06:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
that in manchester in um 2019 400 pieces
 
06:12:46.470 --> 06:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
of new box products including tools and
 
06:12:46.480 --> 06:12:47.750 align:start position:0%
of new box products including tools and
electronics

06:12:47.750 --> 06:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
electronics
 
06:12:49.590 --> 06:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
were reportedly stolen several of the
 
06:12:51.350 --> 06:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
criminals involved in the organized
 
06:12:53.590 --> 06:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
retail crime scheme would sell the
 
06:12:55.910 --> 06:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
stolen products online for profit if you
 
06:12:57.750 --> 06:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
don't think that
 
06:12:57.760 --> 06:12:58.868 align:start position:0%
don't think that
um

06:12:58.868 --> 06:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:02.150 --> 06:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
cri the organized retail crime is not
 
06:13:04.868 --> 06:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
being sold online then i've got a bridge
 
06:13:08.150 --> 06:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:09.910 --> 06:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't disagree that some of that
 
06:13:09.920 --> 06:13:10.948 align:start position:0%
and i don't disagree that some of that
stuff

06:13:10.948 --> 06:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
06:13:12.948 --> 06:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
ends up online what i am saying is going
 
06:13:15.110 --> 06:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
back to my original point
 
06:13:17.750 --> 06:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
why were 400 pieces of new box products
 
06:13:21.350 --> 06:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
including tools and electronics allowed
 
06:13:23.190 --> 06:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
to be stolen
 
06:13:26.310 --> 06:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
from uh from a store where's the
 
06:13:27.830 --> 06:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know where's the store security
 
06:13:29.830 --> 06:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
where's uh the involvement with the
 
06:13:31.750 --> 06:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
police there's another one here
 
06:13:33.910 --> 06:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
talking about the perfume in nashua
 
06:13:35.910 --> 06:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
where the retail crime manager
 
06:13:37.590 --> 06:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
recognized one of the three caught on
 
06:13:40.070 --> 06:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
footage noting he's an extensive history
 
06:13:41.510 --> 06:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
of theft i mean
 
06:13:41.520 --> 06:13:42.708 align:start position:0%
of theft i mean
um

06:13:42.708 --> 06:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:44.230 --> 06:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
so you're blaming the victim at this
 
06:13:44.240 --> 06:13:45.110 align:start position:0%
so you're blaming the victim at this
point

06:13:45.110 --> 06:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
point
 
06:13:47.510 --> 06:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
i'm blaming the
 
06:13:50.868 --> 06:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
the stores who are
 
06:13:52.708 --> 06:13:52.718 align:start position:0%
having their
 
06:13:58.390 --> 06:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:59.750 --> 06:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
putting more
 
06:14:02.548 --> 06:14:02.558 align:start position:0%
policies procedures or whatever in
 
06:14:04.548 --> 06:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
security to prevent this stuff from
 
06:14:06.310 --> 06:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
happening in the first place a lot of
 
06:14:10.470 --> 06:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
these stores are being held at gunpoint
 
06:14:13.190 --> 06:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's a 500 billion dollar
 
06:14:14.948 --> 06:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
market for this
 
06:14:16.708 --> 06:14:16.718 align:start position:0%
and many of the ones in the larger
 
06:14:19.110 --> 06:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
stores some of the employees are being
 
06:14:21.670 --> 06:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
held at gunpoint i'm not sure that any
 
06:14:23.510 --> 06:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
store security would be able to handle
 
06:14:25.590 --> 06:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
that kind of
 
06:14:25.600 --> 06:14:27.750 align:start position:0%
that kind of
assault

06:14:27.750 --> 06:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
assault
 
06:14:31.430 --> 06:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:32.788 --> 06:14:32.798 align:start position:0%
at the risk of
 
06:14:35.590 --> 06:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
of my getting myself confused what what
 
06:14:38.470 --> 06:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
i think the point of this paper is
 
06:14:39.510 --> 06:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
is to
 
06:14:41.990 --> 06:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
highlight the fact that there are
 
06:14:42.000 --> 06:14:43.190 align:start position:0%
highlight the fact that there are
thefts

06:14:43.190 --> 06:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
thefts
 
06:14:44.948 --> 06:14:44.958 align:start position:0%
taking place in new hampshire and that
 
06:14:48.390 --> 06:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
these items may well end up in an online
 
06:14:51.430 --> 06:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
transaction but what your bill does
 
06:14:52.628 --> 06:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:14:55.670 --> 06:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
it goes to the marketplace the online
 
06:14:55.680 --> 06:14:57.030 align:start position:0%
it goes to the marketplace the online
marketeer

06:14:57.030 --> 06:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
marketeer
 
06:14:59.670 --> 06:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
and holds them accountable for
 
06:15:01.990 --> 06:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
maintaining records on
 
06:15:04.548 --> 06:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
who enters their online market from a
 
06:15:06.948 --> 06:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
supplier perspective if they're of a
 
06:15:08.628 --> 06:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
sufficient size
 
06:15:10.150 --> 06:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
so so
 
06:15:12.150 --> 06:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
so this paper isn't
 
06:15:15.430 --> 06:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
directly correlated to your bill other
 
06:15:16.708 --> 06:15:16.718 align:start position:0%
than to say
 
06:15:19.190 --> 06:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
that this sort of crime exists and this
 
06:15:20.548 --> 06:15:20.558 align:start position:0%
is a way
 
06:15:24.150 --> 06:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
that the illicit suppliers get their
 
06:15:24.160 --> 06:15:25.430 align:start position:0%
that the illicit suppliers get their
inventory

06:15:25.430 --> 06:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
inventory
 
06:15:28.150 --> 06:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
that is correct all right thank you i
 
06:15:32.390 --> 06:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
saw a television clip of two carloads of
 
06:15:35.670 --> 06:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
bad guys all masked and everything
 
06:15:35.680 --> 06:15:36.948 align:start position:0%
bad guys all masked and everything
and

06:15:36.948 --> 06:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:15:36.958 --> 06:15:37.910 align:start position:0%
and
they

06:15:37.910 --> 06:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:15:39.750 --> 06:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
very quickly took out the front window
 
06:15:42.628 --> 06:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
of a high-end jewelry store and then
 
06:15:44.628 --> 06:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
crashed into all the cabinets and just
 
06:15:47.510 --> 06:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
scooped stuff up and put them in bags
 
06:15:48.868 --> 06:15:48.878 align:start position:0%
and they were gone
 
06:15:51.270 --> 06:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
in less than a minute
 
06:15:52.948 --> 06:15:52.958 align:start position:0%
now there's
 
06:15:55.030 --> 06:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
two ways to deal with this because this
 
06:15:57.510 --> 06:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
is obviously very important the
 
06:16:00.070 --> 06:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
merchant has lost merchandise his
 
06:16:02.310 --> 06:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
insurance payments will go up he's had
 
06:16:05.110 --> 06:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
his store damaged uh if he's going to
 
06:16:06.868 --> 06:16:06.878 align:start position:0%
stay in business he will have to charge
 
06:16:08.868 --> 06:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
more money out of the pockets of
 
06:16:10.470 --> 06:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
innocent consumers
 
06:16:12.708 --> 06:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
it's two ways to go after these people
 
06:16:15.030 --> 06:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
number one is at the at the level of the
 
06:16:17.190 --> 06:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
local police do we have footage do we
 
06:16:19.510 --> 06:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
have cameras taking license plates not
 
06:16:21.590 --> 06:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire but in other states do
 
06:16:23.590 --> 06:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
we have a way of going after the bad
 
06:16:26.470 --> 06:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
guys that's one way secondly
 
06:16:28.470 --> 06:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
when they try to sell the stuff online
 
06:16:30.070 --> 06:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
your bill does not deal with every
 
06:16:31.910 --> 06:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
aspect of organized crime but it deals
 
06:16:33.910 --> 06:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
with one important thing that's been
 
06:16:36.470 --> 06:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
somewhat neglected in my opinion
 
06:16:39.910 --> 06:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i might add to that um
 
06:16:42.548 --> 06:16:42.558 align:start position:0%
in years past they have found that i
 
06:16:44.390 --> 06:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
think in one of the articles i read they
 
06:16:47.510 --> 06:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
have found that um pawn brokers in in
 
06:16:49.510 --> 06:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
the past used to they used to do the
 
06:16:51.830 --> 06:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
same thing with pawn brokers they have
 
06:16:54.390 --> 06:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
come down and they have put rules and
 
06:16:58.310 --> 06:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
regulations in with pawn brokers to
 
06:17:02.150 --> 06:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
i won't say eliminate but help
 
06:17:04.708 --> 06:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
help eliminate some of the issues this
 
06:17:07.670 --> 06:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
is similar to what they're doing to try
 
06:17:07.680 --> 06:17:08.548 align:start position:0%
is similar to what they're doing to try
and

06:17:08.548 --> 06:17:08.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:17:11.110 --> 06:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
stop ahead of time any people that would
 
06:17:13.270 --> 06:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
be going um doing these smash and grabs
 
06:17:17.990 --> 06:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:21.110 --> 06:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
06:17:22.868 --> 06:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman would this
 
06:17:26.548 --> 06:17:26.558 align:start position:0%
apply uh senator to
 
06:17:30.868 --> 06:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
things like craigslist facebook
 
06:17:34.708 --> 06:17:34.718 align:start position:0%
or is this strictly an amazon related
 
06:17:37.590 --> 06:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
big major online marketplaces my
 
06:17:39.270 --> 06:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is craigslist is not
 
06:17:40.788 --> 06:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
included in this
 
06:17:42.230 --> 06:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
the chair would like to recognize to
 
06:17:44.150 --> 06:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
speak curtis barry who is a subject
 
06:17:46.150 --> 06:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
matter expert on this to answer that
 
06:17:46.160 --> 06:17:48.390 align:start position:0%
matter expert on this to answer that
question

06:17:48.390 --> 06:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:17:52.548 --> 06:17:52.558 align:start position:0%
i can recognize you behind your mask
 
06:17:54.868 --> 06:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
the orange badge was a giveaway
 
06:17:55.910 --> 06:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i think you're
 
06:17:58.230 --> 06:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
building too high of expectations for me
 
06:17:59.830 --> 06:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
but um
 
06:18:01.750 --> 06:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
to answer that question directly in the
 
06:18:04.470 --> 06:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
bill in the language uh there are two
 
06:18:06.628 --> 06:18:06.638 align:start position:0%
definitions if you will two thresholds
 
06:18:08.548 --> 06:18:08.558 align:start position:0%
one for the online marketplace one for
 
06:18:08.558 --> 06:18:09.270 align:start position:0%
one for the online marketplace one for
the

06:18:09.270 --> 06:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:18:12.070 --> 06:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
the seller i think as already recognized
 
06:18:14.708 --> 06:18:14.718 align:start position:0%
the seller needs to have sold
 
06:18:18.150 --> 06:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh made 200 or more transactions and
 
06:18:20.470 --> 06:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
word and not or and five thousand
 
06:18:22.390 --> 06:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of transactions in a
 
06:18:25.270 --> 06:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
12-month period to fall under the bill
 
06:18:28.230 --> 06:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
on the marketplace
 
06:18:30.628 --> 06:18:30.638 align:start position:0%
in essence it it only applies to
 
06:18:32.390 --> 06:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
marketplaces that facilitate the
 
06:18:34.390 --> 06:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
financial transaction
 
06:18:36.788 --> 06:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
so as i've explained
 
06:18:38.868 --> 06:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
to folks on this bill before
 
06:18:41.430 --> 06:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
if i'm selling on craigslist and i sell
 
06:18:43.590 --> 06:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
my basketball hoop to representative
 
06:18:43.600 --> 06:18:44.548 align:start position:0%
my basketball hoop to representative
edwards

06:18:44.548 --> 06:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
edwards
 
06:18:46.150 --> 06:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh he's going to come to my home with
 
06:18:47.830 --> 06:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
his pickup truck we're going to exchange
 
06:18:47.840 --> 06:18:49.270 align:start position:0%
his pickup truck we're going to exchange
cash

06:18:49.270 --> 06:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
cash
 
06:18:51.030 --> 06:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
the marketplace does not facilitate the
 
06:18:52.788 --> 06:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
transaction in that place so craigslist
 
06:18:54.948 --> 06:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
is out what's in is where the
 
06:18:56.708 --> 06:18:56.718 align:start position:0%
marketplace does facilitate that
 
06:18:59.910 --> 06:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:59.920 --> 06:19:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:19:01.830 --> 06:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:19:06.788 --> 06:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:06.798 --> 06:19:07.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:19:07.670 --> 06:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:19:10.390 --> 06:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
so i think you used an and statement
 
06:19:13.670 --> 06:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
that it's 200 transactions and
 
06:19:15.030 --> 06:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
5 000
 
06:19:17.670 --> 06:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
within 12 months correct
 
06:19:21.430 --> 06:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
that that that doesn't feel like
 
06:19:24.310 --> 06:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
that seems slow to me like why is why
 
06:19:26.548 --> 06:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
aren't we talking a thousand
 
06:19:29.670 --> 06:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand why it seems like maybe
 
06:19:32.310 --> 06:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
we've got a bigger net here than what's
 
06:19:34.708 --> 06:19:34.718 align:start position:0%
needed how did those two numbers get
 
06:19:36.310 --> 06:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
picked for the
 
06:19:38.390 --> 06:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
size of the supplier so representative
 
06:19:41.270 --> 06:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
edwards that decision those
 
06:19:43.110 --> 06:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
decisions on the terminology or the
 
06:19:44.948 --> 06:19:44.958 align:start position:0%
language in this particular bill were
 
06:19:47.190 --> 06:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
decided well above me and well outside
 
06:19:48.468 --> 06:19:48.478 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
06:19:50.628 --> 06:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
around the time of the senate hearing
 
06:19:53.030 --> 06:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
this year on this bill in fact in a
 
06:19:54.948 --> 06:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
matter of a week or so
 
06:19:56.868 --> 06:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
there was agreement among parties
 
06:19:59.190 --> 06:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
relative to the federal language and as
 
06:20:01.590 --> 06:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
senator birdsell referenced earlier this
 
06:20:03.830 --> 06:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
language what you have before you
 
06:20:06.468 --> 06:20:06.478 align:start position:0%
mirrors what's um what was agreed upon
 
06:20:09.030 --> 06:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
in federal language so i can't speak to
 
06:20:11.350 --> 06:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
the wise wherefores of those numbers
 
06:20:12.868 --> 06:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
other than to say
 
06:20:16.150 --> 06:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
it wanted to recognize folks that are
 
06:20:19.350 --> 06:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
high volume sellers without getting
 
06:20:21.590 --> 06:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
too ridiculously high to capture you
 
06:20:23.590 --> 06:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
know virtually no one
 
06:20:25.190 --> 06:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:20:27.350 --> 06:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
the language would be pretty much the
 
06:20:30.948 --> 06:20:30.958 align:start position:0%
same in this wonderful map i have here
 
06:20:32.390 --> 06:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
some of which
 
06:20:34.468 --> 06:20:34.478 align:start position:0%
are states that have already it's in law
 
06:20:36.628 --> 06:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
now there are six states where this is
 
06:20:39.750 --> 06:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
enacted of five of those uh are this
 
06:20:42.150 --> 06:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
calendar year i believe uh and the
 
06:20:43.750 --> 06:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
balance of those that has passed at
 
06:20:45.670 --> 06:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
least one legislative body yes and the
 
06:20:47.750 --> 06:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
language is consistent with what we have
 
06:20:47.760 --> 06:20:48.708 align:start position:0%
language is consistent with what we have
here

06:20:48.708 --> 06:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:20:51.190 --> 06:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you
 
06:20:53.510 --> 06:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:20:56.150 --> 06:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
i'd like to do a sense of the room on
 
06:20:59.030 --> 06:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
this point only um
 
06:20:59.040 --> 06:21:02.788 align:start position:0%
this point only um
senate

06:21:02.788 --> 06:21:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:04.548 --> 06:21:04.558 align:start position:0%
this is just a straw poll it isn't
 
06:21:06.868 --> 06:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
locking us into anything
 
06:21:09.270 --> 06:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
i'm supporting it
 
06:21:11.750 --> 06:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
so you like it because you sent it to us
 
06:21:14.708 --> 06:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
right good thank you
 
06:21:19.350 --> 06:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:20.468 --> 06:21:20.478 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
06:21:24.310 --> 06:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
i think we did this yesterday i think um
 
06:21:27.670 --> 06:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
we did here here's my points um
 
06:21:29.430 --> 06:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
while i don't disagree there there are
 
06:21:32.468 --> 06:21:32.478 align:start position:0%
issues out there um this came out of
 
06:21:34.310 --> 06:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
commerce with an interim study i have
 
06:21:37.510 --> 06:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
great faith in representative hunt
 
06:21:39.910 --> 06:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
we listened to a very
 
06:21:42.948 --> 06:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh rambunctious discussion yesterday
 
06:21:46.468 --> 06:21:46.478 align:start position:0%
during the uh
 
06:21:47.830 --> 06:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
small break
 
06:21:47.840 --> 06:21:49.030 align:start position:0%
small break
um

06:21:49.030 --> 06:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:49.040 --> 06:21:53.430 align:start position:0%
um
and

06:21:53.430 --> 06:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:57.110 --> 06:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
i just think that there's the federal uh
 
06:21:58.628 --> 06:21:58.638 align:start position:0%
potential out there
 
06:21:59.910 --> 06:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
again i'm
 
06:22:03.270 --> 06:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
not being an expert in this um and not
 
06:22:04.788 --> 06:22:04.798 align:start position:0%
on this committee for this particular
 
06:22:06.628 --> 06:22:06.638 align:start position:0%
piece i i have to rely on representative
 
06:22:09.350 --> 06:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
hunt i know he is certainly still
 
06:22:12.150 --> 06:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh for the interim study part of this
 
06:22:12.160 --> 06:22:13.190 align:start position:0%
uh for the interim study part of this
um

06:22:13.190 --> 06:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:16.310 --> 06:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
so at this point i'm i still know on it
 
06:22:17.590 --> 06:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:22:20.548 --> 06:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
can i just add something please do so
 
06:22:23.590 --> 06:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
and i i understand the concern and that
 
06:22:25.110 --> 06:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
it goes into
 
06:22:27.750 --> 06:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
that the fed the feds however if we're
 
06:22:29.270 --> 06:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
going to wait for the feds to do
 
06:22:31.110 --> 06:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
something to help our constituents and
 
06:22:32.788 --> 06:22:32.798 align:start position:0%
our businesses
 
06:22:36.788 --> 06:22:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:38.230 --> 06:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
senator i
 
06:22:40.150 --> 06:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
seem to recall please help me if i
 
06:22:42.548 --> 06:22:42.558 align:start position:0%
recall accurately
 
06:22:43.910 --> 06:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
that if
 
06:22:45.030 --> 06:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
the feds
 
06:22:48.070 --> 06:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
get around to passing this kind of bill
 
06:22:50.230 --> 06:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
it will a be
 
06:22:52.548 --> 06:22:52.558 align:start position:0%
for the whole country of course
 
06:22:54.788 --> 06:22:54.798 align:start position:0%
and b anything that we do here will
 
06:22:56.948 --> 06:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
quickly sunset
 
06:22:59.990 --> 06:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
so if they're going to move quickly
 
06:23:02.628 --> 06:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
wonderful it'll sunset soon
 
06:23:04.150 --> 06:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
if they're not
 
06:23:06.070 --> 06:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
may we not need this
 
06:23:07.670 --> 06:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
if they're just not going to get off the
 
06:23:07.680 --> 06:23:09.430 align:start position:0%
if they're just not going to get off the
dime

06:23:09.430 --> 06:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
dime
 
06:23:09.440 --> 06:23:11.190 align:start position:0%
dime
okay

06:23:11.190 --> 06:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:23:11.200 --> 06:23:14.548 align:start position:0%
okay
so

06:23:14.548 --> 06:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:15.830 --> 06:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
06:23:18.548 --> 06:23:18.558 align:start position:0%
uh we do not have unanimity
 
06:23:24.468 --> 06:23:24.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:26.070 --> 06:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
i would love to know what you think i
 
06:23:28.548 --> 06:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
always love to know what you think
 
06:23:31.190 --> 06:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
i i have no passion for this bill it
 
06:23:32.868 --> 06:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
sounds like a
 
06:23:35.190 --> 06:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
a reasonable effort to uh protect
 
06:23:37.110 --> 06:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
consumers um
 
06:23:38.948 --> 06:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
06:23:42.628 --> 06:23:42.638 align:start position:0%
if if if the cost of getting my dhhs
 
06:23:44.390 --> 06:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
privacy bill
 
06:23:46.948 --> 06:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
passed uh is this
 
06:23:49.990 --> 06:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
component of the agreement i i'm i'm in
 
06:23:53.270 --> 06:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
favor of it otherwise i'm like i have no
 
06:23:56.548 --> 06:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
independent passion for it
 
06:23:59.110 --> 06:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
okay it's hard to sustain the passion on
 
06:24:04.948 --> 06:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:07.430 --> 06:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
now i need to ask this question that i
 
06:24:09.910 --> 06:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
asked yesterday that now that we've had
 
06:24:11.910 --> 06:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
time to think it through
 
06:24:13.830 --> 06:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
is the senate's position
 
06:24:16.628 --> 06:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
on this bill with its four parts
 
06:24:18.390 --> 06:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
all or nothing or are you willing to
 
06:24:23.350 --> 06:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:25.030 --> 06:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the uh thank you for the
 
06:24:26.948 --> 06:24:26.958 align:start position:0%
question mr chair it's
 
06:24:29.190 --> 06:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
these are all bills that
 
06:24:30.788 --> 06:24:30.798 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
06:24:33.990 --> 06:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
attached to this house bill
 
06:24:36.070 --> 06:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
we would like to see them i think we've
 
06:24:36.080 --> 06:24:37.270 align:start position:0%
we would like to see them i think we've
made

06:24:37.270 --> 06:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
made
 
06:24:39.750 --> 06:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
great arguments as to why they should
 
06:24:39.760 --> 06:24:41.270 align:start position:0%
great arguments as to why they should
pass

06:24:41.270 --> 06:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
pass
 
06:24:42.548 --> 06:24:42.558 align:start position:0%
we're not going to vote on these
 
06:24:46.070 --> 06:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
individually we will vote on them as one
 
06:24:48.070 --> 06:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
all or nothing all or nothing okay
 
06:24:50.788 --> 06:24:50.798 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
06:24:53.750 --> 06:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
um given given that that's the case uh
 
06:24:57.350 --> 06:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
i'm a no uh because i this uh
 
06:24:59.990 --> 06:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
the 5 million for the homeless
 
06:25:03.670 --> 06:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
project uh i i just can't support it
 
06:25:06.548 --> 06:25:06.558 align:start position:0%
it was a bill that the senate passed and
 
06:25:09.750 --> 06:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
tabled and didn't send the house for the
 
06:25:13.510 --> 06:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
house to have its due process around hhs
 
06:25:16.468 --> 06:25:16.478 align:start position:0%
committee and division three
 
06:25:18.948 --> 06:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
we're in the middle of a budget year
 
06:25:20.788 --> 06:25:20.798 align:start position:0%
the governor's about to start his budget
 
06:25:22.948 --> 06:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
year in a few months
 
06:25:25.110 --> 06:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
and this is a good candidate for that
 
06:25:26.230 --> 06:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
but if
 
06:25:29.110 --> 06:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of getting my privacy bill
 
06:25:32.310 --> 06:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
passed is the 5 million for the homeless
 
06:25:35.910 --> 06:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
then i would rather have neither
 
06:25:38.150 --> 06:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm seeing
 
06:25:39.990 --> 06:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
pretty much know
 
06:25:42.150 --> 06:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
and representative turcotte thank you mr
 
06:25:45.750 --> 06:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um yeah as a whole no
 
06:25:47.750 --> 06:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative edwards made
 
06:25:49.590 --> 06:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
the exact point i would make on that
 
06:25:51.430 --> 06:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
particular piece of the bill
 
06:25:51.440 --> 06:25:52.390 align:start position:0%
particular piece of the bill
um

06:25:52.390 --> 06:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:54.948 --> 06:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
and the other part that i discussed in
 
06:25:59.830 --> 06:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
detail yet uh yesterday was the uh
 
06:26:03.350 --> 06:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
the pay cards which i think i
 
06:26:04.548 --> 06:26:04.558 align:start position:0%
made the
 
06:26:07.430 --> 06:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
promise to the senators that i believe
 
06:26:09.510 --> 06:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
we should work together next fall to
 
06:26:11.190 --> 06:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
come up with something
 
06:26:13.590 --> 06:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's much more business friendly and
 
06:26:15.430 --> 06:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
much more easier
 
06:26:18.628 --> 06:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
and less regulation so i don't believe
 
06:26:20.230 --> 06:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
that should remain in there either and
 
06:26:21.830 --> 06:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
then we've just spoken about the last
 
06:26:24.948 --> 06:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
part so no i would be you know
 
06:26:26.468 --> 06:26:26.478 align:start position:0%
so it looks like our conclusion then
 
06:26:31.110 --> 06:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:33.590 --> 06:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
06:27:11.910 --> 06:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:11.920 --> 06:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
you
