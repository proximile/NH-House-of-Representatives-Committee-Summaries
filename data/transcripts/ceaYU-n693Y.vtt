00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
confines
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
um believe it or
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
not believe it or not this is what we
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
were all used to and it felt kind of
 
00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
strange to have to holler across the
 
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
room um
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
it may seem tight but you'll get used to
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
it the only problem with this room and
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's not a problem yet but it may be um
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
is the noise Factor this is a this is a
 
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
slight removable wall it doesn't block
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
the noise so if there's a hearing on the
 
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
other side it's it does get loud in
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
these these narrow rooms but we should
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
be uh we should be good today Mr chair
 
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 align:start position:0%

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
vice chair in the last hearing that we
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
were all together um I did watch the
 
00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:51.879 align:start position:0%
hearings um on YouTube a couple of times
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
job so I appreciate your help um Madam
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
Vice chair um it won't won't be the last
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
time that I uh that I bail and let
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh um our work go and capable hands um
 
00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
so thank you there uh secondly as far as
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
our work schedule on the exact session
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
today um I think what we're just so
 
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
everyone is um up to dat with where it's
 
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
going we have received some last minute
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
information on one of the bills um House
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 6 1866 we received and I think
 
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
everyone has received by email um an
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to that bill um rather
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
than processing uh through the exec
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
session I think what would be best is if
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
we uh put that exec session on that bill
 
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
off until the
 
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
31st um it appears like we are still
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
have time to be able to get it in the
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
calendar so um on the 30 1st you can you
 
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
will see that house bill 1666 will be
 
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
EXA on that day um and there was no
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
times listed so we're just going to uh I
 
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
think we've lumped them all together at
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
one o00 um so I think uh we'll we'll
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
it'll be in that batch somewhere along
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
the line I'm getting puzzle looks from a
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
couple people but uh we we should be
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
good for this for the 31st for 1666
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
great um that means we have this morning
 
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
uh 5 1 2 three four five bills to exec
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
um and then we have hearings this
 
00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:46.030 align:start position:0%
um and then we have hearings this
afternoon

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
00:09:51.069 --> 00:09:51.079 align:start position:0%
um and I've done it this way but I'm not
 
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
sure I'm going to continue to do it this
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
way with the exact session in the
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
morning and um and the hearings in the
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
the afternoon I think I think but I'm
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
open to suggestions from the committee I
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
think it works better if we do the
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
reverse if we have the hearings in the
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
morning and the exec session in the
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon it may not matter to anyone
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
else um I did it this
 
00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:19.959 align:start position:0%
way this time because if you recall
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
there was some confusion over whether we
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
would be having a hearing uh I'm sorry a
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
house session today um
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
and I quickly put it in here thinking
 
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
that people would have already had this
 
00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
day circled on their calendar and so it
 
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
would be a a great opportunity for us to
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh um probably have uh full attendance
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
of our committee as it happens it didn't
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
work because we have two um helpers
 
00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:52.519 align:start position:0%
today two substitutes uh thank you very
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
much for attending and for helping us uh
 
00:10:59.069 --> 00:10:59.079 align:start position:0%
with our work um rep ger Mana is that
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
how it's pronounced and rep PRI um so
 
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for uh for helping
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
us um but from from now on I'm going to
 
00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
try to do everything I can um to do the
 
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
reverse and have the exact session in
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
the afternoon and hearings in the
 
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
morning we do want to uh try to get rid
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
of or not rid of bad choice of words we
 
00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
do have um we do want to try to um
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
do do diligence on all of our bills um
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
as quickly as we can there the speaker
 
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
has already suggested that we plan to
 
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:44.839 align:start position:0%
have at least three sessions in um in
 
00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:47.079 align:start position:0%
February hopefully we're not going to
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
have a session the last week of February
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
um which is also school vacation week
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
which is always kind of nice um but I
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
want people to understand that we have a
 
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
record number of bills for uh for the
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
second year of the session and and the
 
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
goal for me is to not have at crossover
 
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
an inordinate number of bills that we
 
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
have to go through so the quicker we can
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
get through our work here the quicker we
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
can handle those in February and the
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
quicker we don't have to worry about um
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
maybe meeting till 1 or two in the
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
morning um before crossover so that's my
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
goal um any anyone that has suggestions
 
00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:35.959 align:start position:0%
on how we can accomplish that more
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
efficiently I'm I have two ears and I'm
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
happy to listen um great with that uh I
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
think I will open the exact session
 
00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1096 and uh recognize
 
00:12:52.199 --> 00:12:53.670 align:start position:0%

very briefly Mr chairman uh we had
 
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
testimony uh from the prime sponsor that
 
00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
he would prefer to have state songs
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
available through the visitor center uh
 
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
we had testimony from the director of
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
The Visitor Center Virginia Drew who
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
said we had tried that once before it
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't highly successful at all we have
 
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
lots of merchandise at the state visitor
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
center which um is constantly being
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
purchased and all and the perception at
 
00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:00.759 align:start position:0%
the State House is that if you buy
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
something from the State House Visitor
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
Center it's sanctioned by the state and
 
00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:08.839 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily mean that if
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
there's a state song that the state has
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
approved of that and I would like to
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
hear from representative mcarter because
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
I think she has some really good
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%

representative wall um I just think what
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
when an artist or wh whomever uh would
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
utilize the state symbol which is
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
trademarked it gives a public perception
 
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
of whatever it is being sanctioned by uh
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire it could be a
 
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
song it could be a piece of artw workk
 
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
it could be a flag it could be you know
 
00:14:58.749 --> 00:14:58.759 align:start position:0%
anything if it portrays the state symbol
 
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
it gives a subliminal um uh message to
 
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
the general public that this is
 
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
something the state of New Hampshire is
 
00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:08.759 align:start position:0%
supporting or encourages or what have
 
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
you um and and I just think that you
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
know that there's a lot of controversial
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
stuff out there that where this could go
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
could be certainly a lot of benign
 
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
things but I just really don't think
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
that it's a necessary um area for for
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
this to that we need legislation for
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
this I I I would vote itl on this as
 
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.389 align:start position:0%
this I I I would vote itl on this as
well

00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%

00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
the only thing I want to add to that and
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much um is that the
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
state seal can only be applied to
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
anything by the secretary of state so we
 
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
have to be very careful with that so
 
00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
that we don't put the state seal on
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
things that should not have it thank you
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
hold the exec session
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
um yes I'd like to move consent um

calendar on that without objection
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%

is W thank you very much Mr chairman
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
also um a practice we've had for some of
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
the members who aren't new here um it's
 
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
always helpful if we have a Republican
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
or Democrat who which party makes the
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
motion because we so often agree when we
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
come to terms on things it's nice to
 
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
have one party make the motion the other
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
party second it it it it's just a nice
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%

this bill HB 1309 requires that the
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State publish uh the
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
location of all enrolled bills and
 
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
resolutions on its public website this
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
uh will serve to facilitate more
 
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
transparency with uh and streamline the
 
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
process with regards to identifying
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
where the bills are um in the pipeline
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
and the movement throughout uh the
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
legislative process uh as was testified
 
00:20:48.909 --> 00:20:48.919 align:start position:0%
uh to by the house clerk the creation of
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
um such an online portal will reduce
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
weight times and uh increase
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
accountability and also minimize staff
 
00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559 align:start position:0%
resources when inquiries are osed um
 
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
relative to the status of pending
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
legislation so I um would concur with
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
the house Clerk's testimony that this
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
should this ought to pass thank you
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very good off the top of your
 
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.390 align:start position:0%
thank you very good off the top of your
head

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
head
 
00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:17.559 align:start position:0%
um representative wall did you very much
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you very much um yes
 
00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
um the chairman of this committee has to
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
sign the bills just before they go to
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
the governor's office so again when if a
 
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
bill comes through here passes the house
 
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
goes to the Senate hearings passes the
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
Senate where does it go nobody knows and
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
for months a bill can be held up
 
00:21:42.029 --> 00:21:42.039 align:start position:0%
somewhere out there and it's been really
 
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
confusing and especially when the
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
chairman of this committee is called to
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
sign bills where are the Bills and
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
there'll often be a stack of them but
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
nobody knows where they've been in the
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
meantime and it's really awkward if if
 
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
someone's coming in for a public signing
 
00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:57.559 align:start position:0%
of a bill they they don't know when that
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
can Poss possibly happen because
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
governor's office can't say where it is
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
Chairman of this committee can't say
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
where it is no one knows where it is so
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to help clarify
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
things for the general public it's going
 
00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:11.559 align:start position:0%
to make this process cleaner simpler
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
more understandable for everybody thank
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative wall I want
 
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
to be clear she's not meaning the
 
00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:22.039 align:start position:0%
chairman of this committee has to uh
 
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
sign off on these bills um I am serving
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
on enrolled bills committee but um but
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't come through this committee
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
is what I was being clear no it doesn't
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
but the as chairman I had to go into the
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office and sign
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
they always ask us whoever chairs to
 
00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
sign those bills whether they're
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
enrolled bills or not they when the
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
final process is legislative
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
administration's in their signing at
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
least that's what they did to me thank
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
you I think you I think you were special
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
um at uh at any rate I will say um
 
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
quickly that uh the
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
problem um this is a solution that to a
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
problem that's been ongoing for years um
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
that uh it's very difficult with so many
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
parties um involved um it's been very
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
difficult for at anyone moment in time
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
to point to the point the finger to the
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
correct party that has the bill um and
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
this will help the public I'm certain if
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh to be able to know at least where the
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
bill exists in the timeline and um and
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that um maybe there be
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
pressure put to Bear to get them in a
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
timely fashion signed and and into law
 
00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a wonderful idea um any
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
other further
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%

67 um and the chair would recognize ah
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
the chair would recognize uh
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative mcarter for a motion
 
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I motion uh in
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
itl uh rep mcarter moves itl uh is there
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
a second seconded by uh representative
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
ning Wong uh representative mcarter
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion I
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
would thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
um hb1
 
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
1367 was a bill uh presented to Grant
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
immunity to people test in in public
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
hearing um for things that may otherwise
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
incriminate them in some sort of a
 
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
criminal activity I would guess um
 
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
however questions are still out there
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
that weren't answered as to whether or
 
00:26:46.029 --> 00:26:46.039 align:start position:0%
not legislators have the authority to
 
00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:47.799 align:start position:0%
Grant such immunity and I think those
 
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
questions are still out there um and for
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
that reason I think this is at this time
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate thank you
 
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
representative mcarter um
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
I forget oh representative nutting Wong
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
you seconded would you like to sure um I
 
00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:06.919 align:start position:0%
think that it is a I think it's really
 
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned but the bill itself
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
just isn't uh ready or um doesn't have
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
like quite the right wording for it
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
discussion I will just say um one
 
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
briefly that um there are a number of um
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions with this um the
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
biggest one for me is I'm not sure who
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
would look at any type of um um get out
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
of jail free card from um the chair or
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
any other member of um a legislative
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
committee as being anything that they
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
could use um aside from in Monopoly um
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
with any Court in in the land um I I I'm
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
not sure how that would would work um so
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
with that I agree with the I
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
motion with that I'll ask the clerk call
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%

motion I mean this uh flag uh in
 
00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:12.039 align:start position:0%
addition to that it opens a Pandora's
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
Box if we approve one flag to be hung
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
over the state house then everybody else
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
can come in and say you did it for this
 
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
one why can't we have the same thing and
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
we will have flag from everything under
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
the sun trying to be flown over the
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
state house and that's the reason for
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
the itl
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
motion thank you representative tyrany
 
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative wall thank you Mr
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee this
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
is a very sensitive issue obviously all
 
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
of us have had family member and Friends
 
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
who've been in Military and recognize
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
the importance of recognizing them even
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
after they've passed uh we heard just
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
testimony that even with this bill the
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
American flag would always drape the
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
casket of those who have passed or been
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
beside the uh n or whatever that holds
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
the ashes of someone who's
 
00:32:11.789 --> 00:32:11.799 align:start position:0%
passed but there is a concern that this
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
was a commercial Enterprise to begin
 
00:32:15.629 --> 00:32:15.639 align:start position:0%
with it started by one person who formed
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
a company it is a beautiful flag but
 
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to say we can't at our
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
homes or even in our communities fly the
 
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
flags we want but to say that the state
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
has to do it on certain days for certain
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
occasions following up on representative
 
00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:34.039 align:start position:0%
attorney's testimony um is inappropriate
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
at this time the I did research on this
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
this bill has been before us five other
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
times and has failed for all the same
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
reasons that we've heard in terms of the
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
fact that it is a commercial effort even
 
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
though it's a beautiful flag um that
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's up to an individual or family or
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
whatever to do what they want with it
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
but to say the state has to fly it at
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
certain times over the State House
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh is not going to work so I thank you
 
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
very much and by the way it does fly at
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
the Veteran Cemetery and that is totally
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
appropriate for we recognize that in
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
honor of that thank
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative well uh
 
00:33:12.559 --> 00:33:15.990 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative well uh
further

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
discussion so I would just like to say
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
um I too um feel the sensitivity of of
 
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
the issue um we all have feelings and uh
 
00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:33.559 align:start position:0%
and for anyone that has lost a a service
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
member um this is a commercial operation
 
00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:41.559 align:start position:0%
um you can go on their website at this
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
point in time and and order one of these
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
flags if it would provide your family
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
comfort um some of them actually come I
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
believe um personalized for the service
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
member uh directly um we did have
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Veteran Cemetery and
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
and that flag is being flown there um
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
the question was also asked about uh
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
whether it was part of the national flag
 
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
code and um in my understanding and and
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
research is that it's been attempted
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
since 2010 federally um to have it
 
00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
adopted and uh and has died on the table
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
um they have a different system than we
 
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.470 align:start position:0%
um they have a different system than we
do

00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't seem that nationally
 
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
it has the support um in order to be
 
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839 align:start position:0%
part of the uh uh the flag code in the
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
same way that um our current flag our
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
current um US flag the pmia flag um is
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
part of that federal system and our
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
system um and we do have a problem um
 
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
beyond the the philosophical problem we
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
have a physical problem um the the flag
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
poles that we have on the State House
 
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
have difficulty uh with just the US flag
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
and the pmia flag on days of half Mass
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
um it's it's very close for the PW flag
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
to be actually not touching the the roof
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the state house so somewhere along
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
the line something has to happen with uh
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
with that circumstance but um but it
 
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
would be very difficult and there was
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
nothing in the legislation that I saw
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
that addressed what happens on those
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
days when this flag was supposed to be
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
flown that um that happened to be a half
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
Mass day um we we were left to try to um
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
leave it up to whoever is posting the
 
00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
flags I guess I have no idea um
 
00:36:00.309 --> 00:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
but at any rate um I
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
am lamenting somewhat that we weren't
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
able to do
 
00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
something um I would I would recommend I
 
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
guess to the prime sponsor to uh to look
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
at the language of the of the bill and
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps resubmit um but I'm not sure
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
given our limitations and um the fact
 
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
that it's it's not been recognized by um
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
by flag military flag code at this point
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
that U I think it faces an uphill battle
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
so with that um being said uh no other
 
00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
conversation that I can see um I'll ask
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the rooll for itl on
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%

no contradiction to consent is there any
 
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
objection seeing none uh bill will be on
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
consent and we'll take a few minutes
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%

session on House Bill 1495 making
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
Provisions for the P perspective of all
 
00:38:59.309 --> 00:38:59.319 align:start position:0%
leg legislative acts on a sliding scale
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
based on the vote count when passed by
 
00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:03.319 align:start position:0%
the House of
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives um I tend to call this
 
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
the automatic repeal bill um so I would
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%

speak to your motion sure um I I
 
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
completely understand and agree with the
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
intention of this measure to minimize
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
the number of duplicative and
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
ineffective laws on the the books um and
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
this this motion um we heard testimony
 
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
that it would ignore the other body um
 
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
as we are a bamal um body and unless a
 
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment changes that uh
 
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note which we know uh
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
this measure would be um this measure
 
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
would be uh would require uh quite a bit
 
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
of work
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
um we also feel that any legislator can
 
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
add a sunset provision to their um
 
00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
legislation going forward so for this
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
reason we are uh asking
 
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
for uh support for an itl motion
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%

agree thank you very much for that uh
 
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
wall thank you Mr chairman all I'll add
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
to it is we had strong testimony from
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
the house clerk that this would require
 
00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
further uh Employments of staff there is
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
no fiscal not as you've heard on this
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
and there should be there must be if
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to be spending money uh
 
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
there's a question of constitu excuse me
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
constitutionality on this um is just
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
problematic all the way around thank
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%

00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
discussion I would just
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
say there was a discussion during
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
testimony that the idea was to reduce
 
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
down the number of bills um with this
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
and I failed to understand that point of
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
view I uh um I would see this as adding
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
to the number of bills that we would
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
have in a given year um I also am
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
concerned that there would be um
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity for um for lapses in um very
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
important laws that wouldn't be passed
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
or or wouldn't be on the books at the
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
time that they would be automatically
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
repealed prior to them being
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
reinstated um there was nothing in the
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
legislation that um for instance
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
Exempted criminal justice uh legislation
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
so um you know you can Envision a
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
circumstance where a a a very serious
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
crime um couldn't be charged because
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
there was nothing on the books at the
 
00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
time because it had been um um
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
automatically repealed and hadn't been
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
reinstated as yet so um while it's an
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
interesting idea and I don't ever want
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
to squelch the possibility of
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
interesting ideas coming down the pike
 
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
but um but this one needed some serious
 
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh serious work much more so than
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
anything that the committee was um would
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
be capable with time and and duty to
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
actually accomplish uh yes
 
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
representative wall thank you Mr
 
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
chairman I I simply want to clarify for
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
some members who weren't here for
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and back up what you've said
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
the fact that the additional staff would
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
be a dedicated person just to follow
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
every single bill that ever gets passed
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
into law and that means that person
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
would have to follow each bill until the
 
00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
fifth year comes when that bill then
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
becomes null and void it's almost an
 
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
impossible task and there are bills that
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
really should continue laws that should
 
00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:46.839 align:start position:0%
continue forever does that mean we would
 
00:43:49.549 --> 00:43:49.559 align:start position:0%
have to every five years resubmit a bill
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
for a law that works um it just is a
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
complicated problem thank you
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative well um I
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
neglected to bring up the the second
 
00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
part of the bill which was the um the
 
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
petition approach of requiring 100 um
 
00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
signatures on a I don't think they use
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
the word petition but I will um on the
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
petition to create
 
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
um any existing bill would come up with
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
100 signatures would have to be um
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
rediscussed and and red debated and
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
revoted um I'm not sure the need for
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
that because it would seem to me and all
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
of us in this room
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
um have been witnessed uh or been
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
approached by a single member of the
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
public who have asked us to uh file
 
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
legislation um to
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
repeal any number of laws um and that's
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
done with one one just one person asking
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
us to do it uh so I'm not sure what the
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
the value is to having a 100 people do
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
it um or what would be accomplished by
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
having a 100 people asked to be um
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
repealing it bill so with that um if
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
there is no further discussion um I'll
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call a roll on House
 
00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:23.319 align:start position:0%

03:02:57.150 --> 03:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
workshops
 
03:03:01.550 --> 03:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
um and other things um so this is my
 
03:03:03.550 --> 03:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
sixth year as a
 
03:03:05.950 --> 03:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
legislator and
 
03:03:09.070 --> 03:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
um as legislators you know are we
 
03:03:11.750 --> 03:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
employees or are we not employees it's
 
03:03:14.070 --> 03:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a gray area you know we're
 
03:03:16.150 --> 03:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to buy
 
03:03:19.590 --> 03:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
insurance um if we need it I buy our our
 
03:03:21.910 --> 03:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
dental plan you know and the rest of my
 
03:03:25.790 --> 03:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
stuff is Medicare because I'm older um
 
03:03:29.469 --> 03:03:29.479 align:start position:0%
but over the years my six six years in
 
03:03:32.550 --> 03:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature uh I have been concerned
 
03:03:34.750 --> 03:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
about some of my colleagues in the
 
03:03:37.790 --> 03:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
legislature someone who's had a recent
 
03:03:41.269 --> 03:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
bement um someone who has a child
 
03:03:44.110 --> 03:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
suffering from drug addiction
 
03:03:47.229 --> 03:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
um someone whose spouse is has a
 
03:03:49.630 --> 03:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
gambling addiction and you know all
 
03:03:51.670 --> 03:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things and I have
 
03:03:54.229 --> 03:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
occasionally approached a fellow
 
03:03:56.309 --> 03:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
legislator and say you know have you got
 
03:03:59.110 --> 03:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
somebody to talk to uh do you have a
 
03:04:02.190 --> 03:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
therapist you know and then there was an
 
03:04:05.229 --> 03:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
incident I won't go into about a person
 
03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
and and I asked them I said do you have
 
03:04:10.870 --> 03:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
insurance like can you afford to pay a
 
03:04:13.830 --> 03:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
counselor if if you needed one and ear I
 
03:04:15.710 --> 03:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
thought they needed one and she goes
 
03:04:19.309 --> 03:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
well yes yes I do but the employee
 
03:04:22.110 --> 03:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
assistance program which many employers
 
03:04:27.389 --> 03:04:27.399 align:start position:0%
offer is a wonderful referral program um
 
03:04:30.510 --> 03:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
so any of those uh previous problems
 
03:04:33.990 --> 03:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
that I listed they can hook you up with
 
03:04:37.389 --> 03:04:37.399 align:start position:0%
someone right away and I made use at one
 
03:04:40.550 --> 03:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
of my previous jobs more paid than this
 
03:04:40.560 --> 03:04:42.030 align:start position:0%
of my previous jobs more paid than this
one

03:04:42.030 --> 03:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:04:44.550 --> 03:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
um I was was having an issue I kind of
 
03:04:46.750 --> 03:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to hash out with someone not a
 
03:04:51.229 --> 03:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
family member so I made use of um they
 
03:04:54.349 --> 03:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
connected me with a counselor and I was
 
03:04:59.110 --> 03:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
approved for five sessions so and um Mr
 
03:05:02.630 --> 03:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
Lawless in the back he'll be he runs the
 
03:05:04.229 --> 03:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
program so he'll explain a little bit
 
03:05:06.910 --> 03:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
more if you have more detailed questions
 
03:05:10.349 --> 03:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
so right now if you were to try and get
 
03:05:12.469 --> 03:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh an appointment with a counselor you
 
03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
could be waiting months I hope you've
 
03:05:17.349 --> 03:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
heard those stories or longer but
 
03:05:20.950 --> 03:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
Employee Assistance programs has um
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
Professionals in many of these
 
03:05:24.429 --> 03:05:24.439 align:start position:0%
professions sort of waiting for a
 
03:05:27.870 --> 03:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
referral like they get top priority so
 
03:05:30.950 --> 03:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
it was like seven years ago that I made
 
03:05:33.630 --> 03:05:33.640 align:start position:0%
use of it and you know within a week I
 
03:05:35.910 --> 03:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
got to see somebody and I I got to work
 
03:05:39.870 --> 03:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
out my issue and so I just think the
 
03:05:42.910 --> 03:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
stressors that we go through I mean the
 
03:05:44.910 --> 03:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
public goes through it too but in the
 
03:05:46.910 --> 03:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
six years that I've been here sometimes
 
03:05:48.990 --> 03:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
people get death threats from
 
03:05:51.950 --> 03:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
constituents or non-c constituents we go
 
03:05:55.309 --> 03:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
through some heavy stuff we hear
 
03:05:59.670 --> 03:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking testimony and I just think
 
03:06:03.269 --> 03:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
um for the amount of sacrifice that we
 
03:06:06.070 --> 03:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
make as legislators to be here that this
 
03:06:09.309 --> 03:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
would be a very nice perk to offer
 
03:06:12.710 --> 03:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
ourselves and our Senators the cost the
 
03:06:16.229 --> 03:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
last page um gives a little bit of a
 
03:06:20.110 --> 03:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
financial um analysis and it's pretty
 
03:06:22.710 --> 03:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
cheap so and
 
03:06:25.790 --> 03:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
um attorney Williams will speak a little
 
03:06:29.750 --> 03:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
bit of the mechanics of that um but it
 
03:06:33.110 --> 03:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
would be somewhere in like $40 a year
 
03:06:36.269 --> 03:06:36.279 align:start position:0%
per person and the um
 
03:06:39.150 --> 03:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
agency has assured me that they have the
 
03:06:43.389 --> 03:06:43.399 align:start position:0%
capacity to handle our 400 legislators
 
03:06:48.070 --> 03:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
and our 24 Senators I have um Mr Lawless
 
03:06:50.070 --> 03:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
brought them today um Employee
 
03:06:53.070 --> 03:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
Assistance programs some um pamphlets if
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
you'd like to look them over later I'll
 
03:06:58.750 --> 03:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
I'll leave them here on the table and um
 
03:07:01.790 --> 03:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
some larger pamphlets that explain so I
 
03:07:05.710 --> 03:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
think this is needed that we feel that
 
03:07:08.070 --> 03:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
um our legislators ourselves are getting
 
03:07:10.389 --> 03:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
the support that we need and that we
 
03:07:15.030 --> 03:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
have easy access to help when we need it
 
03:07:17.910 --> 03:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
03:07:21.630 --> 03:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:07:24.550 --> 03:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
um you are willing to take questions in
 
03:07:26.950 --> 03:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
light of the fact that we have experts
 
03:07:32.429 --> 03:07:32.439 align:start position:0%
here um well yes um or sure so why don't
 
03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
if I can't answer it then I'll call them
 
03:07:37.670 --> 03:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
up so um actually I think I'll call them
 
03:07:40.550 --> 03:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
up so so let's uh let's see how this
 
03:07:42.750 --> 03:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
goes Sor I didn't mean to overstep no um
 
03:07:44.950 --> 03:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
so um I that's my presentation and I
 
03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
think the the nitty-gritty the two
 
03:07:49.950 --> 03:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
gentlemen coming up will explain better
 
03:07:52.510 --> 03:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
great so let's see hope you'll consider
 
03:07:53.870 --> 03:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
this bill let's see if there are
 
03:07:56.790 --> 03:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
questions first um are there any
 
03:07:59.630 --> 03:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
questions for the prime
 
03:08:02.309 --> 03:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor seeing none you're off the hook
 
03:08:05.150 --> 03:08:05.160 align:start position:0%

engaged by representative um Nutter upam
 
03:09:33.030 --> 03:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
on this bill also with the co-sponsor uh

03:09:37.389 --> 03:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
representative Joseph Pio but also note
 
03:09:39.190 --> 03:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
that we have represent Pearson not
 
03:09:40.670 --> 03:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily the Pearson that's on this
 
03:09:42.990 --> 03:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh but the senior Mark Pearson
 
03:09:44.229 --> 03:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
who's also a co-sponsor in this
 
03:09:46.309 --> 03:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
legislation my involvement with this
 
03:09:48.790 --> 03:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
bill happened early in the Autumn of
 
03:09:51.070 --> 03:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
this year when our agency received the
 
03:09:52.670 --> 03:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
confidential request from the
 
03:09:54.510 --> 03:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
legislative budget Assistance Office to
 
03:09:56.429 --> 03:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
conduct a financial review of this very
 
03:09:58.670 --> 03:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
important bill that allowed me to to
 
03:10:00.950 --> 03:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
match up with our wonderful program
 
03:10:03.870 --> 03:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
folks here our director for the the
 
03:10:05.910 --> 03:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
employee assistance program to get a
 
03:10:08.110 --> 03:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
handle on what this program would do
 
03:10:09.750 --> 03:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
from a financial perspective I know this
 
03:10:11.710 --> 03:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
is a policy committee but at some point
 
03:10:14.110 --> 03:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
and because I have the for former house
 
03:10:16.670 --> 03:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh chair um behind me over here this
 
03:10:18.349 --> 03:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
likely if it does pass your committee
 
03:10:20.429 --> 03:10:20.439 align:start position:0%
will certainly work very collaboratively
 
03:10:22.070 --> 03:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
with either division three which is the
 
03:10:23.710 --> 03:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:10:25.630 --> 03:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
Division and whatever respective
 
03:10:28.590 --> 03:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
division works on um legislative ad uh
 
03:10:30.150 --> 03:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
legislative matters or legislative
 
03:10:32.710 --> 03:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
Financial um matters so in working
 
03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
through this the department contracts
 
03:10:37.910 --> 03:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
out with um several if not All State
 
03:10:39.710 --> 03:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
agencies looking at Mr Lawless confirm
 
03:10:42.070 --> 03:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
that and as part of that arrangement we
 
03:10:44.389 --> 03:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
enter into contract and that contract
 
03:10:45.910 --> 03:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
with those agencies to provide these
 
03:10:47.550 --> 03:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
Services which he will be explaining to
 
03:10:49.870 --> 03:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
you these very uh very critical helpful
 
03:10:52.590 --> 03:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
services to support our state employees
 
03:10:54.510 --> 03:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
that we contract with each uh separate
 
03:10:56.990 --> 03:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
state agency and we give them the exact
 
03:10:58.590 --> 03:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
parody in other words the exact dollar
 
03:11:01.429 --> 03:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
amount per person within that particular
 
03:11:03.349 --> 03:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
agency that we' be potentially providing
 
03:11:05.670 --> 03:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
services to so it's reflected in the
 
03:11:07.510 --> 03:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis that the legislative
 
03:11:10.150 --> 03:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
budget assistance has done uh uh as part
 
03:11:12.990 --> 03:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
of this bill and also uh what was
 
03:11:15.269 --> 03:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned by the bill sponsor in in the
 
03:11:17.030 --> 03:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
introduction that it we're looking at
 
03:11:19.870 --> 03:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
around $40 plus per person for entering
 
03:11:21.710 --> 03:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
to that contract as you'll see from the
 
03:11:24.229 --> 03:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
financial analysis that the legislative
 
03:11:26.030 --> 03:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
um Financial managers also were
 
03:11:28.190 --> 03:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
contacted by the LBA and conducted their
 
03:11:30.590 --> 03:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
analysis and it represented in here that
 
03:11:32.590 --> 03:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
they they feel they can absorb or at
 
03:11:33.790 --> 03:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
least it's stated that this can be
 
03:11:35.510 --> 03:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
absorbed in their budget for purpos of
 
03:11:38.070 --> 03:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
making this happen um I would represent
 
03:11:40.229 --> 03:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
to you not at this realm but at the next
 
03:11:42.389 --> 03:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
realm before the finance committee that
 
03:11:43.910 --> 03:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
we just want to make sure that our
 
03:11:45.710 --> 03:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
financial folks in our agency are
 
03:11:47.630 --> 03:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
communicating with your financial folks
 
03:11:49.349 --> 03:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
because if this is a good idea and you
 
03:11:51.389 --> 03:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
agree that it's a good idea and it's not
 
03:11:52.910 --> 03:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of money that we're talking about
 
03:11:54.710 --> 03:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
and the legislature seems to have that
 
03:11:56.469 --> 03:11:56.479 align:start position:0%
money we just have to make sure because
 
03:11:58.870 --> 03:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is an interde departmental transfer
 
03:12:00.429 --> 03:12:00.439 align:start position:0%
that our financial people are talking to
 
03:12:01.830 --> 03:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
each other to make sure the language in
 
03:12:04.990 --> 03:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is absolutely 100% either no
 
03:12:06.950 --> 03:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
barriers or at least commensurate with
 
03:12:08.190 --> 03:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
what they need for transferring the
 
03:12:09.830 --> 03:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
language and I just raised that so that
 
03:12:11.510 --> 03:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
you're not surprised if you see any
 
03:12:13.590 --> 03:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
further amendments as this bill moves
 
03:12:16.349 --> 03:12:16.359 align:start position:0%
along so as far as any questions
 
03:12:18.469 --> 03:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
regarding like the fiscal piece of this
 
03:12:20.110 --> 03:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn it over to what really
 
03:12:21.910 --> 03:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
is important which is the policy side of
 
03:12:24.790 --> 03:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
the conversation and so with the um uh
 
03:12:26.469 --> 03:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
keeping within less than five minutes
 
03:12:27.710 --> 03:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
which is our goal I think we're about
 
03:12:29.030 --> 03:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
three minutes right now I'll turn it
 
03:12:32.150 --> 03:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
over to Mr Wallace thank you I'm hoping
 
03:12:33.710 --> 03:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
I have the same kind of sense of time
 
03:12:35.590 --> 03:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
management because I I I'm really
 
03:12:37.950 --> 03:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
passionate about EAP and I really uh
 
03:12:40.150 --> 03:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
appreciative for for this uh audience to
 
03:12:42.750 --> 03:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit about the program
 
03:12:44.429 --> 03:12:44.439 align:start position:0%
there's so much to say you know I'm
 
03:12:46.510 --> 03:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who uh I'm really invested in
 
03:12:48.590 --> 03:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
the idea of people having access to
 
03:12:50.630 --> 03:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
resources and supports and challenging
 
03:12:52.990 --> 03:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
stigma and and finding a way to uh
 
03:12:54.670 --> 03:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
navigate the challenges that can show up
 
03:12:56.710 --> 03:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
for any one of us in our journey you
 
03:12:57.990 --> 03:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
know that's one of the things that we
 
03:12:59.910 --> 03:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
try to impress upon folks in whatever
 
03:13:02.269 --> 03:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
audience we're in is
 
03:13:05.030 --> 03:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
that we're people too right regardless
 
03:13:06.990 --> 03:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
of the station you hold you have family
 
03:13:08.309 --> 03:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
members who may be dealing with things
 
03:13:10.030 --> 03:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
you yourself may be dealing with things
 
03:13:12.870 --> 03:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
you know we we see uh state employees be
 
03:13:14.990 --> 03:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
struggling with housing insecurity food
 
03:13:17.790 --> 03:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
insecurity anything that any uh other
 
03:13:19.710 --> 03:13:19.720 align:start position:0%
citizen of the state may be accessing
 
03:13:21.710 --> 03:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
resources around can directly impact any
 
03:13:26.070 --> 03:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
one of us or our family members um so to
 
03:13:27.830 --> 03:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
that point you know we serve all All
 
03:13:30.070 --> 03:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
State agencies all state employees from
 
03:13:31.910 --> 03:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
entry level positions up to the uh
 
03:13:33.790 --> 03:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner level and uh it's a
 
03:13:35.469 --> 03:13:35.479 align:start position:0%
confidential program we've been granted
 
03:13:37.229 --> 03:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
uh confidentiality at the level of
 
03:13:39.349 --> 03:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
attorney client so truly what's said
 
03:13:41.630 --> 03:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
with us stays with us we're also
 
03:13:43.590 --> 03:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
available to state employees uh members
 
03:13:45.190 --> 03:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
of their household family members the
 
03:13:46.590 --> 03:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
family member gets the same kind of
 
03:13:48.510 --> 03:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
confidentiality that the state employee
 
03:13:52.229 --> 03:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
would as well you know based on uh
 
03:13:54.110 --> 03:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
language and the administrative rules
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
employees are allotted three hours per
 
03:13:58.550 --> 03:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
year to access the agency should they
 
03:14:01.150 --> 03:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
choose to or a voluntary program we're
 
03:14:05.030 --> 03:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
also not kind of monitoring the uh
 
03:14:06.630 --> 03:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes people will come for one
 
03:14:08.389 --> 03:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
meeting or a phone session or remote
 
03:14:10.590 --> 03:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
kind of connection sometimes it goes
 
03:14:11.830 --> 03:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
beyond three sessions we're not
 
03:14:13.710 --> 03:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
communicating back to their supervisors
 
03:14:16.510 --> 03:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
their HR anyone really what's said with
 
03:14:18.510 --> 03:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
us stays with us unless a releasees sign
 
03:14:20.550 --> 03:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
so that some communication can occur by
 
03:14:23.190 --> 03:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
the employee themselves we also travel
 
03:14:25.150 --> 03:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
and meet folks out in the community if
 
03:14:26.630 --> 03:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
that's a place that they would prefer to
 
03:14:28.910 --> 03:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
meet our main office location is here in
 
03:14:30.750 --> 03:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
conquer but we want folks regardless of
 
03:14:32.070 --> 03:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
where they are in the state to have the
 
03:14:34.429 --> 03:14:34.439 align:start position:0%
same access to us uh that anybody here
 
03:14:37.110 --> 03:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
in conquer would have access to us and
 
03:14:39.630 --> 03:14:39.640 align:start position:0%
so you know these these brochures really
 
03:14:41.309 --> 03:14:41.319 align:start position:0%
start to paint the picture of Direct
 
03:14:43.510 --> 03:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
Services that we may be able to kind of
 
03:14:45.510 --> 03:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
provide folks a resource around the
 
03:14:47.710 --> 03:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
program has been effect since 1985 it
 
03:14:50.229 --> 03:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
started as a pilot program and has uh
 
03:14:52.389 --> 03:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
grown considerably through the years and
 
03:14:54.150 --> 03:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
I think that's based on the fact that we
 
03:14:55.750 --> 03:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
have a great reputation around
 
03:14:57.150 --> 03:14:57.160 align:start position:0%
confidentiality but also our
 
03:14:58.670 --> 03:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
Partnerships in the community to make
 
03:15:01.110 --> 03:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
sure that if somebody has a a need or
 
03:15:02.710 --> 03:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
needs some support around an area it's
 
03:15:04.269 --> 03:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
our job to help them connect with that
 
03:15:06.670 --> 03:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
resource and we take that seriously you
 
03:15:08.349 --> 03:15:08.359 align:start position:0%
know this is not a place where you're
 
03:15:10.070 --> 03:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
making cold calls to try to find a
 
03:15:11.550 --> 03:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
clinician if that's what you need that's
 
03:15:12.990 --> 03:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
what your family member needs
 
03:15:14.990 --> 03:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're bridging that Gap I'm
 
03:15:16.630 --> 03:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
not going to refer I'm not going to give
 
03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
a number and a name to anybody unless I
 
03:15:20.429 --> 03:15:20.439 align:start position:0%
would go to that person myself or feel
 
03:15:21.830 --> 03:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable with my family member going
 
03:15:24.150 --> 03:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
to so we know about the person we refer
 
03:15:26.830 --> 03:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
you to uh or family we've had a
 
03:15:28.870 --> 03:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
relationship or or an Outreach call
 
03:15:30.269 --> 03:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
contact with them we know they accept
 
03:15:31.870 --> 03:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
the insurance that you have and we know
 
03:15:33.670 --> 03:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
that they have availability in the their
 
03:15:36.469 --> 03:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
schedule to bridge that Gap and really
 
03:15:38.710 --> 03:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
the range of services we offer while
 
03:15:41.189 --> 03:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
this is an individual uh pamphlet about
 
03:15:42.830 --> 03:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
Individual Services this this is more
 
03:15:45.429 --> 03:15:45.439 align:start position:0%
like a supervisor's kind of guide but I
 
03:15:47.030 --> 03:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
think that's an important piece to the
 
03:15:48.950 --> 03:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
equation too because the service
 
03:15:50.950 --> 03:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
delivery system that we offer is very
 
03:15:52.830 --> 03:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
robust so if anybody is familiar with
 
03:15:55.630 --> 03:15:55.640 align:start position:0%
eaps some eaps you might call A 1 1800
 
03:15:57.189 --> 03:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
number or number and talk to somebody
 
03:15:59.389 --> 03:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
two states over we're citizens of the
 
03:16:02.630 --> 03:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
state we're uh you know employees of the
 
03:16:04.590 --> 03:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
state we live in the same neighborhoods
 
03:16:06.389 --> 03:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
that folks may be accessing resources
 
03:16:08.349 --> 03:16:08.359 align:start position:0%
and so we have that Personal Touch right
 
03:16:10.429 --> 03:16:10.439 align:start position:0%
so it's not just the face Toof face in a
 
03:16:12.550 --> 03:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
referral system a cold kind of referral
 
03:16:15.870 --> 03:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
system we cover the the full range of
 
03:16:17.469 --> 03:16:17.479 align:start position:0%
any issue that an employee might be
 
03:16:20.030 --> 03:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
bringing into the workspace anything a
 
03:16:23.229 --> 03:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
supervisor uh commissioner family member
 
03:16:24.670 --> 03:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
anything that anybody might be dealing
 
03:16:26.189 --> 03:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
with our job is to be present be
 
03:16:27.469 --> 03:16:27.479 align:start position:0%
available and try to find them the
 
03:16:28.950 --> 03:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
support and resources that they might
 
03:16:30.910 --> 03:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
need to deal with that challenge Beyond
 
03:16:32.710 --> 03:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
The Individual Services piece that we
 
03:16:36.189 --> 03:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
offer we do trainings we do orientations
 
03:16:38.429 --> 03:16:38.439 align:start position:0%
uh mediation if two folks are having a
 
03:16:40.670 --> 03:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
hard time kind of meeting in the middle
 
03:16:42.790 --> 03:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
the range of services that we off offer
 
03:16:44.429 --> 03:16:44.439 align:start position:0%
whether it's a critical incident stress
 
03:16:44.439 --> 03:16:45.469 align:start position:0%
whether it's a critical incident stress
management

03:16:45.469 --> 03:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
management
 
03:16:47.910 --> 03:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
debriefings there's really a lot to say
 
03:16:49.349 --> 03:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
right I I could really kind of do a deep
 
03:16:51.469 --> 03:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
dive on any of these areas because I'm
 
03:16:53.070 --> 03:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
passionate about the program and we do
 
03:16:55.309 --> 03:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
amazing work so I want to open it up if
 
03:16:57.429 --> 03:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
if that's okay and see if anybody yeah
 
03:16:59.950 --> 03:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
and just just a very clearly State they
 
03:17:02.070 --> 03:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
they really came through during the
 
03:17:03.590 --> 03:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
tragedy that we had in New Hampshire
 
03:17:05.429 --> 03:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
hospital uh providing support to our
 
03:17:07.349 --> 03:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
staff whether it was from a behavioral
 
03:17:08.990 --> 03:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
health standpoint because this is what
 
03:17:11.269 --> 03:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
they do if you have a gaming addiction
 
03:17:14.269 --> 03:17:14.279 align:start position:0%
or something use issue coing disorders
 
03:17:16.590 --> 03:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
they can help you very much how to deal
 
03:17:17.630 --> 03:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
with this and that's why the
 
03:17:20.429 --> 03:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
confidentiality provision is out there
 
03:17:21.830 --> 03:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
very much similar if you were going to a
 
03:17:23.830 --> 03:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
doctor's office to talk to them to
 
03:17:25.389 --> 03:17:25.399 align:start position:0%
protect that information and keep it
 
03:17:27.150 --> 03:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
confidential so you can get those needed
 
03:17:28.950 --> 03:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
Services because everybody at some point
 
03:17:31.590 --> 03:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
in time does need to have something
 
03:17:33.990 --> 03:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
addressed in in life um that happens to
 
03:17:34.950 --> 03:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
them so I just want to make it really
 
03:17:36.790 --> 03:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
clear when we're talking of services it
 
03:17:38.510 --> 03:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's a whole gamut from everything you
 
03:17:40.189 --> 03:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
can imagine that people need help with
 
03:17:41.830 --> 03:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
including those of us who work for the
 
03:17:41.840 --> 03:17:42.750 align:start position:0%
including those of us who work for the
Department

03:17:42.750 --> 03:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
Department
 
03:17:44.750 --> 03:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm and respectfully all the
 
03:17:46.189 --> 03:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
wonderful people that I get to work with
 
03:17:47.750 --> 03:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
at the legislature as well could Avail
 
03:17:49.510 --> 03:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
themselves of these
 
03:17:53.630 --> 03:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
services and and with that I I I I would
 
03:17:55.269 --> 03:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
just say when we think about a range
 
03:17:56.870 --> 03:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
right it could be anything from I'm
 
03:17:58.590 --> 03:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
having difficulty with a conversation
 
03:18:00.590 --> 03:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
with a with a colleague and you know
 
03:18:02.349 --> 03:18:02.359 align:start position:0%
they're they're not receptive to to
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
anything around needing Direct Services
 
03:18:06.830 --> 03:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
and I've had the the honor the you know
 
03:18:08.630 --> 03:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
I never have the right words but
 
03:18:10.590 --> 03:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
multiple times in my career to talk with
 
03:18:11.910 --> 03:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
somebody who said I've been diagnosed
 
03:18:13.349 --> 03:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
with a terminal illness I'm want to make
 
03:18:15.469 --> 03:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
sure my family members are able to
 
03:18:17.070 --> 03:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
access the resources that are available
 
03:18:19.110 --> 03:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
to them through my position so we cover
 
03:18:21.910 --> 03:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
the the full range coming for in
 
03:18:23.790 --> 03:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir thank you very
 
03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony um they have
 
03:18:31.510 --> 03:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
agreed to take questions um rip conable
 
03:18:34.030 --> 03:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
question number one uh thank you Mr
 
03:18:36.110 --> 03:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:18:40.150 --> 03:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
question um it was sort of stated by the
 
03:18:42.630 --> 03:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor that there's a great area in
 
03:18:44.309 --> 03:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
terms of whether we're employeers or not
 
03:18:46.990 --> 03:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
but I I don't see it that way we we are
 
03:18:49.790 --> 03:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
not state employees so what is the
 
03:18:52.030 --> 03:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
mechanism here that that we're going to
 
03:18:54.510 --> 03:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
allow non-state employees participate in
 
03:19:00.510 --> 03:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:03.950 --> 03:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
program it's a very good question um and
 
03:19:06.750 --> 03:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
the um at least no one has identified
 
03:19:09.790 --> 03:19:09.800 align:start position:0%
any legal barriers as to the fact that a
 
03:19:11.429 --> 03:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
um member of the legislature couldn't
 
03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
Avail himself Services I think the key
 
03:19:15.870 --> 03:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
here is the resources needed by our
 
03:19:17.950 --> 03:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
agency to be able to provide them to
 
03:19:19.590 --> 03:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
this with the same question I and I
 
03:19:21.469 --> 03:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
think it is a very fair question
 
03:19:24.150 --> 03:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
represent conable that um let's say that
 
03:19:25.630 --> 03:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch decided that they
 
03:19:27.189 --> 03:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
would like to also Avail it would be a
 
03:19:28.990 --> 03:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
very similar process and I'm not aware
 
03:19:31.150 --> 03:19:31.160 align:start position:0%
of any legal barriers and certainly you
 
03:19:33.269 --> 03:19:33.279 align:start position:0%
can check in with your legal counsel for
 
03:19:35.189 --> 03:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
the house just to double up on that to
 
03:19:36.469 --> 03:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
making sure that there isn't something
 
03:19:37.870 --> 03:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
that we're not aware of but I'm I'm not
 
03:19:39.550 --> 03:19:39.560 align:start position:0%
aware of any barriers for providing
 
03:19:42.030 --> 03:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
these services in fact uh we were
 
03:19:43.830 --> 03:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
approached at the political subdivision
 
03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
level I would agree that that we're
 
03:19:47.429 --> 03:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
talking still executive branch in nature
 
03:19:49.150 --> 03:19:49.160 align:start position:0%
but talking about either the county or
 
03:19:51.150 --> 03:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
Municipal level so for example State
 
03:19:53.150 --> 03:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
Police State Police can Avail themselves
 
03:19:55.830 --> 03:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
and do Avail themselves of the employee
 
03:19:58.670 --> 03:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
assistance program and it became so well
 
03:19:59.990 --> 03:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
known that it was so helpful
 
03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
particularly for those who are structal
 
03:20:03.110 --> 03:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
jobs such as our law enforcement
 
03:20:04.950 --> 03:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
officers that local law enforcement
 
03:20:06.630 --> 03:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
agencies also wanted to Avail themselves
 
03:20:09.110 --> 03:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
so we had Outreach from uh local law
 
03:20:10.750 --> 03:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement to provide those Services as
 
03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
well so it it has been discussed before
 
03:20:17.110 --> 03:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:21.150 --> 03:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:24.030 --> 03:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
sers thank you Mr chair uh I heard you
 
03:20:26.630 --> 03:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
say um something about three hours uh
 
03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
what happens if the time goes over three
 
03:20:31.349 --> 03:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
hours who ends up paying or what goes on
 
03:20:33.910 --> 03:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
there yes I can I I appreciate the
 
03:20:36.110 --> 03:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
question you know that the way that we
 
03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
handle that my philosophy on that and
 
03:20:40.110 --> 03:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
and one that was inherited I'm I'm in
 
03:20:42.790 --> 03:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
the director role here uh since October
 
03:20:45.070 --> 03:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
of 22 our previous director had been in
 
03:20:47.870 --> 03:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
since 19 I believe 85 really so the
 
03:20:50.710 --> 03:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
culture is established and to that point
 
03:20:53.630 --> 03:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
um you know we our role is not to uh
 
03:20:56.030 --> 03:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
report back to supervisors or HR really
 
03:20:57.269 --> 03:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
that's kind of negotiated by the
 
03:20:58.590 --> 03:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
employee if that's something that they
 
03:21:00.389 --> 03:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
have to address in their in their kind
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
of employment role the same thing is you
 
03:21:04.670 --> 03:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
know that that really is something that
 
03:21:07.870 --> 03:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
we look at internally to be sure that um
 
03:21:09.510 --> 03:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
those can be difficult conversations
 
03:21:10.710 --> 03:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes depending on kind of how the
 
03:21:12.389 --> 03:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
Rapport is developed and and a and a
 
03:21:13.870 --> 03:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
sense of safety and things like that and
 
03:21:16.429 --> 03:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
so that's all considered and to me it
 
03:21:19.510 --> 03:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
would never be just because somebody hit
 
03:21:21.710 --> 03:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
three sessions that we are now kind of
 
03:21:23.950 --> 03:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
done right it's always a conversation
 
03:21:25.630 --> 03:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
around how can this be helpful is this
 
03:21:27.510 --> 03:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
supportive those are conversations we're
 
03:21:29.590 --> 03:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
considering in the EAP role is there
 
03:21:31.269 --> 03:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
another resource externally that might
 
03:21:33.110 --> 03:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
be more appropriate but we are always
 
03:21:34.590 --> 03:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
going to air to the side of being
 
03:21:37.030 --> 03:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
supportive being present and and and and
 
03:21:39.229 --> 03:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
negotiating those situations on an
 
03:21:41.389 --> 03:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
individual level and this is one of
 
03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
those rare ations that actually the
 
03:21:45.150 --> 03:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable subject matter expert said
 
03:21:47.229 --> 03:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
it in more words than the attorney would
 
03:21:49.070 --> 03:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh I I think the answer that I heard to
 
03:21:51.150 --> 03:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
the question was that if you exceed the
 
03:21:53.229 --> 03:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
three hours that we would not be seeking
 
03:21:55.189 --> 03:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
further money from that individual and
 
03:21:56.630 --> 03:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's a clear I think a clear answer to
 
03:21:58.910 --> 03:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
your question I'm sorry I can't answer
 
03:22:01.070 --> 03:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
that you can't that's great no no
 
03:22:02.550 --> 03:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
there's no there's never a cost to
 
03:22:04.990 --> 03:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
individuals accessing Services there's
 
03:22:06.750 --> 03:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
um thank
 
03:22:09.870 --> 03:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
you other
 
03:22:13.590 --> 03:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
questions I have a couple
 
03:22:16.710 --> 03:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
um so my first question is um I'm
 
03:22:22.229 --> 03:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
assuming this this is um adding in 14a
 
03:22:26.950 --> 03:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
Colon 7 14a colon 6 talks about our the
 
03:22:29.389 --> 03:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
group participation and group concerns
 
03:22:31.750 --> 03:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
participation for members of the general
 
03:22:35.309 --> 03:22:35.319 align:start position:0%
court um and the very first line says at
 
03:22:40.630 --> 03:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
their own expense in this case um we are
 
03:22:43.550 --> 03:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
we are making it the expense of the
 
03:22:45.830 --> 03:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire um that are
 
03:22:50.110 --> 03:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
going to pay for um our insurance
 
03:22:54.229 --> 03:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
coverage in this Pro product um why
 
03:22:56.950 --> 03:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
would it not be make more sense for
 
03:22:59.469 --> 03:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
individual members to to participate in
 
03:23:03.710 --> 03:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:06.790 --> 03:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
to to ask that question because um we
 
03:23:09.030 --> 03:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's not our mod it's not that that
 
03:23:12.269 --> 03:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
would be my only thought there okay yeah
 
03:23:15.670 --> 03:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so one of us will one you take yeah
 
03:23:17.150 --> 03:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if this fully addresses
 
03:23:19.349 --> 03:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
that question um other than this is the
 
03:23:21.990 --> 03:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
model that we uh kind of offer to other
 
03:23:24.590 --> 03:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
agencies and so this cost allocation
 
03:23:26.670 --> 03:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
formula is is something that all other
 
03:23:29.590 --> 03:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
agencies agree to for
 
03:23:33.189 --> 03:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
services um thank you I um I appreciate
 
03:23:35.229 --> 03:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
the answer
 
03:23:38.550 --> 03:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
um with respect we are not other
 
03:23:41.910 --> 03:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
agencies um we are we're a little bit
 
03:23:45.030 --> 03:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
different I think as rep c pointed out
 
03:23:48.269 --> 03:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
we're we're not hired um we're elected
 
03:23:49.790 --> 03:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
um which is a little different than your
 
03:23:54.030 --> 03:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
State Police example um we also have a
 
03:23:55.990 --> 03:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
section in this
 
03:24:00.150 --> 03:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh a section of uh Group Insurance that
 
03:24:02.630 --> 03:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
mentions and I'll quote it uh
 
03:24:04.429 --> 03:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
participation in the state employees
 
03:24:06.269 --> 03:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
Group insurance plan by a member of the
 
03:24:09.189 --> 03:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
general court shall not be considered by
 
03:24:11.750 --> 03:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
any judicial administrative executive of
 
03:24:14.269 --> 03:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
our other body has evidence that a
 
03:24:15.910 --> 03:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
member of the general court is an
 
03:24:18.150 --> 03:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
employee of the
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
state um that language is missing from
 
03:24:26.110 --> 03:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
this and I'm wondering why that is and
 
03:24:27.670 --> 03:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
and representa Hill thank you very much
 
03:24:29.750 --> 03:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
for for that question uh although we are
 
03:24:31.670 --> 03:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
here in support of this bill and
 
03:24:33.550 --> 03:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
certainly if it's funded we would be
 
03:24:35.630 --> 03:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
open to the configuration that's
 
03:24:37.910 --> 03:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
reported in this bill uh I do think that
 
03:24:39.429 --> 03:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
that's a great question to take back to
 
03:24:40.950 --> 03:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
either the attorneys at the a
 
03:24:42.750 --> 03:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
legislative service who drafted this up
 
03:24:45.229 --> 03:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
at the request of uh we did not draft
 
03:24:47.349 --> 03:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
this legislation or placement uh and I
 
03:24:49.189 --> 03:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to fault the people either
 
03:24:50.830 --> 03:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
but we're just not in a position I think
 
03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
answering the question because I think
 
03:24:53.910 --> 03:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
you do raise a great question in terms
 
03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
of words laid out in the same RSA
 
03:24:58.830 --> 03:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
chapter 14a how does it play in with
 
03:25:01.990 --> 03:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
other uh related sections that Define uh
 
03:25:05.590 --> 03:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
or rather um Pro preclude a legislator
 
03:25:09.070 --> 03:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
as being um um trying to come with the
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
right word uh as an employee and so
 
03:25:13.550 --> 03:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
there's an inconsistency within that
 
03:25:14.710 --> 03:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
chapter it really does need to be
 
03:25:16.870 --> 03:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
reconciled in in this bill as well and I
 
03:25:18.830 --> 03:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
suggest given that your timelines for
 
03:25:20.349 --> 03:25:20.359 align:start position:0%
having and I know they are coming up
 
03:25:22.269 --> 03:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
soon on the 15th for bills going to a
 
03:25:23.550 --> 03:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
second committee but that's a great
 
03:25:26.070 --> 03:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
question that should be resolved and
 
03:25:27.830 --> 03:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
we're just I don't think we're in the
 
03:25:29.389 --> 03:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
best position to answering the question
 
03:25:30.710 --> 03:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
for you but you raise a really good
 
03:25:33.110 --> 03:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
point sir fair enough um I'll go to a
 
03:25:33.120 --> 03:25:33.990 align:start position:0%
point sir fair enough um I'll go to a
different

03:25:33.990 --> 03:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:35.630 align:start position:0%
different
question

03:25:35.630 --> 03:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:25:38.309 --> 03:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
um we've talked
 
03:25:41.150 --> 03:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
it we've talked about the fact that
 
03:25:42.950 --> 03:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:25:46.429 --> 03:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
um or you mentioned the fact that uh
 
03:25:49.429 --> 03:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
this is a three basically a three-hour
 
03:25:52.189 --> 03:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
service um right is that there's three
 
03:25:56.710 --> 03:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
sessions that are available um I'm
 
03:26:00.510 --> 03:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
assuming that um those three hours have
 
03:26:03.110 --> 03:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
to be done would have to be done within
 
03:26:06.469 --> 03:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
the time frame of our two-year
 
03:26:10.189 --> 03:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
service so generally the way that has
 
03:26:12.229 --> 03:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
been um
 
03:26:14.550 --> 03:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
offered is you know three hours within
 
03:26:16.590 --> 03:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year you know beginning
 
03:26:18.910 --> 03:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
whenever the person initially accesses
 
03:26:21.830 --> 03:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
us uh but I can tell you that because of
 
03:26:23.349 --> 03:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
the role that we're in and the the
 
03:26:25.630 --> 03:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
nature of the work there are some times
 
03:26:27.910 --> 03:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
we meeting with somebody three times
 
03:26:30.150 --> 03:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh fully offer the service that
 
03:26:31.630 --> 03:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
they might feel they need or might
 
03:26:34.229 --> 03:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
benefit from and so you know this it
 
03:26:35.790 --> 03:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't shut off at the end
 
03:26:37.750 --> 03:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year it's not it's not
 
03:26:39.870 --> 03:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
monitoring that way we certainly look at
 
03:26:41.870 --> 03:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
that we kind of take that into
 
03:26:43.229 --> 03:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
consideration when we're working with
 
03:26:46.269 --> 03:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
somebody but that it would never be um
 
03:26:48.269 --> 03:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
the end of services because somebody met
 
03:26:51.309 --> 03:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
that 3-hour
 
03:26:55.710 --> 03:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
number can I ask sure to this line um
 
03:26:59.030 --> 03:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
Richard thank you sure um just in the
 
03:27:02.030 --> 03:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
same instance are there times when you
 
03:27:05.750 --> 03:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
also have individuals that you've been
 
03:27:09.030 --> 03:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
able to help in less than three discuss
 
03:27:12.950 --> 03:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
and so it is it's not three is not
 
03:27:15.510 --> 03:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
always the number yes and maybe one
 
03:27:18.510 --> 03:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
conversation that is Bridges and
 
03:27:20.550 --> 03:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
provides the assistance absolutely
 
03:27:23.349 --> 03:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
speaking from personal experience of a I
 
03:27:24.750 --> 03:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
really appreciate you you bringing that
 
03:27:27.349 --> 03:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
in that way yeah so you know it's
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary right and so we want to just
 
03:27:31.550 --> 03:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
be uh present and supportive and we're
 
03:27:33.469 --> 03:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
kind of assessing somebody may call and
 
03:27:34.990 --> 03:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
they have an initial description of
 
03:27:36.510 --> 03:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
areas that they're they're struggling
 
03:27:38.150 --> 03:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
with or they want to look for a resource
 
03:27:39.670 --> 03:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
in you know part of what we're doing is
 
03:27:41.070 --> 03:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the complexity of
 
03:27:43.550 --> 03:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
the situation but at the same time
 
03:27:44.950 --> 03:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes people just need a place to
 
03:27:46.670 --> 03:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
have a conversation with somebody
 
03:27:47.950 --> 03:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
outside of their family or somebody
 
03:27:49.950 --> 03:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
outside of their work group right and so
 
03:27:52.070 --> 03:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
that could be a 15minute conversation we
 
03:27:53.870 --> 03:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
would never shut that down but if they
 
03:27:55.590 --> 03:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
felt like they got what they needed
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
there then that that's it followup uh
 
03:28:03.110 --> 03:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
quick followup uh is a lot of that too
 
03:28:05.469 --> 03:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
is also a reference to
 
03:28:09.189 --> 03:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
resources in terms of EAP my
 
03:28:12.189 --> 03:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
understanding is that is such a
 
03:28:16.830 --> 03:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
large component of the work this is not
 
03:28:21.269 --> 03:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
individual therapy this is such a
 
03:28:21.279 --> 03:28:22.950 align:start position:0%
individual therapy this is such a
reference

03:28:22.950 --> 03:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
reference
 
03:28:26.710 --> 03:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
resource absolutely um program you know
 
03:28:28.229 --> 03:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes dependent on the nature of
 
03:28:29.910 --> 03:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
what the request is we may be Bridging
 
03:28:33.229 --> 03:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
the Gap towards that service uh but you
 
03:28:34.990 --> 03:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
know it really does kind of cover the
 
03:28:37.110 --> 03:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
full ground in terms of what resources
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
we may be providing I mean we have uh
 
03:28:42.309 --> 03:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
continued to bring in new programming
 
03:28:43.349 --> 03:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:28:46.070 --> 03:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
around um preventative kind of
 
03:28:47.830 --> 03:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
approaches employee Wellness mental
 
03:28:49.750 --> 03:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
health and wellness so that we are not
 
03:28:53.030 --> 03:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
kind of seen only as a crisis kind of uh
 
03:28:54.790 --> 03:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
agency access or a crisis when
 
03:28:56.030 --> 03:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
somebody's kind of at the point where
 
03:28:57.630 --> 03:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
they've accessed all their resources or
 
03:28:59.830 --> 03:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
aren't sure where to go but certainly
 
03:29:01.630 --> 03:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
you know while we're not uh telling
 
03:29:03.030 --> 03:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
people what to do we see our role is
 
03:29:04.550 --> 03:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
trying to help figure people figure out
 
03:29:06.550 --> 03:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
what their menu of options are around
 
03:29:08.950 --> 03:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
whatever their concern might be and and
 
03:29:10.590 --> 03:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
chairman Hill I just just to get back to
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
you on your ear ear question about
 
03:29:13.790 --> 03:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
reconciliation with the other sections
 
03:29:15.590 --> 03:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
in there one of the things you may want
 
03:29:17.590 --> 03:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
to consider because it does strike one
 
03:29:18.990 --> 03:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
that the program itself is called
 
03:29:20.990 --> 03:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
employee System Program I'm not here to
 
03:29:22.750 --> 03:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
suggest we change that name because it's
 
03:29:24.870 --> 03:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
been in existence a long time but I do
 
03:29:27.150 --> 03:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
think that if you are going to consider
 
03:29:29.070 --> 03:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
the valuable Services forget about the
 
03:29:31.030 --> 03:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
the cover of what the program's name is
 
03:29:32.750 --> 03:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
but the types of referrals that you
 
03:29:35.469 --> 03:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
could get to support the legislature for
 
03:29:37.150 --> 03:29:37.160 align:start position:0%
all the life issues that they may have
 
03:29:39.429 --> 03:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
to happen to them I think at a minimum
 
03:29:40.870 --> 03:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
you may want to consider putting in a
 
03:29:43.189 --> 03:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
sense that says nothing in this section
 
03:29:45.790 --> 03:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh the new section A7 shall be construed
 
03:29:47.630 --> 03:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
that a legislator is an employee I mean
 
03:29:48.870 --> 03:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
something to that to making it crystal
 
03:29:50.189 --> 03:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
clear because you raised a really good
 
03:29:51.910 --> 03:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
point I think in terms of the confusion
 
03:29:54.070 --> 03:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's caused by the name of the program
 
03:29:55.870 --> 03:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
your functions clearly are as
 
03:29:58.630 --> 03:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
legislators and not as employees and
 
03:30:00.309 --> 03:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
having that distinction made within that
 
03:30:02.510 --> 03:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
section would be particularly helpful
 
03:30:06.349 --> 03:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
thank you last question I think for you
 
03:30:09.630 --> 03:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
um I noticed in the in the brochure that
 
03:30:12.590 --> 03:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
I read or it may have been online that
 
03:30:13.910 --> 03:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
and you've mentioned it a couple of
 
03:30:16.309 --> 03:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
times that the service be goes beyond
 
03:30:18.590 --> 03:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
the state employee but to the family
 
03:30:20.550 --> 03:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
member and then and I think in some
 
03:30:23.630 --> 03:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
cases it may even go beyond that this
 
03:30:25.590 --> 03:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
program was not designed that way or
 
03:30:27.550 --> 03:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
written that way this was designed
 
03:30:30.910 --> 03:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
strictly for the the legislator is that
 
03:30:33.830 --> 03:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
am I accurate in that and why why would
 
03:30:37.670 --> 03:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
that this this only talks to the to the
 
03:30:40.349 --> 03:30:40.359 align:start position:0%
legislator not the not the extended
 
03:30:43.790 --> 03:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
family or or anyone else is that by
 
03:30:47.790 --> 03:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
Design so um I'm I'm not aware of the um
 
03:30:49.870 --> 03:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
is the information brochure that you're
 
03:30:51.229 --> 03:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
referring to but I'm taking you totally
 
03:30:53.389 --> 03:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
at face value that it's some confusion
 
03:30:56.150 --> 03:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
there as well my understanding uh from
 
03:30:57.510 --> 03:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
just even just listening but also
 
03:30:59.309 --> 03:30:59.319 align:start position:0%
working with Mr Lawless over the the
 
03:31:02.269 --> 03:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
past few months over this legislation um
 
03:31:04.910 --> 03:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
is that the same U the same mechanics in
 
03:31:06.469 --> 03:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
terms of who those Services would be
 
03:31:08.870 --> 03:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
provided to whether other family members
 
03:31:11.070 --> 03:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
would apply also to the legislature so
 
03:31:12.550 --> 03:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn it back to him but I
 
03:31:15.070 --> 03:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
think I came close maybe to clarifying
 
03:31:16.389 --> 03:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't just be limited to the
 
03:31:18.710 --> 03:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
individual legislator but would be uh
 
03:31:20.269 --> 03:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
extended just as it would with state
 
03:31:22.030 --> 03:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
employees to the the family members as
 
03:31:23.429 --> 03:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
well but now I'm answering and I
 
03:31:24.870 --> 03:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't because he knows the answer
 
03:31:27.229 --> 03:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm just guessing at it I think you
 
03:31:29.750 --> 03:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
did great yes so uh I believe the
 
03:31:31.349 --> 03:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
language says members of your household
 
03:31:33.469 --> 03:31:33.479 align:start position:0%
but again you know I would just put it
 
03:31:36.429 --> 03:31:36.439 align:start position:0%
out there that um we're not kind of
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
grilling people about that if they call
 
03:31:39.830 --> 03:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
in you know who's your family is who's
 
03:31:41.950 --> 03:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
your family and if somebody reaches out
 
03:31:43.590 --> 03:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
in that context then the resource would
 
03:31:46.030 --> 03:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
be available so absolutely in my mind it
 
03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
was it was always intended this language
 
03:31:50.950 --> 03:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
this uh attempt to partner and offer a
 
03:31:53.150 --> 03:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
resource would apply in the same way
 
03:31:54.750 --> 03:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
members of your household family members
 
03:31:56.550 --> 03:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
could access resources the same way
 
03:31:57.950 --> 03:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
anybody else would be able to who
 
03:32:00.070 --> 03:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
already accesses
 
03:32:02.670 --> 03:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
us and and I think goes back and not
 
03:32:04.710 --> 03:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
that we want to have so much legislative
 
03:32:06.670 --> 03:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
wordsmithing here today but I do think
 
03:32:07.950 --> 03:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
if you want to make it clear in your
 
03:32:09.630 --> 03:32:09.640 align:start position:0%
legislation that it applies to family
 
03:32:11.469 --> 03:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
members of The General coord as well
 
03:32:12.269 --> 03:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
because it wouldn't just be
 
03:32:14.189 --> 03:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
Representatives obviously uh the body
 
03:32:16.070 --> 03:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
across the street as well and sometimes
 
03:32:17.750 --> 03:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
they have cohabitate with you here the
 
03:32:19.950 --> 03:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
Senate um you may want to to have that
 
03:32:22.750 --> 03:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
clarification in the legislation as well
 
03:32:25.070 --> 03:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I I think it goes if I'm
 
03:32:27.150 --> 03:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
hearing you correctly it goes beyond
 
03:32:30.590 --> 03:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
even um family members it's those that
 
03:32:32.790 --> 03:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
live in your
 
03:32:34.950 --> 03:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
household again you know I think that
 
03:32:37.910 --> 03:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
our role is members of your household is
 
03:32:39.950 --> 03:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
you know that that is your family is who
 
03:32:42.229 --> 03:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
your family is and so if you you look at
 
03:32:43.870 --> 03:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
members of your household as family or
 
03:32:45.670 --> 03:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's how it's kind of pursued then we
 
03:32:48.389 --> 03:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
would not say there'd be no barrier to
 
03:32:50.990 --> 03:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
accessing our services how many people
 
03:32:53.910 --> 03:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
do you have that can well that was the
 
03:32:55.910 --> 03:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
first question as I read this how can
 
03:32:55.920 --> 03:32:56.870 align:start position:0%
first question as I read this how can
you

03:32:56.870 --> 03:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:32:59.510 --> 03:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
possibly um I think someone had
 
03:33:01.349 --> 03:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned to us that there was not going
 
03:33:03.670 --> 03:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
to be additional sta I think it's in the
 
03:33:06.870 --> 03:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note not additional staff
 
03:33:10.150 --> 03:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
needed but yet you're able to absorb not
 
03:33:11.830 --> 03:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
just 400
 
03:33:15.870 --> 03:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
25 additional potential people but but
 
03:33:20.070 --> 03:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
now the household members and and uh
 
03:33:22.309 --> 03:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
family members it it it could be in the
 
03:33:24.550 --> 03:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
thousands so how many people are you
 
03:33:28.870 --> 03:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
actually um able to provide yeah
 
03:33:31.070 --> 03:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
services for that's a great question you
 
03:33:33.950 --> 03:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
know we we have seven staff members all
 
03:33:35.910 --> 03:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
together right and we also seven busy
 
03:33:38.550 --> 03:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
staff we're all busy for sure uh we are
 
03:33:40.429 --> 03:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
also in the process of procuring a data
 
03:33:42.630 --> 03:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
manager agement system which you know
 
03:33:44.229 --> 03:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
that will help us kind of see the trends
 
03:33:46.389 --> 03:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
that are emerging and and to streamline
 
03:33:48.910 --> 03:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
our process part of our response to that
 
03:33:51.070 --> 03:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
question is that we have Partnerships in
 
03:33:53.030 --> 03:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
the community places that we can refer
 
03:33:54.590 --> 03:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
resources already developed that are
 
03:33:57.229 --> 03:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
easy to kind of share in those moments
 
03:34:00.189 --> 03:34:00.199 align:start position:0%
and we and we exceed National averages
 
03:34:03.710 --> 03:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
around you know it's never 100% access
 
03:34:05.469 --> 03:34:05.479 align:start position:0%
from a particular Department right and
 
03:34:08.750 --> 03:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
so you know while we exceed national uh
 
03:34:11.510 --> 03:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
percentages around Service delivery um
 
03:34:12.990 --> 03:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
our data management system is going to
 
03:34:14.750 --> 03:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
give us a better handle on truly how
 
03:34:16.550 --> 03:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
many people have access to US percentage
 
03:34:18.790 --> 03:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
wise in these different areas and you
 
03:34:20.790 --> 03:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
know as far as I'm concerned with the
 
03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
program um creating a merging program
 
03:34:25.030 --> 03:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
and meeting the needs that are there we
 
03:34:27.030 --> 03:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
have the capacity you know and if if
 
03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's something that as we think about
 
03:34:30.990 --> 03:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
our service delivery model as we move
 
03:34:32.950 --> 03:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
forward from all departments and if it
 
03:34:34.630 --> 03:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
gets to a point where that's not true
 
03:34:35.990 --> 03:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
then we'll explore that when we get
 
03:34:37.710 --> 03:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
there but for now we have the ability to
 
03:34:40.950 --> 03:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
do that and and rep Hill even though New
 
03:34:42.429 --> 03:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is honored with having at
 
03:34:43.830 --> 03:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
least to my knowledge in within the
 
03:34:45.590 --> 03:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
United States the largest legislature
 
03:34:48.150 --> 03:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
per population um that if you think
 
03:34:49.950 --> 03:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
about it in perspective and I agree with
 
03:34:51.469 --> 03:34:51.479 align:start position:0%
you that proportionately we can't get
 
03:34:53.910 --> 03:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
the exact number because we do know 424
 
03:34:55.710 --> 03:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
is the fixed number for you folks but
 
03:34:57.950 --> 03:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily a fixed number we
 
03:35:00.150 --> 03:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
can certainly um you know project what
 
03:35:01.950 --> 03:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
those may be for household members but
 
03:35:03.870 --> 03:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
when you put that in comparison with I
 
03:35:05.349 --> 03:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
think and I'm going to look to Michael
 
03:35:06.349 --> 03:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
because I know it's at least around
 
03:35:08.670 --> 03:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
10,000 state employees it is a smaller
 
03:35:10.030 --> 03:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
percentage of the service population
 
03:35:11.590 --> 03:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
that they already serving but it it's a
 
03:35:13.910 --> 03:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
very thoughtful question on your part um
 
03:35:15.590 --> 03:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of what impact that would have
 
03:35:17.510 --> 03:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
but I think proportionally we're already
 
03:35:19.990 --> 03:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
serving a very significant population
 
03:35:22.429 --> 03:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
currently so hopefully that's a helpful
 
03:35:25.389 --> 03:35:25.399 align:start position:0%
perspective thank you representative M
 
03:35:28.229 --> 03:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
Carter thank you Mr chair uh thanks for
 
03:35:29.510 --> 03:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
03:35:31.870 --> 03:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
question what is the difference between
 
03:35:34.429 --> 03:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
the employee assistance program that
 
03:35:36.550 --> 03:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
would it obviously has a fiscal note
 
03:35:40.990 --> 03:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
attached to us in the free 211 service
 
03:35:44.309 --> 03:35:44.319 align:start position:0%
that uh is available that I've already
 
03:35:46.590 --> 03:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
used and it was very helpful oh that's
 
03:35:48.269 --> 03:35:48.279 align:start position:0%
great that's a great question I'm glad
 
03:35:50.309 --> 03:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
to hear can we please make sure this
 
03:35:52.389 --> 03:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
YouTube Channel video we can place that
 
03:35:54.550 --> 03:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
because that's really great um feedback
 
03:35:57.550 --> 03:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
around the two11 services that we have
 
03:35:59.269 --> 03:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of getting people getting
 
03:36:00.910 --> 03:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
access to Services here through it's
 
03:36:02.189 --> 03:36:02.199 align:start position:0%
called service link is the other name
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
for the 211 so thank you for that
 
03:36:06.510 --> 03:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
commentary the YouTube channel is taken
 
03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
care of we got that yeah so so what I
 
03:36:11.389 --> 03:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
would say there is that there are a
 
03:36:13.550 --> 03:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
number of resources available to to
 
03:36:16.189 --> 03:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
folks already and so sometimes we may be
 
03:36:18.110 --> 03:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
simply connecting them with resources
 
03:36:20.070 --> 03:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
like that uh depending on what the ask
 
03:36:22.229 --> 03:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
is but generally even if there's a
 
03:36:23.630 --> 03:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
service that might be offered through
 
03:36:26.269 --> 03:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
say 211 you know for instance Financial
 
03:36:29.110 --> 03:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
concerns right you could call 211 and uh
 
03:36:30.389 --> 03:36:30.399 align:start position:0%
they would probably point you toward
 
03:36:32.510 --> 03:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
your town and maybe even some financial
 
03:36:34.750 --> 03:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
resources available there we've we've
 
03:36:37.590 --> 03:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
worked with referred uh people to um
 
03:36:39.990 --> 03:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
Green Path debt management programs debt
 
03:36:42.510 --> 03:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
consolidation programs uh the Federal
 
03:36:44.469 --> 03:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
Credit Unions often have a great
 
03:36:46.990 --> 03:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
resources internally and so what I would
 
03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
say is we have a knowledge base around
 
03:36:51.229 --> 03:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
resources in particular areas that may
 
03:36:53.750 --> 03:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
go deeper than other resources and they
 
03:36:55.830 --> 03:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
can be complimentary to those resources
 
03:36:57.469 --> 03:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
the other piece that I would say is even
 
03:36:59.630 --> 03:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
those Standalone resources that are are
 
03:37:01.950 --> 03:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
kind of being mentioned uh they may not
 
03:37:05.510 --> 03:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
have as a robust kind of um menu of
 
03:37:07.790 --> 03:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
resources that we would be helping folks
 
03:37:07.800 --> 03:37:09.389 align:start position:0%
resources that we would be helping folks
connect

03:37:09.389 --> 03:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
connect
 
03:37:12.510 --> 03:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
with so I lied my last question is going
 
03:37:15.990 --> 03:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
to be channeling our former colleague uh
 
03:37:18.189 --> 03:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
representative Neil
 
03:37:20.790 --> 03:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
Kirk where is the language in this
 
03:37:22.910 --> 03:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
section that deals with the security of
 
03:37:26.590 --> 03:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
the information of the U of the
 
03:37:29.630 --> 03:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
participant those that go to um seek
 
03:37:29.640 --> 03:37:30.990 align:start position:0%
participant those that go to um seek
your

03:37:30.990 --> 03:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:37:33.189 --> 03:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
services and being that I saw the
 
03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
honorable one just yesterday testifying
 
03:37:36.590 --> 03:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
in bills we are always very
 
03:37:38.630 --> 03:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
conscientious of protecting individual
 
03:37:40.510 --> 03:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
um personal information but alter turn
 
03:37:42.910 --> 03:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
it over to Mr laws how we currently not
 
03:37:44.990 --> 03:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
only maintain confidentiality from a
 
03:37:46.990 --> 03:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
statutory perspective meaning the
 
03:37:49.189 --> 03:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
information he has is protected under
 
03:37:51.510 --> 03:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
what he he used attorney client I would
 
03:37:52.990 --> 03:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
also say pretty much similar to
 
03:37:54.429 --> 03:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
standards that we would see in terms of
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
clinicians doctors in Hippa in terms of
 
03:37:58.630 --> 03:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
those kind of protections but in terms
 
03:38:00.510 --> 03:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
of security protection of information
 
03:38:02.469 --> 03:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
within our agency we certainly have a
 
03:38:04.189 --> 03:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
very robust Safeguard in terms of that
 
03:38:05.910 --> 03:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
information saved but I'm going to turn
 
03:38:07.150 --> 03:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
it over to this gentleman because he
 
03:38:09.910 --> 03:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
deals with it on a daily basis yes so
 
03:38:12.110 --> 03:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
the the safeguards are you know of the
 
03:38:14.309 --> 03:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
utmost importance and so that's part of
 
03:38:16.790 --> 03:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
that discussion around information that
 
03:38:19.349 --> 03:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh we are privy to never leaves our
 
03:38:21.189 --> 03:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
building you know as it's kind of
 
03:38:23.750 --> 03:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
currently constituted now these are EAP
 
03:38:25.670 --> 03:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
staff that are held to these standards
 
03:38:28.510 --> 03:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
uh including myself around Hippa and 42
 
03:38:31.670 --> 03:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
CFR and when it comes to even uh
 
03:38:33.950 --> 03:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
capturing information about who who
 
03:38:36.150 --> 03:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
we're working within that moment it uh
 
03:38:37.469 --> 03:38:37.479 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're providing the
 
03:38:40.110 --> 03:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
best resource available to that person
 
03:38:42.150 --> 03:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh there you know the The Limited
 
03:38:43.630 --> 03:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
information that's taken down that never
 
03:38:45.389 --> 03:38:45.399 align:start position:0%
gets into any kind of file like a
 
03:38:47.550 --> 03:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
personnel file we have our own process
 
03:38:49.510 --> 03:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
internally and at the minimum it it
 
03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
would be uh non-identifiable information
 
03:38:54.870 --> 03:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
in in a space like that to speak to the
 
03:38:57.150 --> 03:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
fact that uh the person was made aware
 
03:38:58.349 --> 03:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
of the limits of
 
03:39:00.670 --> 03:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and from there it's very
 
03:39:02.870 --> 03:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
limited to maybe met with client or you
 
03:39:05.389 --> 03:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
know provided a resource so there's no
 
03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
deep language around the actual uh
 
03:39:09.590 --> 03:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
individual who's accessing our services
 
03:39:11.990 --> 03:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
and at this Point currently it stays in
 
03:39:14.630 --> 03:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
our location behind minimum of two
 
03:39:16.469 --> 03:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
locked doors as required by Hippa and
 
03:39:16.479 --> 03:39:19.349 align:start position:0%
locked doors as required by Hippa and
42cfr

03:39:19.349 --> 03:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:23.150 --> 03:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
okay anything else from anyone seeing
 
03:39:25.030 --> 03:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
none thank you for your help thank you
 
03:39:25.040 --> 03:39:25.790 align:start position:0%

you I have no other pink cards um
 
03:39:32.670 --> 03:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
although I see pink cards are coming
 
03:39:32.680 --> 03:39:35.910 align:start position:0%
although I see pink cards are coming
different

03:39:35.910 --> 03:39:35.920 align:start position:0%

1363 just a couple minutes and we'll
 
03:39:51.750 --> 03:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
start up
 
03:39:53.950 --> 03:39:53.960 align:start position:0%

1,000 I think is next on our sheet
right

03:40:09.150 --> 03:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:09.160 --> 03:40:59.710 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:40:59.710 --> 03:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:02.349 --> 03:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
I'll open the hearing on House Bill 1000
 
03:41:04.950 --> 03:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
recognize the prime sponsor honorable
 
03:41:07.630 --> 03:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
Marjorie Smith welcome to legislative
 
03:41:09.710 --> 03:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you very much I'm
 
03:41:12.429 --> 03:41:12.439 align:start position:0%
delighted to be here and I love to be in
 
03:41:15.510 --> 03:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
the small room it reminds me of the old
 
03:41:19.870 --> 03:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
days um uh Mr chair and committee
 
03:41:23.070 --> 03:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
members I am really quite honored to
 
03:41:25.550 --> 03:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill 1000 relative to
 
03:41:28.349 --> 03:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
classifying the Hampshire legislator
 
03:41:33.590 --> 03:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
Services as public service for certain
 
03:41:36.790 --> 03:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
federal purposes the very first thing I
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
want to say in honor of my long
 
03:41:42.590 --> 03:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
relationship with um Neil Kirk and my
 
03:41:45.750 --> 03:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
service on the uh finance committee is
 
03:41:49.710 --> 03:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
that there is no State money involved
 
03:41:52.510 --> 03:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note it has nothing to
 
03:41:55.750 --> 03:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
do with State money and that should
 
03:41:59.269 --> 03:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
cause you at least some breath of
 
03:42:03.790 --> 03:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
release this is a public service loan
 
03:42:06.870 --> 03:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
forgiveness program it was created in
 
03:42:11.189 --> 03:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
the Year 2007 under the GE W Bush
 
03:42:13.630 --> 03:42:13.640 align:start position:0%
Administration as an incentive to get
 
03:42:17.269 --> 03:42:17.279 align:start position:0%
young people to enter into public
 
03:42:22.950 --> 03:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
service and here it is 17 years later
 
03:42:25.429 --> 03:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
and we see even more clearly how
 
03:42:28.710 --> 03:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
important it is for us to get young
 
03:42:31.590 --> 03:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
people involved in public service they
 
03:42:34.870 --> 03:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
are going to be determining the future
 
03:42:37.229 --> 03:42:37.239 align:start position:0%
of the state and of this country and we
 
03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
need them um when I went to college
 
03:42:43.870 --> 03:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
College my total uh bill for tuition
 
03:42:49.550 --> 03:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
room and board for a year was
 
03:42:52.070 --> 03:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
$1700 and that was in a private college
 
03:42:55.710 --> 03:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
that wasn't in a public university um
 
03:42:59.070 --> 03:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
adjusted for you know today's
 
03:43:03.630 --> 03:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
uh rate that would be the equivalent of
 
03:43:06.750 --> 03:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
$117,000 you find me somebody who is
 
03:43:10.269 --> 03:43:10.279 align:start position:0%
faced with a tuition bill today
 
03:43:12.990 --> 03:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
full-time that's a tuition room on board
 
03:43:13.000 --> 03:43:14.830 align:start position:0%
full-time that's a tuition room on board
that's

03:43:14.830 --> 03:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:43:18.149 --> 03:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
$177,000 getting educated is very
 
03:43:20.030 --> 03:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
important if we're going to have a a
 
03:43:23.429 --> 03:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
future small D democracy and it costs a
 
03:43:28.990 --> 03:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
lot of money this program applies only
 
03:43:31.630 --> 03:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
to federal student
 
03:43:35.630 --> 03:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
loans and it's not to say well you've
 
03:43:37.429 --> 03:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
taken out a loan and now you shouldn't
 
03:43:39.269 --> 03:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
take the responsibility for paying off
 
03:43:41.469 --> 03:43:41.479 align:start position:0%
the loan you you are not eligible until
 
03:43:44.510 --> 03:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
you have made
 
03:43:50.110 --> 03:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
120 payments that's 10 years of payments
 
03:43:53.309 --> 03:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
and payments you know fulfilling your
 
03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
your full obligation and it's only
 
03:44:00.750 --> 03:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
then that um you would be eligible for
 
03:44:04.269 --> 03:44:04.279 align:start position:0%
this program and it is not a question of
 
03:44:08.510 --> 03:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
being a state or federal employee it's a
 
03:44:12.910 --> 03:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
question of working in federal state
 
03:44:17.070 --> 03:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
local government US Government any level
 
03:44:20.950 --> 03:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
nonprofit but all in terms of Public
 
03:44:24.189 --> 03:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
Service it's it's acknowledging public
 
03:44:27.710 --> 03:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
service and it's providing some small
 
03:44:30.590 --> 03:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
relatively small incentive um we all got
 
03:44:35.590 --> 03:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
our W2 forms this week um and um you
 
03:44:38.110 --> 03:44:38.120 align:start position:0%
know they say we get paid $200 of course
 
03:44:40.710 --> 03:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
we don't we get $183 because they take
 
03:44:45.030 --> 03:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
out for um Social Security Medicare
 
03:44:48.870 --> 03:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
whatever it is Medicare um but if you
 
03:44:51.309 --> 03:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
look at the form the
 
03:44:53.950 --> 03:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
number that's on there your employment
 
03:44:57.790 --> 03:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
identification number is the state and
 
03:45:00.670 --> 03:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
it's the state that issues those forms
 
03:45:03.910 --> 03:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
so that even here we recognize that
 
03:45:05.630 --> 03:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
those of us who are working because of
 
03:45:07.229 --> 03:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
our commitment we're not working for the
 
03:45:10.189 --> 03:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
money we're acknowledged by the State
 
03:45:12.389 --> 03:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
and by the federal government in terms
 
03:45:14.870 --> 03:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
of that great
 
03:45:19.870 --> 03:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
$200 um I'm not going to go on anymore
 
03:45:24.070 --> 03:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
except to say that I don't I'm not going
 
03:45:26.790 --> 03:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
to get compensation under this nor are
 
03:45:29.110 --> 03:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
my children nor are my
 
03:45:31.510 --> 03:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
grandchildren I am committed to this
 
03:45:34.790 --> 03:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
program not for any personal benefit but
 
03:45:37.750 --> 03:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
for a benefit for all of society in that
 
03:45:40.550 --> 03:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
this is a way with without the state
 
03:45:42.910 --> 03:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
having to come up with one
 
03:45:48.110 --> 03:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
dime to make it possible for us to be
 
03:45:51.030 --> 03:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
more welcoming to the young people who
 
03:45:54.030 --> 03:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
have stepped up to the plate and
 
03:45:57.550 --> 03:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
cooperated with the concept of public
 
03:45:59.950 --> 03:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
service and the value of public service
 
03:46:02.630 --> 03:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
so I hope you will find your way to say
 
03:46:05.710 --> 03:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
yes and I think there'll be a number of
 
03:46:08.269 --> 03:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
people behind me who will be happy to
 
03:46:12.309 --> 03:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
answer any technical questions and you'd
 
03:46:14.630 --> 03:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
rather hear from them than from
 
03:46:18.389 --> 03:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
me thank you uh no matter how inaccurate
 
03:46:22.269 --> 03:46:22.279 align:start position:0%
that is um are there any
 
03:46:25.070 --> 03:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none um you're off the
 
03:46:27.950 --> 03:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
hook and well you know I've been doing
 
03:46:30.149 --> 03:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
this for a few years Mr chairman so I'm
 
03:46:32.269 --> 03:46:32.279 align:start position:0%
kind of used to it you've been on but
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm really very pleased I have one
 
03:46:36.910 --> 03:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
question for you oh good sure so um our
 
03:46:40.229 --> 03:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
researcher did um some background
 
03:46:43.950 --> 03:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
from this the program itself uhhuh
 
03:46:47.030 --> 03:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
um and and it comes back to say
 
03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
therefore to be eligible for the program
 
03:46:52.750 --> 03:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
the borrower must be a qualified
 
03:46:56.309 --> 03:46:56.319 align:start position:0%

03:46:58.229 --> 03:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
for the requisite time
 
03:47:01.590 --> 03:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
period and they list a government
 
03:47:05.870 --> 03:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
employer is quote any us-based
 
03:47:09.870 --> 03:47:09.880 align:start position:0%

03:47:49.550 --> 03:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
this I'm I'm sorry I should be I
 
03:47:51.429 --> 03:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be laughing I should be
 
03:47:55.790 --> 03:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
serious the members of Congress um are
 
03:47:58.030 --> 03:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
eligible for all kinds of benefits that
 
03:48:00.189 --> 03:48:00.199 align:start position:0%
no one else in this country is eligible
 
03:48:03.030 --> 03:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
for they fall into special categories in
 
03:48:05.630 --> 03:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
terms of the health insurance and and
 
03:48:08.429 --> 03:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
um they are not they are not one of the
 
03:48:15.710 --> 03:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
huddled masses that we're talking about
 
03:48:20.870 --> 03:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
now it also says that um uh partisan
 
03:48:23.630 --> 03:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
political organizations are not
 
03:48:26.429 --> 03:48:26.439 align:start position:0%
eligible and that is true I mean the
 
03:48:28.510 --> 03:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
Republican National Committee you're
 
03:48:30.030 --> 03:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
aring for the Republican National
 
03:48:32.269 --> 03:48:32.279 align:start position:0%
Committee or let's say the Democratic
 
03:48:35.550 --> 03:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
National Committee for example um or
 
03:48:38.070 --> 03:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
working for them in the state you
 
03:48:40.870 --> 03:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be eligible in this but that's
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
not who elected me or who elected you we
 
03:48:47.950 --> 03:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
were elected by people and I don't know
 
03:48:50.830 --> 03:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
about you Mr chair but I know I
 
03:48:53.910 --> 03:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
represent all the citizens of Durham I
 
03:48:56.830 --> 03:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
don't represent a political party this
 
03:48:56.840 --> 03:48:57.870 align:start position:0%
don't represent a political party this
is

03:48:57.870 --> 03:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
not um our role here is not as employees
 
03:49:07.349 --> 03:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
of a political of a partisan political
 
03:49:09.070 --> 03:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
system and the more we remember that the
 
03:49:13.389 --> 03:49:13.399 align:start position:0%
better off we'd all be thank you thank
 
03:49:17.189 --> 03:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
you uh yet representative
 
03:49:20.429 --> 03:49:20.439 align:start position:0%
shott I just was wondering if uh you're
 
03:49:22.590 --> 03:49:22.600 align:start position:0%
a legislator and you decide to go to
 
03:49:24.790 --> 03:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
college and you stay as a legislator for
 
03:49:29.349 --> 03:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
10 years would you get it work the same
 
03:49:33.349 --> 03:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
way I'm I'm afraid you have to have paid
 
03:49:36.070 --> 03:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
you have to have borrowed the money to
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
be educated and
 
03:49:43.790 --> 03:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
paid 120 times for 10 years to have paid
 
03:49:49.030 --> 03:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
the um the loan and only then would you
 
03:49:49.040 --> 03:49:49.950 align:start position:0%
the um the loan and only then would you
be

03:49:49.950 --> 03:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:49:53.710 --> 03:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
considered for this program
 
03:49:57.429 --> 03:49:57.439 align:start position:0%
so I quick does that does that help it
 
03:49:59.309 --> 03:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
would be probably you you'd have to pay
 
03:50:00.790 --> 03:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
for 10 years and you have to serve
 
03:50:04.229 --> 03:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:07.990 --> 03:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
years well so you be serving 20 years
 
03:50:11.389 --> 03:50:11.399 align:start position:0%
representable can you help us a little
 
03:50:15.189 --> 03:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
it it says former as well so to the way
 
03:50:17.630 --> 03:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
I read it is that former legislators
 
03:50:19.349 --> 03:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
would also be as long as they paid up
 
03:50:21.910 --> 03:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
into it so you would be able to serve a
 
03:50:25.030 --> 03:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
term and then you would qualify if then
 
03:50:27.149 --> 03:50:27.159 align:start position:0%
you reached but right in the bill it
 
03:50:31.110 --> 03:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
says former as well okay thank you thank
 
03:50:33.269 --> 03:50:33.279 align:start position:0%
you but you have to have the 10 years of
 
03:50:35.870 --> 03:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
public service representative sellers
 
03:50:38.550 --> 03:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
now thank you Mr chair so you just uh
 
03:50:41.070 --> 03:50:41.080 align:start position:0%
brought up a good point this not just
 
03:50:43.910 --> 03:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
includes from today forward but would it
 
03:50:46.990 --> 03:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
include all legislators that have ever
 
03:50:49.469 --> 03:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
served he ain't going
 
03:50:52.030 --> 03:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
forward if they
 
03:50:56.030 --> 03:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
had if they I think I would like either
 
03:50:56.040 --> 03:50:56.990 align:start position:0%
had if they I think I would like either
the

03:50:56.990 --> 03:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:50:59.269 --> 03:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
clerk or
 
03:51:02.750 --> 03:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
um someone else who could professionally
 
03:51:05.469 --> 03:51:05.479 align:start position:0%
answer that I will just say to you by
 
03:51:08.389 --> 03:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
the way that the commissioner of
 
03:51:08.399 --> 03:51:09.830 align:start position:0%
the way that the commissioner of
administration

03:51:09.830 --> 03:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
administration
 
03:51:13.229 --> 03:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner Arling has has uh has
 
03:51:15.189 --> 03:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
told me and told me that I could say
 
03:51:17.030 --> 03:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
that he has absolutely no problem with
 
03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
this there is no
 
03:51:20.640 --> 03:51:22.790 align:start position:0%
this there is no
State

03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
State
 
03:51:25.790 --> 03:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
financial input of this no State
 
03:51:28.670 --> 03:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
financial input all it is is following
 
03:51:31.510 --> 03:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
the federal law and the federal
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
guidelines all that has to happen is
 
03:51:36.229 --> 03:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
someone has to
 
03:51:41.110 --> 03:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
verify your 10 years of public service
 
03:51:44.950 --> 03:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
and it might be that for you it's two
 
03:51:48.349 --> 03:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
years of working in the legislature and
 
03:51:53.670 --> 03:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
six years of um working in a not from
 
03:51:57.189 --> 03:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
not for-profit organization that is
 
03:51:59.750 --> 03:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
considered public service and how many
 
03:52:02.670 --> 03:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
did I get up to eight and two years in
 
03:52:05.189 --> 03:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
something else so it wouldn't have to be
 
03:52:08.750 --> 03:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
10 years here in in the legislature all
 
03:52:11.910 --> 03:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
this does is say that for the time that
 
03:52:13.790 --> 03:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
you have been in the
 
03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
legislature um that service would count
 
03:52:20.830 --> 03:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
as public as public service under the
 
03:52:25.149 --> 03:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
federal law and I can't imagine anything
 
03:52:27.070 --> 03:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
that's more public service because we're
 
03:52:28.870 --> 03:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
not doing it for the
 
03:52:34.990 --> 03:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:38.349 --> 03:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
you second pink card we have uh is
 
03:52:41.030 --> 03:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative of Ellen Reed who ask for
 
03:52:43.750 --> 03:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
five minutes and supports the
 
03:52:46.990 --> 03:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm a co-sponsor thank you Mr
 
03:52:49.990 --> 03:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you honorable members uh
 
03:52:51.870 --> 03:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
the question that was just asked I'm
 
03:52:53.950 --> 03:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
going to clarify because the reason I am
 
03:52:55.550 --> 03:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
here testifying is because I am very
 
03:52:57.510 --> 03:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with this process because I
 
03:52:59.590 --> 03:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
have worked in nonprofits and in
 
03:53:01.630 --> 03:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
government um organizations which I'll
 
03:53:04.269 --> 03:53:04.279 align:start position:0%
testify to on another bill later um in
 
03:53:06.189 --> 03:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
order to qualify for this program you
 
03:53:09.670 --> 03:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
have to have made 120 on time payments
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
while in public service post 2007 so
 
03:53:17.349 --> 03:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
people who served before 2007 wouldn't
 
03:53:19.269 --> 03:53:19.279 align:start position:0%
qualify if you served but weren't making
 
03:53:21.429 --> 03:53:21.439 align:start position:0%
payments or hadn't yet borrowed the
 
03:53:23.389 --> 03:53:23.399 align:start position:0%
money you wouldn't qualify you have to
 
03:53:24.990 --> 03:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
be making payments while you're in
 
03:53:25.000 --> 03:53:26.070 align:start position:0%
be making payments while you're in
public

03:53:26.070 --> 03:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:53:30.149 --> 03:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
service great okay so to continue on yes
 
03:53:32.389 --> 03:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
you can mix and match any of those
 
03:53:35.149 --> 03:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
nonprofit Public Service uh things there
 
03:53:36.309 --> 03:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
are many rules regarding which
 
03:53:39.110 --> 03:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
organizations count as public service
 
03:53:42.349 --> 03:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
yes um you can't work for a political
 
03:53:45.670 --> 03:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
organization we are not political when
 
03:53:48.110 --> 03:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
we are here we are serving the public we
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
are public servants that is the
 
03:53:52.429 --> 03:53:52.439 align:start position:0%
definition of our role here we may
 
03:53:54.229 --> 03:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
personally adhere to to partisan
 
03:53:56.950 --> 03:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
politics we may campaign on that and
 
03:53:58.189 --> 03:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
that's Exempted of course if you're
 
03:53:59.990 --> 03:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
working for a campaign but when we're
 
03:54:02.429 --> 03:54:02.439 align:start position:0%
here in our professional capacity we are
 
03:54:02.439 --> 03:54:05.349 align:start position:0%
here in our professional capacity we are
not

03:54:05.349 --> 03:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:08.189 --> 03:54:08.199 align:start position:0%
partisans however Congress Congress
 
03:54:10.349 --> 03:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
passed the law Congress Exempted
 
03:54:12.309 --> 03:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
themselves as they should recuse
 
03:54:13.670 --> 03:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
themselves since this would have
 
03:54:16.269 --> 03:54:16.279 align:start position:0%
actually applied to them much in the
 
03:54:17.790 --> 03:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
same way that it is against the
 
03:54:19.510 --> 03:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution for them to pay themselves
 
03:54:21.149 --> 03:54:21.159 align:start position:0%
but they have to pay if they do a pay
 
03:54:22.429 --> 03:54:22.439 align:start position:0%
increase they have to do it for the
 
03:54:25.550 --> 03:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
future uh legislature they would have
 
03:54:27.469 --> 03:54:27.479 align:start position:0%
qualified under this have they not
 
03:54:29.910 --> 03:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
specifically Exempted themselves they
 
03:54:32.510 --> 03:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
explicitly did not exempt state
 
03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
legislators think about that they went
 
03:54:36.590 --> 03:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
through some federal contractors some
 
03:54:39.950 --> 03:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
State contractors apply or qualify some
 
03:54:41.710 --> 03:54:41.720 align:start position:0%
don't and they get into the details
 
03:54:43.349 --> 03:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
about well if the state doesn't have any
 
03:54:44.750 --> 03:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
other resources and they had to go
 
03:54:46.750 --> 03:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
through a private contractor then those
 
03:54:48.269 --> 03:54:48.279 align:start position:0%
private contractors are considered
 
03:54:49.910 --> 03:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
public service but if they had other
 
03:54:51.469 --> 03:54:51.479 align:start position:0%
resources so they got really in the
 
03:54:54.269 --> 03:54:54.279 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty ex uh recused themselves
 
03:54:58.189 --> 03:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
from it but specifically did not exempt
 
03:55:00.750 --> 03:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
state legislators perhaps because some
 
03:55:02.750 --> 03:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
of them worked in their own State
 
03:55:05.189 --> 03:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
legislates and knew how little they got
 
03:55:06.349 --> 03:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
paid and how much they would have
 
03:55:08.030 --> 03:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
appreciated help with their public
 
03:55:08.040 --> 03:55:09.510 align:start position:0%
appreciated help with their public
service

03:55:09.510 --> 03:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:55:12.510 --> 03:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
um the form that is received by the
 
03:55:15.149 --> 03:55:15.159 align:start position:0%
federal government from the employer in
 
03:55:17.269 --> 03:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
this case the state it's very short it's
 
03:55:19.750 --> 03:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
only six lines it basically says the
 
03:55:21.630 --> 03:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
name and address of the the organization
 
03:55:23.070 --> 03:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
in this case it would be the state that
 
03:55:24.630 --> 03:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
the start and end dates of the public
 
03:55:28.389 --> 03:55:28.399 align:start position:0%
service and the employer identification
 
03:55:30.750 --> 03:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
number the employer identification
 
03:55:33.950 --> 03:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
number on the W2 that we just all got so
 
03:55:36.830 --> 03:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
by the way I understand that we and I
 
03:55:38.110 --> 03:55:38.120 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the philosophical
 
03:55:39.990 --> 03:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
argument that we aren't employees of the
 
03:55:42.229 --> 03:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
state on a state level because what
 
03:55:43.990 --> 03:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying is a sentiment I fully
 
03:55:45.910 --> 03:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
agree with that we aren't here on a
 
03:55:49.030 --> 03:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
transactional basis we aren't here to do
 
03:55:50.950 --> 03:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
work because we're getting paid to do it
 
03:55:52.510 --> 03:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
and I fully agree with that we're here
 
03:55:55.349 --> 03:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
for a much more sacred Duty however for
 
03:55:57.429 --> 03:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
the federal government there is no
 
03:55:58.830 --> 03:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
situation where the federal government
 
03:56:00.990 --> 03:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
issues a W2 or I rather should say
 
03:56:03.269 --> 03:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
requires a W2 to be issued unless you're
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
an employee so federal government
 
03:56:07.030 --> 03:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
purposes regardless of our philosophical
 
03:56:09.269 --> 03:56:09.279 align:start position:0%
agreement federal government considers
 
03:56:13.229 --> 03:56:13.239 align:start position:0%
us employees we get a W2 we get federal
 
03:56:16.189 --> 03:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
taxes I should say the Social Security
 
03:56:17.910 --> 03:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
and Medicare taken out the reason we
 
03:56:19.990 --> 03:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
don't get Federal Income T tax taken out
 
03:56:22.550 --> 03:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
is because it's set at $200 which Falls
 
03:56:25.750 --> 03:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
below the tax brackets we make too
 
03:56:30.309 --> 03:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
little to pay federal income tax the Ein
 
03:56:33.670 --> 03:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
employer identification number
 
03:56:37.750 --> 03:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
02600 618 is the same Ein that is issued
 
03:56:39.870 --> 03:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
to every state employee whether you're
 
03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
with the doe or the do or you're a staff
 
03:56:45.790 --> 03:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
person here you all have all of us all
 
03:56:48.429 --> 03:56:48.439 align:start position:0%
10 to 156 I can't remember who what they
 
03:56:51.429 --> 03:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
said in the last bill state employees
 
03:56:54.469 --> 03:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
have this exact same Ein employer
 
03:56:58.070 --> 03:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
identification number $200 is in the
 
03:57:00.070 --> 03:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
federal or sorry the state constitution
 
03:57:02.309 --> 03:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
because that's our salary it's our
 
03:57:04.269 --> 03:57:04.279 align:start position:0%
salary in the Constitution the reason
 
03:57:05.550 --> 03:57:05.560 align:start position:0%
we're no longer considered like an
 
03:57:07.630 --> 03:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
employee is because now our salary has
 
03:57:09.469 --> 03:57:09.479 align:start position:0%
fallen below what we consider minimum
 
03:57:11.630 --> 03:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
wage but that doesn't change the fact
 
03:57:13.229 --> 03:57:13.239 align:start position:0%
that that was always our salary in the
 
03:57:15.990 --> 03:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution and at that time yes when
 
03:57:19.510 --> 03:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
you uh adjust for CPI it's still you
 
03:57:21.670 --> 03:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
know below livable wage but at the time
 
03:57:23.990 --> 03:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
housing was so widely available that it
 
03:57:27.630 --> 03:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
was enough to buy a four acres with an
 
03:57:29.110 --> 03:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
improve improved house an improved
 
03:57:30.630 --> 03:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
structure it was enough to buy a farm in
 
03:57:32.149 --> 03:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
other words it was a livable wage it was
 
03:57:34.229 --> 03:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
enough to live off of so we were always
 
03:57:37.870 --> 03:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
intended to be fairly compensated but I
 
03:57:39.630 --> 03:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
I am getting getting farfield because
 
03:57:41.710 --> 03:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
this is not about us being a state
 
03:57:44.110 --> 03:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
employee and I'm going to get to that in
 
03:57:47.550 --> 03:57:47.560 align:start position:0%
fact the language that um DHS suggested
 
03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
on the last bill saying that all these
 
03:57:51.870 --> 03:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
other things you know despite this this
 
03:57:54.389 --> 03:57:54.399 align:start position:0%
is not evidence that we are employees
 
03:57:56.630 --> 03:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's is also
 
03:58:01.189 --> 03:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
here continuing on um so myself and
 
03:58:03.070 --> 03:58:03.080 align:start position:0%
other people when we've applied for our
 
03:58:04.590 --> 03:58:04.600 align:start position:0%
Public service loan forgiveness the
 
03:58:06.149 --> 03:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
accounting office it's the accounting
 
03:58:07.910 --> 03:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
office that has decided to not certify
 
03:58:11.189 --> 03:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
us as full-time employees in public
 
03:58:13.349 --> 03:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
service and the reason I asked
 
03:58:15.189 --> 03:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
specifically for the reasons and I was
 
03:58:17.229 --> 03:58:17.239 align:start position:0%
emailed the reason specifically was
 
03:58:18.870 --> 03:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
because they did not consider that we
 
03:58:20.590 --> 03:58:20.600 align:start position:0%
were hired through the normal hiring
 
03:58:22.229 --> 03:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
process as the chair had mentioned and
 
03:58:25.030 --> 03:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
also uh fired through the normal normal
 
03:58:27.990 --> 03:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
firing process however there are other
 
03:58:30.990 --> 03:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
employees true employees of the state
 
03:58:33.110 --> 03:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
with that same EI in number who are also
 
03:58:36.790 --> 03:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
elected we elect the Secretary of State
 
03:58:39.229 --> 03:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
we elect the state treasurer
 
03:58:43.110 --> 03:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
we elect the clerks of the chambers and
 
03:58:45.229 --> 03:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
they get salary and they have the same
 
03:58:51.149 --> 03:58:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:53.870 --> 03:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
pslf and uh the prime sponsor already
 
03:58:55.750 --> 03:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the commissioner of the
 
03:58:57.510 --> 03:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
03:58:59.510 --> 03:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
has already said he has no reason to
 
03:59:00.750 --> 03:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
oppose the certification of public
 
03:59:03.990 --> 03:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
service for legislators for federal
 
03:59:07.830 --> 03:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
pslf um and I already said that we do
 
03:59:10.990 --> 03:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
say notwithstanding provision of uh RSA
 
03:59:13.950 --> 03:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
14 A6 so in other words we're not
 
03:59:15.269 --> 03:59:15.279 align:start position:0%
employees we're saying we're not
 
03:59:16.750 --> 03:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
employees for the purposes of the state
 
03:59:18.030 --> 03:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
the federal government already thinks
 
03:59:19.309 --> 03:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
we're employees but we're not employees
 
03:59:20.830 --> 03:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
for the purpos of the state we're just
 
03:59:23.990 --> 03:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
accessing benefits just like we have
 
03:59:26.189 --> 03:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
with health insurance we had that law
 
03:59:27.870 --> 03:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
that gave us access to health insurance
 
03:59:32.070 --> 03:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:34.389 --> 03:59:34.399 align:start position:0%
employees that may have cost us a little
 
03:59:36.910 --> 03:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
bit of money by the way potentially a
 
03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
little bit but this costs us nothing and
 
03:59:40.710 --> 03:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
not only does it not cost New Hampshire
 
03:59:42.910 --> 03:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
any money whatsoever but since New
 
03:59:45.950 --> 03:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a federal income tax donor
 
03:59:47.550 --> 03:59:47.560 align:start position:0%
state it means that we'll be getting
 
03:59:49.590 --> 03:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
some of those dollars that are now going
 
03:59:53.110 --> 03:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
to other states back meanwhile the vast
 
03:59:54.630 --> 03:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
majority of States already consider
 
03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
their legislators to be employees so
 
03:59:58.149 --> 03:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
they don't need this type of legislation
 
03:59:59.830 --> 03:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
they're automatically those other state
 
04:00:01.670 --> 04:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
legislators automatically qualify for
 
04:00:05.670 --> 04:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
pslf and get pslf in other states just
 
04:00:07.830 --> 04:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
from the friends I have serving in
 
04:00:10.110 --> 04:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
office in States I know for a fact and
 
04:00:12.830 --> 04:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
have confirmed Texas state employees
 
04:00:14.630 --> 04:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
their legislators are state employees
 
04:00:17.389 --> 04:00:17.399 align:start position:0%
Tennessee Maine Montana Most states
 
04:00:19.469 --> 04:00:19.479 align:start position:0%
consider their state their legislators
 
04:00:22.229 --> 04:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
state employees so they don't need this
 
04:00:24.550 --> 04:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
legislation and here's the thing since
 
04:00:26.630 --> 04:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
we're a donor state that means our tax
 
04:00:28.950 --> 04:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
dollars are going to forgive
 
04:00:31.349 --> 04:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts state legislators in
 
04:00:33.670 --> 04:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
California state legislators why aren't
 
04:00:35.309 --> 04:00:35.319 align:start position:0%
our tax dollars forgiving our state
 
04:00:37.389 --> 04:00:37.399 align:start position:0%
legislators when we desperately need
 
04:00:40.429 --> 04:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
young people in this chamber why why are
 
04:00:42.070 --> 04:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
we why are we donating to California
 
04:00:42.080 --> 04:00:44.429 align:start position:0%
we why are we donating to California
state

04:00:44.429 --> 04:00:44.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:46.870 --> 04:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
legislators the pslf program was
 
04:00:48.469 --> 04:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
designed to incentivize young people to
 
04:00:49.750 --> 04:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
get into public service and that's
 
04:00:53.750 --> 04:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what we need in this state so
 
04:00:55.469 --> 04:00:55.479 align:start position:0%
just simply passing a measure to say yes
 
04:00:57.670 --> 04:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
being a legislator is public service we
 
04:00:59.990 --> 04:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
all know it's public service and help
 
04:01:02.790 --> 04:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
more young people to run for office um
 
04:01:04.710 --> 04:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
will help us
 
04:01:09.550 --> 04:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
now I do want to say that um
 
04:01:11.149 --> 04:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
I think I actually covered all my points
 
04:01:14.309 --> 04:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
Public Service yes we're not so we can
 
04:01:15.590 --> 04:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
just to be very
 
04:01:19.110 --> 04:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
clear we can declare that yes we are
 
04:01:20.790 --> 04:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
full-time public servants the federal
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
government and still say we're not
 
04:01:24.550 --> 04:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
employees on the state level that is
 
04:01:25.990 --> 04:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
possible that's what this bill does and
 
04:01:27.990 --> 04:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take
 
04:01:32.269 --> 04:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um representative
 
04:01:34.830 --> 04:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
cost thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:01:37.910 --> 04:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I don't know
 
04:01:42.630 --> 04:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
any one that considers what we do
 
04:01:46.269 --> 04:01:46.279 align:start position:0%
full-time um can you can you speak to a
 
04:01:48.710 --> 04:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
the full-time versus what I believe we
 
04:01:51.389 --> 04:01:51.399 align:start position:0%
are which is a part-time volunteer thank
 
04:01:52.950 --> 04:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
you so much for the question I actually
 
04:01:55.550 --> 04:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
have a ton of notes on that issue and I
 
04:01:57.910 --> 04:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
didn't want to like expand my testimony
 
04:02:00.189 --> 04:02:00.199 align:start position:0%
by delving into that but I'm now I get
 
04:02:03.550 --> 04:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
to okay so we are salaried right we're
 
04:02:05.870 --> 04:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
not hourly we get $200 for the entire
 
04:02:09.149 --> 04:02:09.159 align:start position:0%
term your salary and your salary for a
 
04:02:11.269 --> 04:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
piece of work again not hourly a piece
 
04:02:13.070 --> 04:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
of work what is that piece of work the
 
04:02:15.349 --> 04:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
piece of work is you are the
 
04:02:18.309 --> 04:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative for your constituents 247
 
04:02:21.269 --> 04:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
365 days a year now if you say is our
 
04:02:23.389 --> 04:02:23.399 align:start position:0%
session work part-time it's absolutely
 
04:02:24.990 --> 04:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
part-time if you say our is our
 
04:02:26.910 --> 04:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
committee work part-time kind of depends
 
04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
what time of the year it is so maybe
 
04:02:30.590 --> 04:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
half the year it could potentially be
 
04:02:32.349 --> 04:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
full-time if you're like me and put 16
 
04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
bills in and are on 59 bills it's pretty
 
04:02:38.510 --> 04:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
pretty darn it's actually overtime um um
 
04:02:40.710 --> 04:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
but in terms of committee work it can be
 
04:02:43.790 --> 04:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
part-time um but in terms of being
 
04:02:46.389 --> 04:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
responsive to your constituents in terms
 
04:02:50.269 --> 04:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
of emails zooms texts that I know I have
 
04:02:53.229 --> 04:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
done way over time and it's all every
 
04:02:57.510 --> 04:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
season every holiday 247 I've taken 11:
 
04:02:59.149 --> 04:02:59.159 align:start position:0%
PM calls from constituents whose
 
04:03:01.030 --> 04:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
electricity was turned off unjustly and
 
04:03:03.670 --> 04:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
I had to go and text the eversource
 
04:03:06.469 --> 04:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
lobbyist and get their electricity
 
04:03:08.830 --> 04:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
turned on in the middle of the night
 
04:03:11.910 --> 04:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:15.389 --> 04:03:15.399 align:start position:0%
247365 now maybe maybe you're not like
 
04:03:17.550 --> 04:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
me maybe you don't put in 16 bills maybe
 
04:03:20.389 --> 04:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't answer calls at 11 p.m
 
04:03:23.110 --> 04:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
and it's up to your boss it's up to your
 
04:03:25.229 --> 04:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
boss the legis the uh the electorate
 
04:03:26.790 --> 04:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
your constituents whether or not they
 
04:03:28.469 --> 04:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
think you have fulfilled that peace meal
 
04:03:30.910 --> 04:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
work that they gave you a salary for did
 
04:03:32.469 --> 04:03:32.479 align:start position:0%
you do the job for the last two years
 
04:03:34.550 --> 04:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
that we hired you to do and if they're
 
04:03:36.429 --> 04:03:36.439 align:start position:0%
happy with your work then they'll keep
 
04:03:38.349 --> 04:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
you employed and if they're not not
 
04:03:40.229 --> 04:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
happy with your work then they'll
 
04:03:42.790 --> 04:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
replace you as they should if you're not
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
actually doing your end of the work but
 
04:03:47.630 --> 04:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
it's salary it's for the fact that we
 
04:03:50.469 --> 04:03:50.479 align:start position:0%
cannot take off if you get pulled over
 
04:03:52.110 --> 04:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
like with a DUI or something you're
 
04:03:53.630 --> 04:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
still a state W and that goes in the
 
04:03:56.269 --> 04:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
news you can't take off our
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility at any point during those
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
two years that is what we're getting
 
04:04:06.149 --> 04:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:09.630 --> 04:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
for any other further
 
04:04:14.590 --> 04:04:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:18.790 --> 04:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
much uh last pin card I have is for our

chairman good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
04:04:30.590 --> 04:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:04:32.750 --> 04:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
Paul Smith Clerk of the house and I am
 
04:04:35.790 --> 04:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
neither in favor nor opposed to this
 
04:04:37.710 --> 04:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
legislation just wanted to provide you
 
04:04:41.309 --> 04:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
with a couple of uh Salient points um
 
04:04:42.830 --> 04:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
I've been asked several times over the
 
04:04:45.630 --> 04:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
last few years uh by current and former
 
04:04:48.910 --> 04:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
members uh about the process uh of
 
04:04:50.670 --> 04:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
certifying their service as public
 
04:04:54.910 --> 04:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
service for the purposes of PC pslf um
 
04:04:57.590 --> 04:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
and in those cases I've uh referred them
 
04:04:59.309 --> 04:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
down to the general court administrative
 
04:05:00.750 --> 04:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
office because they are the folks that
 
04:05:03.510 --> 04:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
handle it for the record uh 20 years
 
04:05:05.870 --> 04:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
after I graduated college last year uh I
 
04:05:09.630 --> 04:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
was the recipient of that PS LF program
 
04:05:12.510 --> 04:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
uh myself where my last $4,500 in loans
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
was forgiven but not after um extensive
 
04:05:18.469 --> 04:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
paperwork uh and and hassles from the
 
04:05:19.990 --> 04:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
federal government which I'm sure
 
04:05:23.670 --> 04:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
surprises you um that being said uh at
 
04:05:25.510 --> 04:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
the request of the sponsors I did reach
 
04:05:27.750 --> 04:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
out to several of my colleagues uh last
 
04:05:30.429 --> 04:05:30.439 align:start position:0%
evening uh to ask specifically about
 
04:05:32.670 --> 04:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
their states because again this is a
 
04:05:35.790 --> 04:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
state decision this is this is a choice
 
04:05:38.269 --> 04:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
of this legislature to make in in terms
 
04:05:40.510 --> 04:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
of whether or not you want to recognize
 
04:05:43.189 --> 04:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
that service for these Federal purposes
 
04:05:47.990 --> 04:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I did hear from uh 13 states um and
 
04:05:50.990 --> 04:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh of that 10 were yes and three were no
 
04:05:52.910 --> 04:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm talking about not in terms of
 
04:05:54.510 --> 04:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
employment I don't want to get into that
 
04:05:56.149 --> 04:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
debate that doesn't involve me that
 
04:05:59.110 --> 04:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
being said for the purposes of the
 
04:06:02.510 --> 04:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
program itself eligibility 10 were in in
 
04:06:05.030 --> 04:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
support and those included Maine Hawaii
 
04:06:07.830 --> 04:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
Vermont Virginia Florida Kansas Al
 
04:06:10.110 --> 04:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
Alabama Washington Minnesota and
 
04:06:12.510 --> 04:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania and the three that were not
 
04:06:14.710 --> 04:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
eligible for the program despite their
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
recognition of of employees is New
 
04:06:19.030 --> 04:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
Mexico Kentucky and
 
04:06:23.309 --> 04:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
Texas um the form itself having filled
 
04:06:26.149 --> 04:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
it out that that we would be filling out
 
04:06:28.870 --> 04:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
if it were our responsibility would
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
would is a small part of the box that
 
04:06:33.710 --> 04:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
literally just says the dates of service
 
04:06:35.790 --> 04:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
um and that is something that could be
 
04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
managed uh very easily my only uh
 
04:06:40.990 --> 04:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
consideration in terms of looking at the
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
bill is on line n where it has the
 
04:06:45.389 --> 04:06:45.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner being the person
 
04:06:46.750 --> 04:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for filling out the
 
04:06:48.910 --> 04:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork uh this is the legislative
 
04:06:50.630 --> 04:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
branch and I would defer to the
 
04:06:53.269 --> 04:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
legislative branch officials namely
 
04:06:55.110 --> 04:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
myself or the general court
 
04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
Administrative Office to be the the
 
04:06:59.030 --> 04:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
persons who are the the record keepers
 
04:07:02.590 --> 04:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
of the branch uh to to file um those
 
04:07:06.550 --> 04:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
paperwork that paperwork if if uh if it
 
04:07:08.870 --> 04:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
is going to be filled out so I just
 
04:07:13.309 --> 04:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to um again mention that this is
 
04:07:14.670 --> 04:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
uh this is something that has been
 
04:07:16.030 --> 04:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
brought to me several times over the
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
last few years um and you know
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
clarification um is is certainly
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
appreciated one way or the other um and
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
I have I'm able to answer any questions
 
04:07:30.590 --> 04:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
you might have thank you Mr clerk uh
 
04:07:33.429 --> 04:07:33.439 align:start position:0%
representative sers thank you m uh Mr
 
04:07:35.630 --> 04:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
chair and maybe you can answer this or
 
04:07:39.389 --> 04:07:39.399 align:start position:0%
not uh is this constitution
 
04:07:41.990 --> 04:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
I don't see that it's not constitutional
 
04:07:45.469 --> 04:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
um it it literally designates for the
 
04:07:48.510 --> 04:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
purposes of a federal program your
 
04:07:51.750 --> 04:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
service as being public service so I I
 
04:07:53.670 --> 04:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
don't see that this has any
 
04:07:56.389 --> 04:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional this is my opinion uh I
 
04:07:59.070 --> 04:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
don't see that it has any constitutional
 
04:08:02.229 --> 04:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
issues so I'll follow up on that um
 
04:08:05.710 --> 04:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
would it require any disclosures
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
um under the current form of our
 
04:08:11.710 --> 04:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
disclosure that's a very good question I
 
04:08:14.070 --> 04:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
would think that
 
04:08:17.830 --> 04:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
um firstly anybody who participates in
 
04:08:20.510 --> 04:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
the pslf program when if their loan is
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
Forgiven they have to report that on
 
04:08:25.870 --> 04:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
their income tax filings uh so uh I'm
 
04:08:27.790 --> 04:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
waiting for my paperwork from last year
 
04:08:29.510 --> 04:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
from the federal government so hopefully
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
they stick to the January 31st deadline
 
04:08:34.389 --> 04:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh of mailing me my form so that I can
 
04:08:36.990 --> 04:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
uh file that uh with the appropriate
 
04:08:37.000 --> 04:08:38.149 align:start position:0%
uh file that uh with the appropriate
paperwork

04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
04:08:40.229 --> 04:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
um in terms
 
04:08:44.590 --> 04:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
of what your your requirements for
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
filing at the beginning of a banum are
 
04:08:50.309 --> 04:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
are your income derived from your
 
04:08:52.429 --> 04:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
profession uh so I'm not I'm not
 
04:08:54.630 --> 04:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
entirely sure that this would be in that
 
04:08:54.640 --> 04:08:56.189 align:start position:0%
entirely sure that this would be in that
same

04:08:56.189 --> 04:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
same
 
04:08:59.590 --> 04:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
vein thank you um further
 
04:08:59.600 --> 04:09:01.790 align:start position:0%
vein thank you um further
questions

04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:09:04.469 --> 04:09:04.479 align:start position:0%
c u thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:09:06.349 --> 04:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question this goes back to the
 
04:09:09.349 --> 04:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
the fulltime parttime thing everyone
 
04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
that I know knows this the politicians
 
04:09:14.910 --> 04:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
here like us side obviously a full-time
 
04:09:17.070 --> 04:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
that's obviously a full-time position
 
04:09:19.630 --> 04:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
but um the legislators here most of them
 
04:09:21.830 --> 04:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
have other jobs and this is a part-time
 
04:09:24.870 --> 04:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
role so how do we Square the full-time
 
04:09:28.030 --> 04:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
Service as a job like I think of things
 
04:09:30.109 --> 04:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
like a maricor or something like that or
 
04:09:32.710 --> 04:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
a teacher there obviously full-time
 
04:09:34.429 --> 04:09:34.439 align:start position:0%
whereas every everything here is known
 
04:09:35.389 --> 04:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:09:38.910 --> 04:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
part-time uh just just want your opinion
 
04:09:40.830 --> 04:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
on the difference between the full and
 
04:09:42.750 --> 04:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
all I'll I'll mention about that is is
 
04:09:46.030 --> 04:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
in that list of uh list of states that I
 
04:09:48.790 --> 04:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned before um only Pennsylvania is
 
04:09:50.469 --> 04:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
considered full-time and they are
 
04:09:52.590 --> 04:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
actually full-time all yearlong
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
legislature um so they're going from
 
04:09:56.990 --> 04:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
January through December every single
 
04:09:59.109 --> 04:09:59.119 align:start position:0%
year uh Massachusetts is a full-time
 
04:10:01.349 --> 04:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
legislature I didn't hear from them so I
 
04:10:03.429 --> 04:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
didn't include them on my list but of
 
04:10:05.870 --> 04:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
the ones I mentioned um only only
 
04:10:07.630 --> 04:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania is a full-time legislature
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
so it is it is truly your
 
04:10:12.870 --> 04:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
determination that's why this is this is
 
04:10:16.590 --> 04:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:16.600 --> 04:10:18.349 align:start position:0%
 
determination

04:10:18.349 --> 04:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
determination
 
04:10:22.070 --> 04:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
um talk to us a little about the the
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
request by a former member of the
 
04:10:29.109 --> 04:10:29.119 align:start position:0%
general court um how how would that be
 
04:10:32.590 --> 04:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
handled um if would it just purely be
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
able to say this person served in the
 
04:10:38.950 --> 04:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
legislature from from this year to this
 
04:10:42.269 --> 04:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
year and just assume that they had a
 
04:10:46.469 --> 04:10:46.479 align:start position:0%
full-time 30 hours um again I that that
 
04:10:49.590 --> 04:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
determination about full-time is is one
 
04:10:52.630 --> 04:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
that you all would be making in policy
 
04:10:57.469 --> 04:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
uh if if this were law if if if you left
 
04:10:59.469 --> 04:10:59.479 align:start position:0%
the legislature at the end of this term
 
04:11:02.469 --> 04:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
and called me in March of next year and
 
04:11:05.429 --> 04:11:05.439 align:start position:0%
said Paul I'd like to uh do this Public
 
04:11:07.149 --> 04:11:07.159 align:start position:0%
service loan forgiveness program and I
 
04:11:10.109 --> 04:11:10.119 align:start position:0%
have the form uh would you be able to
 
04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
sign it um you would hand me the form
 
04:11:14.469 --> 04:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
and I would fill out the small box at
 
04:11:16.990 --> 04:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
the top that's says your start date and
 
04:11:21.389 --> 04:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
your end date uh in terms of your
 
04:11:26.030 --> 04:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
service which would be the the um first
 
04:11:29.149 --> 04:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
day I was a legislator and the last day
 
04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
I was a legisl that's correct sir thank
 
04:11:31.800 --> 04:11:33.510 align:start position:0%
I was a legisl that's correct sir thank
you

04:11:33.510 --> 04:11:33.520 align:start position:0%

um thank you thank you Mr chair just in
 
04:11:39.030 --> 04:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
followup to that that would be if there
 
04:11:42.309 --> 04:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
was an addendum to change line nine um
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
well if if that was changed to the clerk
 
04:11:46.710 --> 04:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
I mean but again it doesn't have to be
 
04:11:48.429 --> 04:11:48.439 align:start position:0%
the clerk it can be the administrative
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
office that's your preference uh it it
 
04:11:52.349 --> 04:11:52.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter to be to be honest
 
04:11:54.590 --> 04:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
um I I would note of the states that I
 
04:11:56.910 --> 04:11:56.920 align:start position:0%

04:14:00.510 --> 04:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
importantly I'm honored to walk into
 
04:14:02.710 --> 04:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
rep's Hall on behalf of my
 
04:14:04.870 --> 04:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
constituents as a kid touring government
 
04:14:06.510 --> 04:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
buildings I wondered what it would be
 
04:14:09.269 --> 04:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
like to sit in those chairs and now I
 
04:14:12.070 --> 04:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
know I'm humbled and
 
04:14:14.469 --> 04:14:14.479 align:start position:0%
grateful when I first told my mom I was
 
04:14:17.830 --> 04:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
running for office she apologized to me
 
04:14:20.389 --> 04:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
she said oh Chris I'm sorry we weren't
 
04:14:23.469 --> 04:14:23.479 align:start position:0%
born into a rich family I wish we were
 
04:14:25.389 --> 04:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
Rich enough to support you to allow you
 
04:14:26.750 --> 04:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
to do what you
 
04:14:30.149 --> 04:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
love she knew that I live alone she knew
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
that my mortgage my utilities everything
 
04:14:34.830 --> 04:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
was 100% on my working
 
04:14:37.870 --> 04:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
shoulders I would need to balance both
 
04:14:39.670 --> 04:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
I assured her that I would figure it out
 
04:14:41.630 --> 04:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
if I won and just because of her
 
04:14:45.269 --> 04:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
reaction I worked extremely hard on my
 
04:14:47.149 --> 04:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
campaign this was something that I
 
04:14:49.429 --> 04:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to prove could be done and
 
04:14:52.269 --> 04:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
possibly I could help change
 
04:14:54.790 --> 04:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
it I started thinking about what she had
 
04:14:56.590 --> 04:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
said and I thought about all of those
 
04:14:59.109 --> 04:14:59.119 align:start position:0%
doors that I knocked on so many were
 
04:15:01.469 --> 04:15:01.479 align:start position:0%
happy to see me a young self-made
 
04:15:05.349 --> 04:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
working woman running for office and I
 
04:15:07.830 --> 04:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
won my boss at the time said that she
 
04:15:09.990 --> 04:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
would allow me to use my time off
 
04:15:13.149 --> 04:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
however I noticed in December of 2022
 
04:15:14.550 --> 04:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
that there would be an
 
04:15:17.309 --> 04:15:17.319 align:start position:0%
issue I went from receiving a bonus in
 
04:15:20.510 --> 04:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
November 2022 for a job well done on a
 
04:15:23.229 --> 04:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
very large project to my boss suddenly
 
04:15:25.950 --> 04:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
being very suspicious of my working
 
04:15:28.630 --> 04:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
hours suddenly I was having check-in
 
04:15:32.109 --> 04:15:32.119 align:start position:0%
sessions to see what I worked on all day
 
04:15:33.670 --> 04:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
um I was accused of paying more
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
attention to State House duties than my
 
04:15:39.030 --> 04:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
day-to-day I was working 15-hour days in
 
04:15:41.469 --> 04:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
a salaried position and as you know
 
04:15:43.830 --> 04:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
legislative duties didn't really start
 
04:15:46.269 --> 04:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
until January
 
04:15:48.830 --> 04:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
20123 um I became the department
 
04:15:51.189 --> 04:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
scapegoat because I was assumed it it
 
04:15:53.070 --> 04:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
was assumed that I was just working on
 
04:15:56.030 --> 04:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire issues which of course had
 
04:15:57.710 --> 04:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
not started
 
04:16:00.990 --> 04:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
yet um I knew i' knew I knew that I'd
 
04:16:03.630 --> 04:16:03.640 align:start position:0%
need to find a new job but this was now
 
04:16:04.990 --> 04:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
going to be difficult given the
 
04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
legislative calendar I would need to
 
04:16:09.469 --> 04:16:09.479 align:start position:0%
immediately ask for days off as a new
 
04:16:11.550 --> 04:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
hire for the ve at the very least the
 
04:16:14.349 --> 04:16:14.359 align:start position:0%
house session days my job search was
 
04:16:15.870 --> 04:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
further delayed because I found out I
 
04:16:17.990 --> 04:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
needed another knee surgery and I needed
 
04:16:20.830 --> 04:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
to keep my job until the surgery date
 
04:16:22.349 --> 04:16:22.359 align:start position:0%
for the medical insurance and the
 
04:16:25.149 --> 04:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
short-term disability from January to
 
04:16:27.429 --> 04:16:27.439 align:start position:0%
March 2023 the earliest I was able to
 
04:16:29.469 --> 04:16:29.479 align:start position:0%
schedule my surgery my attendance here
 
04:16:29.479 --> 04:16:30.269 align:start position:0%
schedule my surgery my attendance here
was

04:16:30.269 --> 04:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:16:33.109 --> 04:16:33.119 align:start position:0%
sporadic I remember one day you all were
 
04:16:35.590 --> 04:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
voting on education bills while I was
 
04:16:37.349 --> 04:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
crying in my workplace back bathroom
 
04:16:39.269 --> 04:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
because I was not allowed the day off to
 
04:16:41.229 --> 04:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
vote on my constituent
 
04:16:43.469 --> 04:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
behalf the reason I couldn't take the
 
04:16:45.750 --> 04:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
day off for voting session despite
 
04:16:49.149 --> 04:16:49.159 align:start position:0%
having a crude time off uh was because
 
04:16:51.670 --> 04:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
of my co-workers birthday it was the
 
04:16:54.149 --> 04:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
same day that I needed off my
 
04:16:55.990 --> 04:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
constituents were not represented for
 
04:16:58.910 --> 04:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
Life altering votes due to a long-term
 
04:17:01.469 --> 04:17:01.479 align:start position:0%
lack of Staffing in my department and my
 
04:17:01.479 --> 04:17:03.030 align:start position:0%
lack of Staffing in my department and my
co-worker

04:17:03.030 --> 04:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
co-worker
 
04:17:05.070 --> 04:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
birthday I checked with some lawyer
 
04:17:07.149 --> 04:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
friends and found out that I didn't have
 
04:17:10.149 --> 04:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
any recourse I didn't have any
 
04:17:13.070 --> 04:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
protections I take my oath of office
 
04:17:16.309 --> 04:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
very seriously and every single absence
 
04:17:19.229 --> 04:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
broke my heart I was counting down the
 
04:17:21.510 --> 04:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
days to my knee surgery in late March
 
04:17:24.550 --> 04:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
and just over one week after my PCL
 
04:17:26.710 --> 04:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
surgery I was on the house floor in a
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
wheelchair for the state budget
 
04:17:32.469 --> 04:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
vote during my leave for my surgery I
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
worked with a recruiter to find a new
 
04:17:37.269 --> 04:17:37.279 align:start position:0%
job we had carefully had to plan when to
 
04:17:40.149 --> 04:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
bring up my State Rep work with any new
 
04:17:42.590 --> 04:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
employer I made it a condition of my new
 
04:17:44.950 --> 04:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
employment that they allow me the T the
 
04:17:46.750 --> 04:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
time off to go to session days and
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
committee work and I haven't missed a
 
04:17:48.960 --> 04:17:50.149 align:start position:0%
committee work and I haven't missed a
day

04:17:50.149 --> 04:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:17:52.870 --> 04:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
since however at the end of December my
 
04:17:54.790 --> 04:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
position was eliminated in a group
 
04:17:58.030 --> 04:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
layoff I am yet again needing to find a
 
04:18:00.750 --> 04:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
full-time new position of employment
 
04:18:03.790 --> 04:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
while balancing State Rep employee State
 
04:18:03.800 --> 04:18:05.710 align:start position:0%
while balancing State Rep employee State
Rep

04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
Rep
 
04:18:09.229 --> 04:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
schedules whenever whatever my employer
 
04:18:11.389 --> 04:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
or whatever employer decides to take me
 
04:18:15.510 --> 04:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
on they'll need to immediately Allow Me
 
04:18:19.269 --> 04:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
session days off this is a hard ask and
 
04:18:21.189 --> 04:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
right now I'm trying to stretch whatever
 
04:18:23.149 --> 04:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
savings I have in order to get through
 
04:18:26.189 --> 04:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
as much legislative session as possible
 
04:18:28.870 --> 04:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
I will remind you that I live alone my
 
04:18:32.710 --> 04:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
mortgage is 100% on my own shoulders my
 
04:18:34.870 --> 04:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
fiance is not moving in until
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
September having this kind of protection
 
04:18:40.269 --> 04:18:40.279 align:start position:0%
would make it easier for me to get the
 
04:18:43.750 --> 04:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
time off approved I am not the only rep
 
04:18:44.790 --> 04:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
that this would
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
help this bill is very limited in scope
 
04:18:51.309 --> 04:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
with the house so evenly divided even
 
04:18:53.950 --> 04:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
one absence on session days on both
 
04:18:57.189 --> 04:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
sides makes a difference I believe all
 
04:18:59.349 --> 04:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
parties are aware of just how crucial it
 
04:19:02.229 --> 04:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
is that every rep is in their seat to
 
04:19:05.349 --> 04:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
vote these are lifechanging issues for
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
the people we represent
 
04:19:09.990 --> 04:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
and that is something I don't ever take
 
04:19:13.389 --> 04:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
lightly I have limited HB 1290 to
 
04:19:16.349 --> 04:19:16.359 align:start position:0%
session days only because those are
 
04:19:18.790 --> 04:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
mandatory committee days meetings
 
04:19:21.630 --> 04:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
campaign events these are not protected
 
04:19:22.590 --> 04:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
in this
 
04:19:25.630 --> 04:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
bill I have capped a maximum number of
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
hours that an employee is allowed to
 
04:19:30.950 --> 04:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
request I have also included a hardship
 
04:19:33.109 --> 04:19:33.119 align:start position:0%
clause in case a business needed to be
 
04:19:34.510 --> 04:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
Exempted for any
 
04:19:36.830 --> 04:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
reason there is one piece that that I
 
04:19:38.510 --> 04:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
would like to put through an amendment
 
04:19:40.670 --> 04:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
on and that's line number five it should
 
04:19:45.030 --> 04:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
say up to 168 hours this is the maximum
 
04:19:47.550 --> 04:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
hours cap however I wanted to see the
 
04:19:49.469 --> 04:19:49.479 align:start position:0%
committee's response to this bill before
 
04:19:52.109 --> 04:19:52.119 align:start position:0%
drafting any amendment to include any
 
04:19:55.030 --> 04:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
potential additional changes uh that the
 
04:19:56.910 --> 04:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
committee thought might be
 
04:19:59.469 --> 04:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
helpful why is it important to fix this
 
04:20:01.309 --> 04:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
issue why do we need
 
04:20:03.870 --> 04:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
protection here is what I believe New
 
04:20:05.309 --> 04:20:05.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has gained due to my
 
04:20:07.109 --> 04:20:07.119 align:start position:0%

04:20:56.990 --> 04:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
these unique experiences which my
 
04:20:59.429 --> 04:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
personal voice brings to this body when
 
04:21:02.790 --> 04:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
I've been not working my 9-to-5 job have
 
04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
been or I have been able to substitute
 
04:21:07.750 --> 04:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
on other committees to contribute
 
04:21:11.469 --> 04:21:11.479 align:start position:0%
additional knowledge I'm only one person
 
04:21:14.229 --> 04:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
you all have your own voices and your
 
04:21:16.349 --> 04:21:16.359 align:start position:0%
own experiences that you're bringing in
 
04:21:18.269 --> 04:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
the legislative body every time you
 
04:21:20.830 --> 04:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
attend there are many other working reps
 
04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
that have résumés and experiences that
 
04:21:25.389 --> 04:21:25.399 align:start position:0%
are similar to mine and some that are
 
04:21:27.309 --> 04:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
very different from mine their
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
experiences should be represented as
 
04:21:31.830 --> 04:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
well they should have a voice at the
 
04:21:34.670 --> 04:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
table additionally I believe not having
 
04:21:36.670 --> 04:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
these protection protections lead leaves
 
04:21:41.070 --> 04:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
our volunteer legislature vulnerable to
 
04:21:43.990 --> 04:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
influence to be clear this was not my
 
04:21:46.710 --> 04:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
situation at at this level but I was
 
04:21:48.990 --> 04:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
drafting this bill and it made me
 
04:21:51.830 --> 04:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
question what would happen if an emplo
 
04:21:54.269 --> 04:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
employer or a manager of a state
 
04:21:56.309 --> 04:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
representative understood what bills
 
04:21:58.710 --> 04:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
were being voted on and denied the
 
04:22:01.710 --> 04:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
legislature the requested day
 
04:22:04.550 --> 04:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
off without this kind of protection we
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
are left at the mercy of our employer to
 
04:22:09.030 --> 04:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
allow us the time as both parties are
 
04:22:12.269 --> 04:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
aware just one absence can drastically
 
04:22:14.750 --> 04:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
change a vote in this nearly evenly
 
04:22:18.750 --> 04:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
divided House people of working age ages
 
04:22:22.030 --> 04:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
19 to 64 make up the driving force of
 
04:22:24.670 --> 04:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
our state's economy these are people we
 
04:22:27.630 --> 04:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
need to hear more representation from I
 
04:22:30.830 --> 04:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate our volunteer legislature I
 
04:22:32.910 --> 04:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I'm able to serve
 
04:22:34.870 --> 04:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
without needing to be a career
 
04:22:37.229 --> 04:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
politician or a lawyer
 
04:22:39.950 --> 04:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
I love that we have such a variety of
 
04:22:42.750 --> 04:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
experience in our legislative body
 
04:22:44.990 --> 04:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
however it's a double-edged sword
 
04:22:47.070 --> 04:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
because we don't receive much in
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
compensation our legislative body leans
 
04:22:52.109 --> 04:22:52.119 align:start position:0%
heavily on people who are retired who
 
04:22:54.710 --> 04:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
are business owners who are managers
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
rather than front-facing employees and
 
04:22:59.349 --> 04:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
independently wealthy individuals or
 
04:23:01.229 --> 04:23:01.239 align:start position:0%
individuals who are able to rely on
 
04:23:02.630 --> 04:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
their spouse's
 
04:23:06.030 --> 04:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
income we are leaving out so many voices
 
04:23:09.630 --> 04:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
which need to be directly
 
04:23:13.109 --> 04:23:13.119 align:start position:0%
represented this bill hb1 1290 in my
 
04:23:14.870 --> 04:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
opinion is the least we can do for our
 
04:23:16.910 --> 04:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
working Representatives like myself and
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
immediately necessary to protect our
 
04:23:20.950 --> 04:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
jobs and most importantly our
 
04:23:22.870 --> 04:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
constituents voices in the
 
04:23:27.149 --> 04:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
legislature so thank you I'm open to
 
04:23:29.790 --> 04:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
04:23:32.510 --> 04:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
um other
 
04:23:37.389 --> 04:23:37.399 align:start position:0%
questions I have a quick one yeah go um
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
you show here in Roman three an employer
 
04:23:43.950 --> 04:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
may not discharge an employee who is a
 
04:23:45.710 --> 04:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
member of the general
 
04:23:45.720 --> 04:23:47.229 align:start position:0%
member of the general
court

04:23:47.229 --> 04:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
court
 
04:23:51.429 --> 04:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
um should an employer be allowed to
 
04:23:55.389 --> 04:23:55.399 align:start position:0%
reassign or hire someone else for your
 
04:23:57.269 --> 04:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
position I would think that that would
 
04:24:01.590 --> 04:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
be acceptable um I think that ultimately
 
04:24:03.710 --> 04:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
I mean needs must in an organization
 
04:24:05.790 --> 04:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to impact businesses
 
04:24:08.910 --> 04:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
negativ ly however um I really think
 
04:24:10.710 --> 04:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
that we need to be able to be allowed to
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
be on the floor for house
 
04:24:17.269 --> 04:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
votes thank you for your answer um is
 
04:24:18.870 --> 04:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
would you
 
04:24:22.910 --> 04:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
also what would be your opinion of
 
04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
um this uh a size limit on um who this
 
04:24:30.870 --> 04:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
would apply to whether it would be I
 
04:24:33.870 --> 04:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
don't know uh 50 employers that have
 
04:24:37.550 --> 04:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
over 50 employees or is there was that
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
considered and it was considered be yeah
 
04:24:42.750 --> 04:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
I I thought about that originally um and
 
04:24:45.950 --> 04:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
I I left it out right now and I wanted
 
04:24:47.510 --> 04:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
to see what the committee's thoughts on
 
04:24:51.790 --> 04:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
this were um because I did include the
 
04:24:53.750 --> 04:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
hardship clause which allows any
 
04:24:56.630 --> 04:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
employer the ability to apply for um
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
hardship situations and what would those
 
04:25:02.429 --> 04:25:02.439 align:start position:0%
hardships so potentially be again I've
 
04:25:04.910 --> 04:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
worked for I've worked for nonprofits
 
04:25:07.590 --> 04:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
that had only three employ es um I can
 
04:25:09.910 --> 04:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
understand only having three employees
 
04:25:13.109 --> 04:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
would leave you a a major shortage um in
 
04:25:17.590 --> 04:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
staff um and Staffing requirements um
 
04:25:20.750 --> 04:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
would be my main concern so I completely
 
04:25:23.790 --> 04:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
understand that from an employer
 
04:25:27.710 --> 04:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
perspective last question for me is
 
04:25:32.349 --> 04:25:32.359 align:start position:0%
um I would assume um or maybe I
 
04:25:35.309 --> 04:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't assume um was there any
 
04:25:38.229 --> 04:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you to have the
 
04:25:41.950 --> 04:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
discussion with your employer prior to
 
04:25:45.269 --> 04:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
running yes and I did and she said that
 
04:25:47.910 --> 04:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
she would um support me being at the
 
04:25:51.109 --> 04:25:51.119 align:start position:0%
state house um however it's never a
 
04:25:54.229 --> 04:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
problem until it
 
04:26:02.750 --> 04:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:05.670 --> 04:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
you yeah no other hands went up so I'm
 
04:26:08.070 --> 04:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
saying no other questions um thank you
 
04:26:12.349 --> 04:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony um I do
 
04:26:15.990 --> 04:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
have a pink card uh from representative
 
04:26:19.229 --> 04:26:19.239 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reed um who asked for five minutes
 
04:26:20.750 --> 04:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
it would be great if you could be less
 
04:26:22.630 --> 04:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
so we could get back I think I can
 
04:26:24.550 --> 04:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
accommodate the chair's request for the
 
04:26:26.030 --> 04:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
record my name is Ellen Reed I represent
 
04:26:28.469 --> 04:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 10 new Mark and newfields and
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
I just want to preface my testimony by
 
04:26:32.469 --> 04:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
saying I was told that I came in a
 
04:26:35.109 --> 04:26:35.119 align:start position:0%
little bit hot during the last uh Bill
 
04:26:36.910 --> 04:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
hearing and I want to apologize any of
 
04:26:39.710 --> 04:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
you that know me personally no I'm a
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
little fiery um I want to testify to my
 
04:26:45.229 --> 04:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
personal experience with this issue I'm
 
04:26:47.389 --> 04:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
very grateful that the prime sponsor has
 
04:26:49.710 --> 04:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
put this bill in uh after getting
 
04:26:52.269 --> 04:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
elected I got I decided I needed a
 
04:26:54.189 --> 04:26:54.199 align:start position:0%
part-time job instead of my regular
 
04:26:56.389 --> 04:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
full-time job so I went and looked and I
 
04:26:58.590 --> 04:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
got a part-time job driving for public
 
04:27:00.070 --> 04:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
transit a
 
04:27:00.080 --> 04:27:02.109 align:start position:0%
transit a
government

04:27:02.109 --> 04:27:02.119 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:27:06.389 --> 04:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
position um and uh and they told I
 
04:27:08.149 --> 04:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
explained I'm a State Rep and I'm going
 
04:27:09.710 --> 04:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
to need a little bit of flexibility
 
04:27:12.109 --> 04:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
around certain days and they said that's
 
04:27:13.790 --> 04:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
fine and I got hired and I worked and
 
04:27:16.830 --> 04:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
everything was fine we got a new manager
 
04:27:19.630 --> 04:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
um and then things weren't fine and when
 
04:27:21.950 --> 04:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
I asked and this is back before we were
 
04:27:24.030 --> 04:27:24.040 align:start position:0%
very very very very closely divided this
 
04:27:27.309 --> 04:27:27.319 align:start position:0%
is four terms ago and so bills dying on
 
04:27:30.389 --> 04:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
a tie was not really a thing so much it
 
04:27:33.510 --> 04:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
was like happened once a year maybe and
 
04:27:36.389 --> 04:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
I asked for time off to go to session
 
04:27:38.830 --> 04:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
and my employer said absolutely not you
 
04:27:42.349 --> 04:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
have to work and uh I found out later
 
04:27:44.510 --> 04:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
that my employer my my manager this
 
04:27:46.149 --> 04:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
particular person was not politically
 
04:27:49.109 --> 04:27:49.119 align:start position:0%
aligned with me um and I missed session
 
04:27:52.550 --> 04:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
that day and a bill failed it went
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
against the way I would have voted on a
 
04:27:57.510 --> 04:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
tie and I let my employer know that that
 
04:28:01.030 --> 04:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
was never going to happen again and I
 
04:28:04.349 --> 04:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
asked um several people at the state
 
04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
house uh the speaker's office I asked my
 
04:28:09.670 --> 04:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
leadership I asked different
 
04:28:12.109 --> 04:28:12.119 align:start position:0%
administrative staff people if they
 
04:28:13.590 --> 04:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
could give me a letter not a letter
 
04:28:15.550 --> 04:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
telling my employer that they have to
 
04:28:18.429 --> 04:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
excuse me but only a letter quoting the
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution because in our state
 
04:28:24.030 --> 04:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
constitution several things the general
 
04:28:27.349 --> 04:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
court can excuse a member from jury duty
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
jury duty by law um excuses you from
 
04:28:34.830 --> 04:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
work so the weird thing was that if I
 
04:28:36.910 --> 04:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
had gotten jury dut Duty I would have
 
04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
been excused from work legally but even
 
04:28:41.510 --> 04:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
though I have a constitutional Duty that
 
04:28:43.590 --> 04:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
supersedes jury duty and I can get out
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
of jury duty to go do
 
04:28:48.349 --> 04:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
session that doesn't excuse me legally
 
04:28:49.790 --> 04:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
from work so we're giving more
 
04:28:51.189 --> 04:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
protections of jury duty than our
 
04:28:52.950 --> 04:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement second thing
 
04:28:55.870 --> 04:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution that even the police
 
04:28:59.269 --> 04:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
cannot detain me from going to session
 
04:29:01.189 --> 04:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
the police cannot detain me even if I'm
 
04:29:04.429 --> 04:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
actively speeding running stop lights
 
04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
they cannot they can follow me they can
 
04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
wait for me outside a session they can
 
04:29:10.349 --> 04:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
write me up afterwards but they cannot
 
04:29:12.349 --> 04:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
detain me if I'm on my way to represent
 
04:29:15.469 --> 04:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
my constituents and thirdly and this
 
04:29:18.309 --> 04:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
rarely happens but the police can be
 
04:29:20.750 --> 04:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
ordered to come and pick me up at my
 
04:29:24.389 --> 04:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
home and bring me in by force meaning
 
04:29:27.469 --> 04:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
forget employer and employee relations
 
04:29:30.030 --> 04:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
and work and all of that it's saying my
 
04:29:32.109 --> 04:29:32.119 align:start position:0%
constitutional Duty that I sacredly took
 
04:29:34.630 --> 04:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
when I entered into public office
 
04:29:38.630 --> 04:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
supersedes even my autonomy and freedom
 
04:29:40.229 --> 04:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
that that's the agreement I made by
 
04:29:43.830 --> 04:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
taking on office and all I wanted was
 
04:29:46.389 --> 04:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
those quotes from the Constitution from
 
04:29:49.030 --> 04:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
somebody in this building and I was
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
unable to get
 
04:29:54.429 --> 04:29:54.439 align:start position:0%
it that employment didn't end well but
 
04:29:57.950 --> 04:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
um anyway because of my experience and
 
04:29:59.109 --> 04:29:59.119 align:start position:0%
because of the experience of other
 
04:30:01.469 --> 04:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
people and how important it is to get
 
04:30:04.389 --> 04:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
not just people who don't have to work
 
04:30:06.229 --> 04:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
but the people who have to work to
 
04:30:07.790 --> 04:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
represent the working people of New
 
04:30:10.269 --> 04:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would urge you to support
 
04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
this and I'll take
 
04:30:15.309 --> 04:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions yes
 
04:30:17.790 --> 04:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
representative turot I kind of just want
 
04:30:19.990 --> 04:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
to make a statement that's why I had to
 
04:30:21.910 --> 04:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
have a break in service would you
 
04:30:23.710 --> 04:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
believe would you believe would you
 
04:30:25.590 --> 04:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
believe that's why I had to have a break
 
04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
in service because one road agent
 
04:30:29.710 --> 04:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't let me go the next the new one
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
did I would absolutely believe that and
 
04:30:35.189 --> 04:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
what the prime sponsor spoke of is
 
04:30:36.510 --> 04:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
something that that did not happen to
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
her but might happen absolutely happened
 
04:30:41.109 --> 04:30:41.119 align:start position:0%
to me this person knew I mean it's it's
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
not a secret what my beliefs are
 
04:30:46.590 --> 04:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
politically and uh he absolutely did not
 
04:30:48.469 --> 04:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
want me to do my job and serve my
 
04:30:50.790 --> 04:30:50.800 align:start position:0%

that I'm a nurse and I'm able to have
 
04:32:13.750 --> 04:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
this position which enables me to be
 
04:32:16.710 --> 04:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
here I have had many daytime jobs and if
 
04:32:19.109 --> 04:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
I was in that position right now I would
 
04:32:21.469 --> 04:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
need this bill to be able to continue to
 
04:32:24.670 --> 04:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
do what I do and you know that can
 
04:32:26.189 --> 04:32:26.199 align:start position:0%

only the language of the bill and I will
 
04:34:33.949 --> 04:34:33.959 align:start position:0%

04:34:36.629 --> 04:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
beyond the language of the bill bill so
 
04:34:39.310 --> 04:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
with that I would welcome representative
 
04:34:42.109 --> 04:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
Weber um thank you welcome back to
 
04:34:45.709 --> 04:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration thank you sir
 
04:34:48.150 --> 04:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
um my for the record my name is Lucy
 
04:34:51.349 --> 04:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
Weber I represent chesher County
 
04:34:55.349 --> 04:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
District five which is Walpole and S uh
 
04:34:58.429 --> 04:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
the I think 11th town I've represented
 
04:35:00.150 --> 04:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
in chesher
 
04:35:03.310 --> 04:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
County this without discussing the
 
04:35:05.310 --> 04:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
situation out of which this bill arose
 
04:35:09.150 --> 04:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
at all uh the issue here
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
is what the duties of the Attorney
 
04:35:14.789 --> 04:35:14.799 align:start position:0%
General are when it comes to the
 
04:35:17.830 --> 04:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
attorney general's attention that a
 
04:35:21.310 --> 04:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
member of the general court may not
 
04:35:23.310 --> 04:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
still be resident in the district from
 
04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
which they were elected that's the
 
04:35:29.629 --> 04:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
language of the bill and the that is
 
04:35:32.869 --> 04:35:32.879 align:start position:0%
important because it is the job of the
 
04:35:35.709 --> 04:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to investigate any
 
04:35:38.230 --> 04:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
criminal matters that may arise out of
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
that but it is only the general court
 
04:35:45.150 --> 04:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
that can deal with the qualifications of
 
04:35:46.390 --> 04:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
its own
 
04:35:50.510 --> 04:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
members so the way the bill is drafted
 
04:35:53.269 --> 04:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
first of all it's not when the Attorney
 
04:35:55.949 --> 04:35:55.959 align:start position:0%
General hears a vague rumor that
 
04:35:58.670 --> 04:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
somebody may be living somewhere else
 
04:36:00.910 --> 04:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's when the attorney general has
 
04:36:03.310 --> 04:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe that they are
 
04:36:06.869 --> 04:36:06.879 align:start position:0%
not living somewhere else the Attorney
 
04:36:10.429 --> 04:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
General must give notice not uh to the
 
04:36:13.429 --> 04:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
speaker and to the minority leader and
 
04:36:16.830 --> 04:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
to the clerk of the respective body or
 
04:36:18.910 --> 04:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate President and minority leader
 
04:36:22.510 --> 04:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
and Clerk and the purpose of that is so
 
04:36:25.869 --> 04:36:25.879 align:start position:0%
that those legislative leaders can then
 
04:36:27.070 --> 04:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
make a
 
04:36:29.869 --> 04:36:29.879 align:start position:0%
determination of the qualifications of
 
04:36:32.910 --> 04:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
the members of their body in accordance
 
04:36:34.590 --> 04:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
with the rules of their body and the
 
04:36:36.910 --> 04:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
wishes of the members of their body
 
04:36:38.230 --> 04:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
because that's the
 
04:36:42.670 --> 04:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
only place where that the house controls
 
04:36:45.230 --> 04:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
the the membership and the Senate
 
04:36:47.109 --> 04:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
controls its membership the Attorney
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
General doesn't get to weigh in on that
 
04:36:53.869 --> 04:36:53.879 align:start position:0%
and so the way the bill is drafted I
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
also specifically said that the Attorney
 
04:36:58.349 --> 04:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
General shall not be compelled to
 
04:37:01.269 --> 04:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
provide details of any ongoing criminal
 
04:37:03.390 --> 04:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
investigation beyond the issue of
 
04:37:05.551 --> 04:37:05.561 align:start position:0%
residency that's all they
 
04:37:09.551 --> 04:37:09.561 align:start position:0%
need to disclose beyond that what they
 
04:37:13.189 --> 04:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
are doing is not our business and so
 
04:37:15.551 --> 04:37:15.561 align:start position:0%
with that I'll conclude my testimony
 
04:37:18.429 --> 04:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
it's really just a matter of clarifying
 
04:37:20.070 --> 04:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
how the different branches of government
 
04:37:22.189 --> 04:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
are going to communicate to each other
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
and making sure that
 
04:37:26.310 --> 04:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
everybody uh that the relevant people in
 
04:37:27.869 --> 04:37:27.879 align:start position:0%
each branch of government have the
 
04:37:30.109 --> 04:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
information that they need to uh do
 
04:37:31.349 --> 04:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
their own
 
04:37:33.551 --> 04:37:33.561 align:start position:0%
jobs and with that I'd be glad to take
 
04:37:35.670 --> 04:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
any questions that anybody has thank you
 
04:37:38.830 --> 04:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
um representative nutting Wong hey um as
 
04:37:45.109 --> 04:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
I read this um it just says that the um
 
04:37:48.109 --> 04:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
the that the Attorney General will
 
04:37:51.310 --> 04:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
contact or notify the presiding officer
 
04:37:56.230 --> 04:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
minority leader and clerk um then
 
04:37:59.029 --> 04:37:59.039 align:start position:0%
what that's not a matter for this
 
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
legislation the then what is a matter
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
either for the Senate and the Senate
 
04:38:06.750 --> 04:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
rules or if there aren't any rules for
 
04:38:09.070 --> 04:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
the leadership and the membership of the
 
04:38:12.109 --> 04:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
Senate and for the house the leadership
 
04:38:14.109 --> 04:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
and the membership of the house to
 
04:38:16.910 --> 04:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
determine but I didn't think that that
 
04:38:18.910 --> 04:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
was something I needed to include in the
 
04:38:21.310 --> 04:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
legislation I think that is a matter for
 
04:38:24.990 --> 04:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
each separate legislative body and as we
 
04:38:28.230 --> 04:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
know uh the things that we enact in this
 
04:38:30.269 --> 04:38:30.279 align:start position:0%
legislature don't bind the next
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislature they may have a very
 
04:38:34.390 --> 04:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
different way of dealing with it and the
 
04:38:38.029 --> 04:38:38.039 align:start position:0%
other thing is that over the
 
04:38:42.230 --> 04:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
years the when this issue has arisen
 
04:38:45.869 --> 04:38:45.879 align:start position:0%
generally each case is so very different
 
04:38:50.230 --> 04:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
from the last that it is very different
 
04:38:52.230 --> 04:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
to come up with a hard and fast
 
04:38:54.949 --> 04:38:54.959 align:start position:0%
procedure I mean I can think of an issue
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
where um this this wasn't ever an issue
 
04:39:01.310 --> 04:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
before this body but we did have a
 
04:39:03.070 --> 04:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
member whose house burned
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
down and it took
 
04:39:07.590 --> 04:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
well over a year for the house to be
 
04:39:09.629 --> 04:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
rebuilt I've had friends in that
 
04:39:11.349 --> 04:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
situation live in a trailer on their
 
04:39:14.429 --> 04:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
property which is no problem but that
 
04:39:18.429 --> 04:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
member was living in a rented apartment
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether that was in his
 
04:39:22.429 --> 04:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
district or not but if it was not in his
 
04:39:25.750 --> 04:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
district I don't think in that situation
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
that a member would lose their residency
 
04:39:29.750 --> 04:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
simply because they were in the process
 
04:39:32.349 --> 04:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
of rebuilding I mean we you know members
 
04:39:34.310 --> 04:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
can stay at their Lakehouse in the
 
04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
summer and they don't lose their
 
04:39:37.350 --> 04:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
residency they go to Florida they don't
 
04:39:38.270 --> 04:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
lose their
 
04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
residency uh so each case is very very
 
04:39:44.590 --> 04:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
different and I think different
 
04:39:47.270 --> 04:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
legislatures might adopt different
 
04:39:50.310 --> 04:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
policies and I think as we all know the
 
04:39:51.948 --> 04:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
body that we shouldn't be mentioning and
 
04:39:53.750 --> 04:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't have mentioned it and I
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
apologize uh might have very different
 
04:39:58.030 --> 04:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
ways of addressing their membership than
 
04:40:02.830 --> 04:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:06.150 --> 04:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
size any further questions
 
04:40:09.150 --> 04:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
I have one oh go ahead representative
 
04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
Hopson yeah thank you for taking my
 
04:40:14.070 --> 04:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
question uh just I don't know if you
 
04:40:15.550 --> 04:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned this at the beginning of your
 
04:40:17.948 --> 04:40:17.958 align:start position:0%
testimony and if you did I apologize but
 
04:40:21.030 --> 04:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
where does this information come from
 
04:40:23.948 --> 04:40:23.958 align:start position:0%
who decides that this is the purview of
 
04:40:25.550 --> 04:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General or what the
 
04:40:28.510 --> 04:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
Attorney General should that's beyond
 
04:40:30.830 --> 04:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
our perview because that's something to
 
04:40:33.070 --> 04:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
do with the Attorney General's office I
 
04:40:35.150 --> 04:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
don't know how the attorney General
 
04:40:37.030 --> 04:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
finds out what the Attorney General
 
04:40:39.550 --> 04:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
finds out nor should I because as the
 
04:40:42.310 --> 04:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
chair rightly pointed out that is a
 
04:40:44.750 --> 04:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
matter for them and their investigative
 
04:40:47.230 --> 04:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
staff and whoever calls their tip line
 
04:40:49.110 --> 04:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
and however that
 
04:40:53.070 --> 04:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
works I specifically omitted to put in
 
04:40:54.990 --> 04:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
how the Attorney General would find out
 
04:40:57.550 --> 04:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
because that's not my business I did
 
04:41:01.270 --> 04:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
want to make it so that um the Attorney
 
04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
General had to have probable cause to
 
04:41:07.310 --> 04:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
believe that this was true before they
 
04:41:09.830 --> 04:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh referred it to us because I don't
 
04:41:11.670 --> 04:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
want the Attorney General to have to
 
04:41:14.190 --> 04:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
deal with you know some person who calls
 
04:41:17.910 --> 04:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
up and says oh by the way uh that that
 
04:41:19.750 --> 04:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
was not my purpose it was only when
 
04:41:24.070 --> 04:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
there is a situation which the Attorney
 
04:41:26.510 --> 04:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
General believes Rises to probable cost
 
04:41:29.430 --> 04:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
which is a pretty uh well defined
 
04:41:33.868 --> 04:41:33.878 align:start position:0%
statute uh standard I should say and and
 
04:41:37.510 --> 04:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
um so that seemed like a good line as
 
04:41:42.510 --> 04:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:45.788 --> 04:41:45.798 align:start position:0%
complaint uh my question is a little
 
04:41:48.590 --> 04:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
different um although it does um concern
 
04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General I guess or or how
 
04:41:52.310 --> 04:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
the bill was
 
04:41:56.070 --> 04:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
drafted my question would be what would
 
04:41:59.550 --> 04:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
um what is meant to occur by the
 
04:42:01.708 --> 04:42:01.718 align:start position:0%
Attorney General providing that
 
04:42:03.910 --> 04:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
information to the people that you've
 
04:42:03.920 --> 04:42:05.350 align:start position:0%
information to the people that you've
mentioned

04:42:05.350 --> 04:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
04:42:08.788 --> 04:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
um versus a registered letter sent to
 
04:42:13.670 --> 04:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
the people um from whoever has that that
 
04:42:13.680 --> 04:42:16.430 align:start position:0%
the people um from whoever has that that
same

04:42:16.430 --> 04:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:20.590 --> 04:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
concern there are two different ways of
 
04:42:24.628 --> 04:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
notifying us that we might want to make
 
04:42:27.150 --> 04:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
inquiries into the situations of our
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
members uh there's nothing here that
 
04:42:32.590 --> 04:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
prevents somebody who is concerned from
 
04:42:36.310 --> 04:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh reporting it in different ways uh but
 
04:42:39.270 --> 04:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
the real concern that I had was that
 
04:42:41.150 --> 04:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
delicate balance for the Attorney
 
04:42:45.868 --> 04:42:45.878 align:start position:0%
General's office uh between
 
04:42:48.948 --> 04:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
their requirements of a criminal
 
04:42:52.270 --> 04:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
investigation and our need for the
 
04:42:54.830 --> 04:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
information so that we can do our own
 
04:42:56.788 --> 04:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
investigation so that we can make sure
 
04:42:58.830 --> 04:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
that we are following the Constitutional
 
04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
requirements that our members live in
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
their districts because our constitution
 
04:43:05.350 --> 04:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
says that when you're not living in your
 
04:43:06.628 --> 04:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
District you're no longer a
 
04:43:09.550 --> 04:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
representative and you know it's not oh
 
04:43:11.708 --> 04:43:11.718 align:start position:0%
I can leave base and come back and tag
 
04:43:13.750 --> 04:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm safe that's not what the
 
04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution says so um there are any
 
04:43:20.070 --> 04:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
number of other ways that this house or
 
04:43:23.390 --> 04:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate might find out about an issue
 
04:43:26.670 --> 04:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
or a possible issue uh but this one I
 
04:43:29.390 --> 04:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
thought was particularly delicate
 
04:43:31.150 --> 04:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
because it's very clear that the
 
04:43:33.390 --> 04:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
attorney general has to walk a very fine
 
04:43:34.990 --> 04:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
line but
 
04:43:37.350 --> 04:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
between that which is the duty of the
 
04:43:39.190 --> 04:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and that which
 
04:43:41.310 --> 04:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
is the duty of the general
 
04:43:45.270 --> 04:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
court uh thank you um is there any
 
04:43:47.750 --> 04:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
concern on your part about um
 
04:43:47.760 --> 04:43:50.110 align:start position:0%
concern on your part about um
simultaneous

04:43:50.110 --> 04:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
simultaneous
 
04:43:53.470 --> 04:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
investigations I don't think so because
 
04:43:57.310 --> 04:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
um again we each have our own Duty under
 
04:44:02.430 --> 04:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and um those should be
 
04:44:04.750 --> 04:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
separate ours should come from us theirs
 
04:44:08.470 --> 04:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
should come from theirs um and that's
 
04:44:10.948 --> 04:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
what separation of powers is all
 
04:44:13.310 --> 04:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
about thank you rep
 
04:44:15.670 --> 04:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
cable thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:44:19.628 --> 04:44:19.638 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um we it's it's
 
04:44:22.070 --> 04:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
very clear that the the general court
 
04:44:24.910 --> 04:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
acts acts on it it's not clear that we
 
04:44:27.430 --> 04:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
have to investigate it so my my concern
 
04:44:30.190 --> 04:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
would be on the on Dual investigation
 
04:44:32.070 --> 04:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem to be necessarily
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
where our part should be but after
 
04:44:36.510 --> 04:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
investigation then we're the ones that
 
04:44:41.150 --> 04:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
would act on that on us the the member
 
04:44:42.868 --> 04:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
and residency and that sort of thing and
 
04:44:44.628 --> 04:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
the AG would have on on the criminal
 
04:44:46.830 --> 04:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
side but it seems like the AG would be
 
04:44:50.708 --> 04:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
more apt to be able to investigate on
 
04:44:54.110 --> 04:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
both matters and then report back
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
afterwards the issue with that is there
 
04:45:00.190 --> 04:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
might be a situation that
 
04:45:02.868 --> 04:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
arose sometime in the
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
future when the Attorney General might
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
be investigating something for a very
 
04:45:12.750 --> 04:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
long period of time and might come to
 
04:45:16.948 --> 04:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that there was no
 
04:45:19.350 --> 04:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
residency and might report that to the
 
04:45:22.990 --> 04:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
general court and a member who had not
 
04:45:25.670 --> 04:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
been a resident for a long period of
 
04:45:28.708 --> 04:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
time might have been voting on bills
 
04:45:31.070 --> 04:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
that that member was not entitled to be
 
04:45:35.470 --> 04:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
voting on and that would be contrary to
 
04:45:37.868 --> 04:45:37.878 align:start position:0%
the Constitution of the State of New
 
04:45:42.750 --> 04:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it is incumbent upon us as
 
04:45:42.760 --> 04:45:43.830 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it is incumbent upon us as
a

04:45:43.830 --> 04:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:45:46.430 --> 04:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
legislature when we know that there
 
04:45:49.788 --> 04:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
might be an issue it is incumbent upon
 
04:45:52.670 --> 04:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
us to determine what steps we are going
 
04:45:55.350 --> 04:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
to take and that may or may not include
 
04:45:58.430 --> 04:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
investigation it may or may not include
 
04:46:00.750 --> 04:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
somebody deciding to hire a private
 
04:46:03.788 --> 04:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
investigator it may or may not be includ
 
04:46:06.430 --> 04:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
included simply talking to the
 
04:46:08.868 --> 04:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
legislator uh every case is very
 
04:46:13.150 --> 04:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
different but it is up to us to make
 
04:46:15.550 --> 04:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
sure that we are upholding the
 
04:46:19.510 --> 04:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I know that everybody
 
04:46:21.910 --> 04:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
in this body takes that responsibility
 
04:46:24.270 --> 04:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
terribly seriously we may not always
 
04:46:26.788 --> 04:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
agree on how it how it happens but we
 
04:46:28.868 --> 04:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
all take it seriously and the
 
04:46:32.430 --> 04:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution is very clear on this
 
04:46:35.548 --> 04:46:35.558 align:start position:0%
matter thank thank you
 
04:46:38.070 --> 04:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh seeing no
 
04:46:41.708 --> 04:46:41.718 align:start position:0%
further one quick question rep
 
04:46:44.910 --> 04:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
kiery thank you for taking my question
 
04:46:46.548 --> 04:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry to do this but here comes
 
04:46:48.430 --> 04:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
the stupid one who does our
 
04:46:53.628 --> 04:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:57.510 --> 04:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
us when these issues have Arisen they
 
04:47:01.070 --> 04:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
have been dealt with differently by each
 
04:47:05.070 --> 04:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
legislator each legislature leg
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
legislature uh so in one case there was
 
04:47:13.868 --> 04:47:13.878 align:start position:0%
an investigation by this
 
04:47:18.750 --> 04:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
committee um in other cases you know
 
04:47:22.350 --> 04:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
um the other case I was involved with
 
04:47:25.270 --> 04:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't actually decided by the general
 
04:47:27.270 --> 04:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
court because it was a matter of whether
 
04:47:29.150 --> 04:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
somebody could appropriately appear on
 
04:47:31.230 --> 04:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
the ballot so it was decided by the
 
04:47:32.430 --> 04:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
ballot law
 
04:47:36.548 --> 04:47:36.558 align:start position:0%
commission uh but it's
 
04:47:39.470 --> 04:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
um the procedures that have been
 
04:47:42.150 --> 04:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
followed have been generally a matter
 
04:47:43.990 --> 04:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
for the speaker in the first
 
04:47:47.150 --> 04:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
instance um generally in consultation
 
04:47:49.190 --> 04:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
with the minority leader and using the
 
04:47:53.470 --> 04:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
expertise of the clerk and at that point
 
04:47:56.230 --> 04:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
you look at the facts and decide what to
 
04:47:59.750 --> 04:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
do and of course as always is the case
 
04:48:01.788 --> 04:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
if the members of the body as a whole
 
04:48:03.350 --> 04:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
believe that the speaker is taking
 
04:48:03.360 --> 04:48:04.670 align:start position:0%
believe that the speaker is taking
inappropriate

04:48:04.670 --> 04:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
04:48:07.548 --> 04:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
action they can certainly take action to
 
04:48:09.548 --> 04:48:09.558 align:start position:0%
correct the speaker in the direction
 
04:48:12.430 --> 04:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
that the speaker is taking so it is it
 
04:48:14.868 --> 04:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
is a power that's reserved to all of us
 
04:48:17.150 --> 04:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
usually delegated to one or two people
 
04:48:19.190 --> 04:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
or to a particular
 
04:48:22.270 --> 04:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
committee thank you um I'm assuming
 
04:48:24.868 --> 04:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
you're responsible for removing the
 
04:48:26.670 --> 04:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal note by
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment no
 
04:48:34.310 --> 04:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
I I have nothing to do with fiscal notes
 
04:48:36.590 --> 04:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
all right no worries someone will fess
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
up to it
 
04:48:42.548 --> 04:48:42.558 align:start position:0%
uh what my thing says is when completed
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note will be forwarded to the
 
04:48:47.110 --> 04:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
house clerk's office but I cannot
 
04:48:49.628 --> 04:48:49.638 align:start position:0%
imagine how there would be a fiscal note
 
04:48:52.750 --> 04:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
to a bill that simply requires somebody
 
04:48:56.830 --> 04:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
to write a letter or send a
 
04:48:59.390 --> 04:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
transmission uh
 
04:49:03.190 --> 04:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
saying I have probable cause to believe
 
04:49:04.590 --> 04:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
I didn't even work required that they
 
04:49:07.470 --> 04:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
tell you what the probable cause was
 
04:49:09.788 --> 04:49:09.798 align:start position:0%
that representative Weber no longer
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
lives in her district and then it's up
 
04:49:13.708 --> 04:49:13.718 align:start position:0%
to the house to figure out what to do
 
04:49:16.788 --> 04:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
with that information we'll find out um
 
04:49:18.510 --> 04:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your
 
04:49:21.990 --> 04:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
testimony um thank you for the
 
04:49:25.510 --> 04:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity I have no other speakers on
 
04:49:25.520 --> 04:49:26.510 align:start position:0%
opportunity I have no other speakers on
this

04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:49:30.150 --> 04:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
bill um so with that I will close the
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
04:49:37.350 --> 04:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
1629 FN or not not um and find out
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
more and with that we can move on to
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
because we're P our a lot of time to uh
 
04:49:46.830 --> 04:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:49:49.390 --> 04:49:49.400 align:start position:0%

04:49:51.910 --> 04:49:51.920 align:start position:0%

Administration

04:50:37.430 --> 04:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:39.628 --> 04:50:39.638 align:start position:0%

uh so thank you Mr chair and honorable
 
04:50:46.788 --> 04:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
members of the legislative
 
04:50:48.788 --> 04:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
Administration committee philler record
 
04:50:50.788 --> 04:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
my name is Mark mlan representing
 
04:50:52.510 --> 04:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro district 15 which is
 
04:50:55.708 --> 04:50:55.718 align:start position:0%
Manchester Ward 8 and I'm here to
 
04:50:57.628 --> 04:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
introduce HB
 
04:51:00.430 --> 04:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
1152 which would add uh the mental
 
04:51:03.110 --> 04:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
health flag uh to the statutory list of
 
04:51:05.590 --> 04:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
flags that can be flown at the state
 
04:51:07.470 --> 04:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
house uh one of the things that I do
 
04:51:11.510 --> 04:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
want to stress is that unlike the P flag
 
04:51:14.030 --> 04:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
um this bill
 
04:51:17.830 --> 04:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
um you know States explicitly that uh
 
04:51:19.548 --> 04:51:19.558 align:start position:0%
the mental health flag will only be
 
04:51:21.948 --> 04:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
flown at the discretion of legislative
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
leadership it's it's a may be flown not
 
04:51:27.310 --> 04:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
a shall be flown which is different than
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
the PW flag which shall be flown so it
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
basically allows it to be flown at a
 
04:51:35.470 --> 04:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
discretion and uh the the reasoning
 
04:51:37.868 --> 04:51:37.878 align:start position:0%
behind this was a year ago a work
 
04:51:39.470 --> 04:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
colleague of mine whose daughter-in-law
 
04:51:41.430 --> 04:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
Works in uh the mental health field and
 
04:51:43.628 --> 04:51:43.638 align:start position:0%
who will testify later um he approached
 
04:51:46.628 --> 04:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
me and he said look you know um May is
 
04:51:49.628 --> 04:51:49.638 align:start position:0%
coming up May is mental health month and
 
04:51:50.868 --> 04:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
um you know my daughter-in-law was
 
04:51:53.190 --> 04:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
wondering if the mental health flag
 
04:51:56.150 --> 04:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
could be uh flown on the 1st of May to
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
kind of open up mental health month so I
 
04:52:00.830 --> 04:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
went and I approached uh the chief of
 
04:52:02.548 --> 04:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
staff with the request and he came back
 
04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
and he said it's not a bad idea however
 
04:52:08.110 --> 04:52:08.120 align:start position:0%
no flag can be flown at the state house
 
04:52:10.510 --> 04:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
unless it is on the statutory list
 
04:52:12.670 --> 04:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
because you know we we have we we just
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
have requests every single day so it has
 
04:52:17.548 --> 04:52:17.558 align:start position:0%
to be something that's on the list that
 
04:52:18.868 --> 04:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
you know the whole body of the
 
04:52:20.868 --> 04:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
legislature agrees and there's consensus
 
04:52:22.948 --> 04:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
around it so I told the news to my
 
04:52:24.230 --> 04:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
colleague and of course he was
 
04:52:25.868 --> 04:52:25.878 align:start position:0%
disappointed he went back to his family
 
04:52:27.670 --> 04:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
and they were disappointed but I think
 
04:52:30.030 --> 04:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
everybody understood the wisdom of not
 
04:52:33.628 --> 04:52:33.638 align:start position:0%
being not allowing every flag to be uh
 
04:52:35.910 --> 04:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
flown it really needed to have broad
 
04:52:38.070 --> 04:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
support otherwise you know you could
 
04:52:40.708 --> 04:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
maybe you fly the NRA flag or something
 
04:52:41.910 --> 04:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know you really need to have
 
04:52:43.830 --> 04:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
something where you have a lot of
 
04:52:46.830 --> 04:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
consensus but as I thought about it upon
 
04:52:49.708 --> 04:52:49.718 align:start position:0%
reflection I really thought that going
 
04:52:51.868 --> 04:52:51.878 align:start position:0%
forward and and highlighting issues
 
04:52:53.948 --> 04:52:53.958 align:start position:0%
around mental health is something that
 
04:52:56.830 --> 04:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
it is has a lot of bipartisan support it
 
04:52:59.390 --> 04:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
is certainly something that is timely
 
04:53:01.230 --> 04:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
and if anything was worthy in a
 
04:53:03.910 --> 04:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
bipartisan way of having consensus to go
 
04:53:06.390 --> 04:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
forward to be added to the statutory
 
04:53:09.390 --> 04:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
list um it's the mental health flag and
 
04:53:11.310 --> 04:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
I think you know that's because
 
04:53:13.708 --> 04:53:13.718 align:start position:0%
everybody at at some point either in
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
themselves or somebody in their family
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
um have been touched at some point by by
 
04:53:20.590 --> 04:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
mental illness in my own case it was my
 
04:53:23.590 --> 04:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
mom when my sister was born when I was 5
 
04:53:25.868 --> 04:53:25.878 align:start position:0%
years old she had a complete mental
 
04:53:28.628 --> 04:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
collapse broke down became a prisoner of
 
04:53:31.110 --> 04:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
the house she couldn't even go down to
 
04:53:32.868 --> 04:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
the fire heightland that was too far
 
04:53:34.230 --> 04:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
away so
 
04:53:36.750 --> 04:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
basically not only she became a prisoner
 
04:53:38.670 --> 04:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
of the house but the entire family
 
04:53:40.390 --> 04:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
became a prisoner of the house and it
 
04:53:41.868 --> 04:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
was something that we all kind of went
 
04:53:43.470 --> 04:53:43.480 align:start position:0%
through and I didn't get to play with a
 
04:53:45.110 --> 04:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
lot of friends but I did get to hang out
 
04:53:48.310 --> 04:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
with Bob Barker and you know the prices
 
04:53:50.910 --> 04:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
right and and everything like that so it
 
04:53:52.910 --> 04:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
really was was limiting but the whole
 
04:53:56.190 --> 04:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
family kind of felt it um later on you
 
04:53:58.150 --> 04:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
know when she was finally able to get
 
04:54:00.190 --> 04:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
health and and understand that what she
 
04:54:01.788 --> 04:54:01.798 align:start position:0%
had was severe
 
04:54:04.990 --> 04:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
agoraphobia you know it had a name we
 
04:54:07.310 --> 04:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
were able to attack it and she was
 
04:54:11.030 --> 04:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
slowly over time able to to recapture
 
04:54:13.190 --> 04:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
her life and she could come down she
 
04:54:14.990 --> 04:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
could visit me in New Hampshire she
 
04:54:17.310 --> 04:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
could visit my brother in Texas and the
 
04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
quality of life in her final years was
 
04:54:22.430 --> 04:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
much better um and I know that many of
 
04:54:24.670 --> 04:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
you folks probably have your own story
 
04:54:27.510 --> 04:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
so um long and the short I think that
 
04:54:30.030 --> 04:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
allowing the flag to be flown at the
 
04:54:32.270 --> 04:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
legislature I don't think mental health
 
04:54:34.430 --> 04:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
is a controversial issue is and it would
 
04:54:36.510 --> 04:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to the people of this state
 
04:54:38.350 --> 04:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
that we recognize the severity of the
 
04:54:40.868 --> 04:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
issue and we understand that it has tend
 
04:54:42.948 --> 04:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
ruls that go into um a lot of other
 
04:54:45.350 --> 04:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
issues such as homelessness substance
 
04:54:47.910 --> 04:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
abuse suicide things of that nature and
 
04:54:49.390 --> 04:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
it would I think show that the
 
04:54:52.350 --> 04:54:52.360 align:start position:0%
legislature um is visibly committed to
 
04:54:54.430 --> 04:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
to having a role in ending it and so I
 
04:54:56.830 --> 04:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
hope that you'll look forward you look
 
04:54:58.670 --> 04:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
you'll look upon this legislation
 
04:55:00.110 --> 04:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
favorably and give it a favorable
 
04:55:02.430 --> 04:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
consideration and that's my testimony Mr
 
04:55:02.440 --> 04:55:04.070 align:start position:0%
consideration and that's my testimony Mr
chair

04:55:04.070 --> 04:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:55:06.030 --> 04:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mlan I think
 
04:55:07.390 --> 04:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
that's the first time I've ever heard
 
04:55:09.070 --> 04:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
Bob Barker's name mentioned in
 
04:55:09.080 --> 04:55:10.548 align:start position:0%
Bob Barker's name mentioned in
legislative

04:55:10.548 --> 04:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
04:55:13.750 --> 04:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
Administration um with that uh willing
 
04:55:15.670 --> 04:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
to take questions if there are any yes
 
04:55:18.990 --> 04:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes um do we have
 
04:55:26.430 --> 04:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:28.990 --> 04:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
jot can you turn on your microphone
 
04:55:31.548 --> 04:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
please thank you I kind of
 
04:55:34.070 --> 04:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
want I'm wondering what would happen if
 
04:55:36.788 --> 04:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
you put the American flag at half flag
 
04:55:38.708 --> 04:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
the flag pole isn't tall enough and the
 
04:55:40.590 --> 04:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
bottom flag if you add that flag on the
 
04:55:44.230 --> 04:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
bottom it's going to be Dragon well um
 
04:55:47.708 --> 04:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
the the the bill says the flag may be
 
04:55:49.868 --> 04:55:49.878 align:start position:0%
flown so again that's just a discretion
 
04:55:52.670 --> 04:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
of leadership the bill also explicitly
 
04:55:55.230 --> 04:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
states that the flag will be flown in a
 
04:55:57.430 --> 04:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
position that is subordinate to every
 
04:55:59.990 --> 04:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
other flag and that includes the P flag
 
04:56:02.990 --> 04:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
so it would be flown beneath that so um
 
04:56:03.000 --> 04:56:03.910 align:start position:0%
so it would be flown beneath that so um
if

04:56:03.910 --> 04:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:56:07.110 --> 04:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh something was going to be uh flown at
 
04:56:10.030 --> 04:56:10.040 align:start position:0%
half mass for example um that may not be
 
04:56:12.150 --> 04:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
the time to do it or perhaps under the
 
04:56:14.230 --> 04:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances of what was behind it
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be flown that would be at
 
04:56:18.750 --> 04:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
the discretion of uh of legislative
 
04:56:21.350 --> 04:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
leadership how they would pull that
 
04:56:24.708 --> 04:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
off representative Richards thank you uh
 
04:56:26.430 --> 04:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:56:29.230 --> 04:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
question um the in line four it says may
 
04:56:31.788 --> 04:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
be displayed above the state house and
 
04:56:35.430 --> 04:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
conquered um are you open to um the
 
04:56:36.670 --> 04:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
potential of
 
04:56:40.910 --> 04:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
other flag polls on State House
 
04:56:44.548 --> 04:56:44.558 align:start position:0%
grounds um it's my understanding that um
 
04:56:47.390 --> 04:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
it's already possible for it to be flown
 
04:56:48.948 --> 04:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
at other areas in the State House
 
04:56:51.390 --> 04:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
grounds I don't think you need I don't
 
04:56:53.548 --> 04:56:53.558 align:start position:0%
I'm don't quote me in this but I don't
 
04:56:56.350 --> 04:56:56.360 align:start position:0%
think that there is a uh a statutory
 
04:56:58.788 --> 04:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
requirement for it to be flown elsewhere
 
04:57:00.750 --> 04:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
um so that we would prefer it to be
 
04:57:03.350 --> 04:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
flown from the dome but I think it can't
 
04:57:04.990 --> 04:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
be flown and you can maybe double check
 
04:57:06.990 --> 04:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:57:10.390 --> 04:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
um uh I don't I I don't think that there
 
04:57:13.948 --> 04:57:13.958 align:start position:0%
is a requirement for other flags on the
 
04:57:16.948 --> 04:57:16.958 align:start position:0%
grounds to be listed in statute I don't
 
04:57:18.708 --> 04:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
believe but I'm not certain I can get
 
04:57:19.590 --> 04:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
04:57:23.510 --> 04:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:26.830 --> 04:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
out representative sellers thank you Mr
 
04:57:28.948 --> 04:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
chair so we're looking at line six here
 
04:57:31.788 --> 04:57:31.798 align:start position:0%
as well it says the flag uh shall be
 
04:57:33.990 --> 04:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
flown immediately
 
04:57:36.910 --> 04:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
below the flag of the United States so
 
04:57:38.788 --> 04:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
you got a contradiction I think going on
 
04:57:41.750 --> 04:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
here because the lower it's it gives an
 
04:57:45.390 --> 04:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
order but but then in Roman two it says
 
04:57:47.150 --> 04:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
if a state flag or other flag will be
 
04:57:50.430 --> 04:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
flown of the on the same Flag Staff
 
04:57:52.628 --> 04:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
meaning that's the same Flag Staff as
 
04:57:54.590 --> 04:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
the United States flag the order from
 
04:57:56.390 --> 04:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
top to bottom shall be the United States
 
04:57:59.750 --> 04:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
flag then the state flag or other flag
 
04:58:01.390 --> 04:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
you know which would be in this case the
 
04:58:03.590 --> 04:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire the P flag than
 
04:58:06.628 --> 04:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
the mental health flag so um if other
 
04:58:08.830 --> 04:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
flags are flown Roman 2 very clearly
 
04:58:11.708 --> 04:58:11.718 align:start position:0%
states um the order of
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
precedents representative
 
04:58:16.390 --> 04:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
followup yeah thank you Mr here one
 
04:58:19.270 --> 04:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
other question is so this is one flag
 
04:58:23.230 --> 04:58:23.240 align:start position:0%
out of we could have hundreds of flags
 
04:58:25.670 --> 04:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
we could run out of space on the pole
 
04:58:29.230 --> 04:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
and space in the number days in the year
 
04:58:31.110 --> 04:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
what are we to
 
04:58:34.628 --> 04:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
do again though I think think
 
04:58:34.638 --> 04:58:36.470 align:start position:0%
do again though I think think
um

04:58:36.470 --> 04:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:41.510 --> 04:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
this in order to have a flag
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
um achieve statutory approval it would
 
04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
have to go through the entire
 
04:58:51.390 --> 04:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
legislature so um you would need to have
 
04:58:54.868 --> 04:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
strong consensus as to this is something
 
04:58:59.670 --> 04:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
that merits um is worthy of that so for
 
04:59:01.190 --> 04:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
example you know you might you might
 
04:59:03.390 --> 04:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
have you know motorcycles of America who
 
04:59:07.070 --> 04:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
are a great organization um but if they
 
04:59:08.590 --> 04:59:08.600 align:start position:0%
were brought before the legislature
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
would there really be enough consensus
 
04:59:12.670 --> 04:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
within the legislature to say yeah I
 
04:59:15.270 --> 04:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
mean that's a that's a fine flag we like
 
04:59:17.350 --> 04:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
those folks but do we really want to
 
04:59:19.430 --> 04:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
give statutory approval to something
 
04:59:22.070 --> 04:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
like that so I think what I'm asking the
 
04:59:23.868 --> 04:59:23.878 align:start position:0%
question that I'm asking the committee
 
04:59:27.910 --> 04:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
is is the issue of uh mental health and
 
04:59:30.590 --> 04:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
mental health awareness does it go high
 
04:59:34.190 --> 04:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
enough up on the bar that it would Merit
 
04:59:36.470 --> 04:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
that approval because you're right um
 
04:59:38.590 --> 04:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
but I believe that the legislative
 
04:59:40.430 --> 04:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
process will act as a very effective
 
04:59:42.628 --> 04:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
filter and the question for you folks is
 
04:59:44.910 --> 04:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
does this meet that measure I believe it
 
04:59:48.070 --> 04:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
does and I hope you will as
 
04:59:48.080 --> 04:59:52.830 align:start position:0%
does and I hope you will as
well

04:59:52.830 --> 04:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:57.470 --> 04:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
good followup uh representative Richards
 
05:00:02.510 --> 05:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
in the physical issues of the flag poll
 
05:00:05.310 --> 05:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
the L L of the flag pole and the number
 
05:00:08.470 --> 05:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
of flags and the increasing days of half
 
05:00:12.270 --> 05:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
staff days um that I have witnessed in
 
05:00:15.830 --> 05:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
the last six years I'm doing square
 
05:00:20.150 --> 05:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
footage math and I'm asking the question
 
05:00:22.070 --> 05:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
of all of us in the
 
05:00:25.390 --> 05:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
committee if we were to say as I would
 
05:00:28.510 --> 05:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
want to say that this does
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
Merit um that statutory there would need
 
05:00:33.510 --> 05:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
to be a fiscal note
 
05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
because there would be a physical have
 
05:00:38.868 --> 05:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
to be a physical potential change at the
 
05:00:41.310 --> 05:00:41.320 align:start position:0%
top of the State House dome for the
 
05:00:47.030 --> 05:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:51.430 --> 05:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:51.440 --> 05:00:53.548 align:start position:0%
 
I

05:00:53.548 --> 05:00:53.558 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:00:57.868 --> 05:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm unaware of how much room is left
 
05:01:01.830 --> 05:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
on the flag pole itself so um if this
 
05:01:06.470 --> 05:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
was to pass into law um then maybe that
 
05:01:08.190 --> 05:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
would be a consideration that would have
 
05:01:10.990 --> 05:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
to be reviewed um but I I to be honest
 
05:01:12.190 --> 05:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
with you I don't know how much room is
 
05:01:14.548 --> 05:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
left on the flag pole
 
05:01:18.990 --> 05:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
so I think we're good right um
 
05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony uh we have two
 
05:01:25.868 --> 05:01:25.878 align:start position:0%
other pink cards and probably more
 
05:01:27.948 --> 05:01:27.958 align:start position:0%

Southern New Hampshire University I'm
 
05:02:52.430 --> 05:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
here because I want to end the stigma
 
05:02:53.990 --> 05:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
surrounding mental illness because
 
05:02:56.350 --> 05:02:56.360 align:start position:0%
mental health is Health uh when people
 
05:02:58.470 --> 05:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
are diagnosed with cancer family and
 
05:03:00.590 --> 05:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
friends walk to the person's side to
 
05:03:03.190 --> 05:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
support them mental illness is almost
 
05:03:05.070 --> 05:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
invisible it's hard to
 
05:03:08.470 --> 05:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
see and until someone speaks up and asks
 
05:03:11.470 --> 05:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
for help when people are diagnosed with
 
05:03:13.430 --> 05:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
a mental disorder such as anxiety or
 
05:03:15.788 --> 05:03:15.798 align:start position:0%
depression our friends our family they
 
05:03:19.150 --> 05:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
just don't understand snap out of it
 
05:03:20.670 --> 05:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
you're not pushing yourself enough
 
05:03:23.628 --> 05:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
you're faking you're doing it for the
 
05:03:26.110 --> 05:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
attention imagine asking for help and
 
05:03:27.510 --> 05:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
you got that
 
05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
response would you reach out again
 
05:03:32.430 --> 05:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
mental illness is treated like a death
 
05:03:33.990 --> 05:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
sent sentence that is
 
05:03:36.788 --> 05:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
contagious our n our natural supports
 
05:03:40.150 --> 05:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
disappear and we were are left alone to
 
05:03:42.628 --> 05:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
suffer imagine if these things were said
 
05:03:45.470 --> 05:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
to someone with a broken leg or a better
 
05:03:46.990 --> 05:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
example would be someone with diabetes
 
05:03:49.708 --> 05:03:49.718 align:start position:0%
since it's pretty invisible to the
 
05:03:52.510 --> 05:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
outside you're not pushing yourself get
 
05:03:56.548 --> 05:03:56.558 align:start position:0%
up you're faking it you're doing it for
 
05:03:56.558 --> 05:03:58.390 align:start position:0%
up you're faking it you're doing it for
attention

05:03:58.390 --> 05:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
attention
 
05:04:01.628 --> 05:04:01.638 align:start position:0%
yikes um just because you can't see it
 
05:04:03.390 --> 05:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that someone isn't
 
05:04:06.470 --> 05:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
suffering with the right support such as
 
05:04:08.350 --> 05:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
counselors prescribers family and
 
05:04:10.150 --> 05:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
friends a person suffering from a
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
diagnosis can live a full and meaningful
 
05:04:15.150 --> 05:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
life because mental health is Health the
 
05:04:16.948 --> 05:04:16.958 align:start position:0%
origins of this flag began with the
 
05:04:18.868 --> 05:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
Jones family they created the Pete
 
05:04:20.868 --> 05:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
Foundation after the Beloved Pete took
 
05:04:23.910 --> 05:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
his life at the age of 23 it was a day
 
05:04:25.868 --> 05:04:25.878 align:start position:0%
of tragedy and disbelief that so many
 
05:04:28.230 --> 05:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
families around the world have endured
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
they decided to invest their efforts
 
05:04:31.868 --> 05:04:31.878 align:start position:0%
towards ensuring that no person would
 
05:04:33.910 --> 05:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
have to suffer silently in the way that
 
05:04:36.990 --> 05:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
Pete did it struck them that Pete was
 
05:04:38.670 --> 05:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
only able to convey the depth of his
 
05:04:40.910 --> 05:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
pain in a letter that he left
 
05:04:44.310 --> 05:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
behind I have given these flag pin to my
 
05:04:46.910 --> 05:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
clients and we use the colors to gauge
 
05:04:48.788 --> 05:04:48.798 align:start position:0%
where they are one day my client will be
 
05:04:52.230 --> 05:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
like I'm yellow today I I'm so happy and
 
05:04:54.230 --> 05:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
then another day they'll be like I'm
 
05:04:56.708 --> 05:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
feeling a little dark green today but I
 
05:04:59.150 --> 05:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
know it's not forever the colors of the
 
05:05:01.070 --> 05:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
flag have meaning the green represents
 
05:05:02.750 --> 05:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
the color of mental health support and
 
05:05:05.110 --> 05:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
varying shades of green and yellow which
 
05:05:06.590 --> 05:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
represent coming out of the darkness
 
05:05:09.628 --> 05:05:09.638 align:start position:0%
into the sunlight I wear the PIN on my
 
05:05:12.030 --> 05:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
jacket as a reminder I get approached
 
05:05:14.110 --> 05:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
daily by strangers in the community that
 
05:05:16.750 --> 05:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
ask about its significance I draw
 
05:05:19.110 --> 05:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
attention it draws attention because we
 
05:05:20.990 --> 05:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
are all acutely aware of these small
 
05:05:22.708 --> 05:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
gestures of support for something that
 
05:05:25.310 --> 05:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
have a deeper meaning now imagine what
 
05:05:27.150 --> 05:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
impact it would have flying above our
 
05:05:29.670 --> 05:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
state housee it must be important
 
05:05:32.270 --> 05:05:32.280 align:start position:0%

States after the war he started the
 
05:06:50.628 --> 05:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
Social Security Administration and one
 
05:06:52.510 --> 05:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
evening in
 
05:06:56.510 --> 05:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
1947 he took his own life and for more
 
05:07:00.110 --> 05:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
than 60 years we covered all of his
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
worldwide accomplishments because of a
 
05:07:05.350 --> 05:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
single moment in time when he was
 
05:07:07.350 --> 05:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
suffering from depression and thought
 
05:07:10.030 --> 05:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
there was no way out of the green and
 
05:07:11.430 --> 05:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
into the
 
05:07:14.990 --> 05:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
sunlight we we honor this man today
 
05:07:16.830 --> 05:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
because we finally have gotten to a
 
05:07:19.230 --> 05:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
point in our society where we can
 
05:07:21.670 --> 05:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
recognize a moment in time does not
 
05:07:23.430 --> 05:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
define an
 
05:07:27.110 --> 05:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
individual the collective efforts of
 
05:07:29.830 --> 05:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
both sides of the house and the Senate
 
05:07:32.510 --> 05:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
and the governor supported the stat stat
 
05:07:34.390 --> 05:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
of John Gilbert weet because we wanted
 
05:07:36.030 --> 05:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
to send a greater message to our
 
05:07:39.030 --> 05:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
community which was we're all here to
 
05:07:40.510 --> 05:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
support each other and you're not going
 
05:07:43.470 --> 05:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
to be buried under one moment in time so
 
05:07:45.590 --> 05:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
I would hope that our legislators on
 
05:07:47.708 --> 05:07:47.718 align:start position:0%
both sides will come together for this
 
05:07:50.030 --> 05:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
issue to raise the mental health flag
 
05:07:52.910 --> 05:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
and stop hiding what needs to be out in
 
05:07:55.910 --> 05:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
the open to help as representative mclan
 
05:07:57.788 --> 05:07:57.798 align:start position:0%

addiction um any mental health dis
 
05:08:05.110 --> 05:08:05.120 align:start position:0%

thank you we we're glad to answer any
 
05:08:20.948 --> 05:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
questions that was a remarkable
 
05:08:26.910 --> 05:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:30.350 --> 05:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
committee see I have one yes
 
05:08:35.030 --> 05:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
um the flag um a who pays for it how
 
05:08:38.270 --> 05:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
does it get here um is it privately
 
05:08:41.708 --> 05:08:41.718 align:start position:0%
owned is it uh is it a trademarked um
 
05:08:45.110 --> 05:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
item and and what does it
 
05:08:48.590 --> 05:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
do being on the flying over the State
 
05:08:52.030 --> 05:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
House versus anywhere else or any other
 
05:08:54.708 --> 05:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
type of project that makes mental
 
05:08:54.718 --> 05:08:55.708 align:start position:0%
type of project that makes mental
illness

05:08:55.708 --> 05:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
illness
 
05:08:59.310 --> 05:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
more available to us I can answer part
 
05:09:02.350 --> 05:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
of that so with the Pete Foundation it's
 
05:09:05.030 --> 05:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
not trademarked or anything like that um
 
05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
it ALS they also will donate to any
 
05:09:10.230 --> 05:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
state that wants to fly it above their
 
05:09:12.230 --> 05:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
state house um I believe in the handout
 
05:09:13.948 --> 05:09:13.958 align:start position:0%
there's a picture of it flying over the
 
05:09:15.110 --> 05:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
state of
 
05:09:17.270 --> 05:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
Kentucky um and then what was the third
 
05:09:19.868 --> 05:09:19.878 align:start position:0%
question so the other part is that um
 
05:09:21.708 --> 05:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
here in the city of conquered with the
 
05:09:24.150 --> 05:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
support of Riverbend the coalition to
 
05:09:26.868 --> 05:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
end homelessness and your state hospital
 
05:09:29.788 --> 05:09:29.798 align:start position:0%
they flew the flag or displayed the flag
 
05:09:31.750 --> 05:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
not everybody had flag poles at their
 
05:09:31.760 --> 05:09:32.788 align:start position:0%
not everybody had flag poles at their
location

05:09:32.788 --> 05:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
location
 
05:09:35.390 --> 05:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
they did that last May for us because of
 
05:09:36.948 --> 05:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
this effort to go through the
 
05:09:39.788 --> 05:09:39.798 align:start position:0%
legislature to ask um the legislator to
 
05:09:42.110 --> 05:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
fly at the State House So within the
 
05:09:44.110 --> 05:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
city of conquered because this is where
 
05:09:46.670 --> 05:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
we reside we reached out to our Network
 
05:09:48.628 --> 05:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
to have them at least start spreading
 
05:09:51.030 --> 05:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
the word so that we could do that also
 
05:09:53.750 --> 05:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
in a conversation with our city manager
 
05:09:55.868 --> 05:09:55.878 align:start position:0%
um there is an application process if
 
05:09:58.708 --> 05:09:58.718 align:start position:0%
you wanted to display a flag down Main
 
05:10:01.390 --> 05:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
Street so if we had mental health Flags
 
05:10:04.030 --> 05:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
um it is an application process there
 
05:10:06.270 --> 05:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
are multiple organizations that already
 
05:10:08.510 --> 05:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
sign that application year-over-year and
 
05:10:11.230 --> 05:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
there is no space for us and so this is
 
05:10:13.150 --> 05:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
the direction that we came in we think
 
05:10:15.230 --> 05:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
that the state house um being more
 
05:10:17.390 --> 05:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
prevalent and having that higher voice
 
05:10:20.150 --> 05:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
across the entire State sends a much Lou
 
05:10:23.670 --> 05:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
louder message than just the city of
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
conquer great thank you very much for
 
05:10:28.990 --> 05:10:29.000 align:start position:0%

05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%

05:10:44.670 --> 05:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
worldwide good the mental health flag
 
05:10:47.310 --> 05:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
itself is a dark green this is a takeoff
 
05:10:49.750 --> 05:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
on that that actually shows the shade so
 
05:10:51.510 --> 05:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
that people that are suffering from
 
05:10:54.590 --> 05:10:54.600 align:start position:0%

long day for you but that's okay you
 
05:14:51.510 --> 05:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't have a flag though right we don't
 
05:14:56.990 --> 05:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
have a flag all right on on what I am
 
05:15:02.310 --> 05:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
attempting to do is to let a legisl
 
05:15:08.990 --> 05:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
study committee fashion uh a home
 
05:15:12.150 --> 05:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
and a method of
 
05:15:14.590 --> 05:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
choosing research
 
05:15:17.150 --> 05:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
projects that would
 
05:15:22.110 --> 05:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
be uh most useful to the legislators
 
05:15:25.590 --> 05:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
I've suggested that there be a group
 
05:15:30.548 --> 05:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
like the one that deals with
 
05:15:30.558 --> 05:15:36.390 align:start position:0%
like the one that deals with
um

05:15:36.390 --> 05:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:40.310 --> 05:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
um um with
 
05:15:40.320 --> 05:15:42.270 align:start position:0%
um um with
the

05:15:42.270 --> 05:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:15:45.830 --> 05:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
the I'm sorry I forget words sometimes
 
05:15:48.548 --> 05:15:48.558 align:start position:0%
today now
 
05:15:48.558 --> 05:15:50.590 align:start position:0%
today now
um

05:15:50.590 --> 05:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:55.230 --> 05:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
yeah uh that it decides which of various
 
05:15:58.948 --> 05:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
uh departments are going to be
 
05:16:06.190 --> 05:16:06.200 align:start position:0%
on picked um to get a uh analysis of
 
05:16:08.788 --> 05:16:08.798 align:start position:0%
their um
 
05:16:10.670 --> 05:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
functionality and I'm sorry I'm
 
05:16:13.670 --> 05:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
forgetting that word right now but um
 
05:16:17.110 --> 05:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
and it consists of Republicans and
 
05:16:18.948 --> 05:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
Democrats I'm
 
05:16:22.548 --> 05:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
suggesting equal Republicans and
 
05:16:25.510 --> 05:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
Democrats so that there would always
 
05:16:29.270 --> 05:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
have to be agreement on these things um
 
05:16:32.270 --> 05:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
but what it is for
 
05:16:33.788 --> 05:16:33.798 align:start position:0%
is to
 
05:16:37.430 --> 05:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
employ data and economic data analysis
 
05:16:41.628 --> 05:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
within the legislature to chart out the
 
05:16:44.830 --> 05:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
probable impacts of major changes before
 
05:16:47.788 --> 05:16:47.798 align:start position:0%
we commit to them
 
05:16:51.270 --> 05:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
um and there's a side issue being from
 
05:16:55.990 --> 05:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
the Ways and Means Committee on we
 
05:16:59.708 --> 05:16:59.718 align:start position:0%
have a couple of us in a bipartisan
 
05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
agreement that there should not just be
 
05:17:02.160 --> 05:17:03.670 align:start position:0%
agreement that there should not just be
static

05:17:03.670 --> 05:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
static
 
05:17:06.590 --> 05:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
analysis uh to create Revenue
 
05:17:10.230 --> 05:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
estimates that we need some way of
 
05:17:12.948 --> 05:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
trying to look into the
 
05:17:12.958 --> 05:17:14.470 align:start position:0%
trying to look into the
future

05:17:14.470 --> 05:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:17:17.868 --> 05:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
and we have the Department of Revenue
 
05:17:20.430 --> 05:17:20.440 align:start position:0%
Administration which I thoroughly
 
05:17:23.628 --> 05:17:23.638 align:start position:0%
approve of using static analysis to make
 
05:17:26.868 --> 05:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates but these estimates
 
05:17:29.708 --> 05:17:29.718 align:start position:0%
are based on confirmed data sets some of
 
05:17:31.948 --> 05:17:31.958 align:start position:0%
which are 2 to 3 years old
 
05:17:35.350 --> 05:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
our most important taxes uh are
 
05:17:38.788 --> 05:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
estimated that way because the business
 
05:17:41.470 --> 05:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
taxes have to go through
 
05:17:45.150 --> 05:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
audit before they're confirmed and so
 
05:17:47.910 --> 05:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
the numbers are two or three years old
 
05:17:50.910 --> 05:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
that they are using on they then make
 
05:17:53.150 --> 05:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
their best guess of how far off their
 
05:17:57.070 --> 05:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
estimates may be and uh in times like
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
this the estimate ranges are kind of
 
05:18:00.320 --> 05:18:02.070 align:start position:0%
this the estimate ranges are kind of
broad

05:18:02.070 --> 05:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
broad
 
05:18:05.030 --> 05:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
extremely Broad
 
05:18:05.040 --> 05:18:06.910 align:start position:0%
extremely Broad
and

05:18:06.910 --> 05:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:18:11.390 --> 05:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
on then they do a very good job but I
 
05:18:13.708 --> 05:18:13.718 align:start position:0%
feel that having a second look at this
 
05:18:16.390 --> 05:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
through multivariat longitudinal
 
05:18:18.830 --> 05:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
analysis would improve our committee's
 
05:18:21.628 --> 05:18:21.638 align:start position:0%
work and likely reduce the major
 
05:18:24.150 --> 05:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
surprises we have when recessions or
 
05:18:26.390 --> 05:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
growth spurts are cor
 
05:18:30.830 --> 05:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
occur um we have a member of RA and
 
05:18:32.350 --> 05:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
means that that's been there almost as
 
05:18:35.548 --> 05:18:35.558 align:start position:0%
long as I have Jordan oler who is
 
05:18:38.910 --> 05:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
continuously bringing up we need to do
 
05:18:42.948 --> 05:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
Dynamic analysis and this is actually
 
05:18:45.788 --> 05:18:45.798 align:start position:0%
pretty close to what he's talking about
 
05:18:49.990 --> 05:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
but it's based in an economic
 
05:18:52.350 --> 05:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
methodology that's been developing since
 
05:18:52.360 --> 05:18:53.910 align:start position:0%
methodology that's been developing since
the

05:18:53.910 --> 05:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:18:53.920 --> 05:18:55.990 align:start position:0%
the
1950s

05:18:55.990 --> 05:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
1950s
 
05:18:59.190 --> 05:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
um I want to take you back about 15
 
05:19:01.030 --> 05:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
years to the first time that a push was
 
05:19:03.910 --> 05:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
made to spend money to provide dental
 
05:19:07.628 --> 05:19:07.638 align:start position:0%
care for lower inome adults in New
 
05:19:11.150 --> 05:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it took about 15 years to
 
05:19:15.110 --> 05:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
pass because and we had two arguments
 
05:19:20.510 --> 05:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
going on uh one of them is that it costs
 
05:19:23.350 --> 05:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
too much and we have no idea whether
 
05:19:25.708 --> 05:19:25.718 align:start position:0%
we're going to get our money back in the
 
05:19:29.430 --> 05:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
future um the other one was that we are
 
05:19:32.788 --> 05:19:32.798 align:start position:0%
keeping people on the public D because
 
05:19:35.788 --> 05:19:35.798 align:start position:0%
their mouths are rotting out they
 
05:19:41.030 --> 05:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
smell um they in in the situation a
 
05:19:43.670 --> 05:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
number of adults find themselves in who
 
05:19:48.070 --> 05:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
began life in poverty and and with
 
05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
difficult without any Dental Care
 
05:19:55.310 --> 05:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um it's one of the big things
 
05:19:58.590 --> 05:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
that keeps them from getting jobs that
 
05:20:01.548 --> 05:20:01.558 align:start position:0%
will support themselves and it's one of
 
05:20:04.190 --> 05:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
the big things that keeps that section
 
05:20:06.990 --> 05:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
of our labor force out of the labor
 
05:20:10.310 --> 05:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
force and at this point we need as many
 
05:20:14.230 --> 05:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
people as we can get in all levels of
 
05:20:17.990 --> 05:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
jobs so
 
05:20:18.000 --> 05:20:19.670 align:start position:0%
jobs so
um

05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:23.310 --> 05:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
the the question is which of these is
 
05:20:27.310 --> 05:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:29.868 --> 05:20:29.878 align:start position:0%
happen and there's another one that we
 
05:20:31.670 --> 05:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
are facing right now
 
05:20:34.830 --> 05:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
which is if we invest more money in
 
05:20:37.070 --> 05:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
child care and it's going to need quite
 
05:20:38.310 --> 05:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
05:20:42.310 --> 05:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
money then um is that going to give us
 
05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
enough more people in the labor force
 
05:20:52.788 --> 05:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:55.788 --> 05:20:55.798 align:start position:0%
on Prosper as much as it has been
 
05:20:57.430 --> 05:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
prospering in the
 
05:20:57.440 --> 05:20:59.470 align:start position:0%
prospering in the
past

05:20:59.470 --> 05:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
past
 
05:21:03.030 --> 05:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh when
 
05:21:05.230 --> 05:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
uh and what kinds of child care if we
 
05:21:07.230 --> 05:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
just had child care that would leave a
 
05:21:10.230 --> 05:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
cou leave kids in somebody else's hands
 
05:21:13.270 --> 05:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
while both parents go work
 
05:21:16.270 --> 05:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
um how much would we get out of that if
 
05:21:20.430 --> 05:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
we if we provided appropriate preschool
 
05:21:23.350 --> 05:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
preparation for kada 12 so that the
 
05:21:25.670 --> 05:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
children could hit the ground running
 
05:21:28.190 --> 05:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
when they get into regular
 
05:21:28.200 --> 05:21:29.830 align:start position:0%
when they get into regular
schools

05:21:29.830 --> 05:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:21:33.470 --> 05:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
um how how much would that do is it
 
05:21:36.590 --> 05:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
worth what we'd have to sacrifice in
 
05:21:40.070 --> 05:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
other areas in order to pay for that and
 
05:21:44.310 --> 05:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
these are both kind of long-term issues
 
05:21:47.270 --> 05:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
that we may be arguing about within
 
05:21:50.310 --> 05:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
ourselves and with each other about for
 
05:21:54.150 --> 05:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
years before like dental care we finally
 
05:21:57.350 --> 05:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
bite the bullet and do it
 
05:21:59.948 --> 05:21:59.958 align:start position:0%
um I'm a socio
 
05:22:02.510 --> 05:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
economist I both taught economic
 
05:22:05.070 --> 05:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
research methods and I experimented with
 
05:22:08.948 --> 05:22:08.958 align:start position:0%
their Tools in my pre pre-legislative
 
05:22:11.910 --> 05:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
career which was 25 years
 
05:22:14.868 --> 05:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
long I'm now that's why I forget things
 
05:22:15.868 --> 05:22:15.878 align:start position:0%
I'm getting
 
05:22:19.670 --> 05:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
old um multivariate analysis has been a
 
05:22:22.708 --> 05:22:22.718 align:start position:0%
major part of the economist's toolbox it
 
05:22:26.070 --> 05:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
allows the users to weigh a number of
 
05:22:28.868 --> 05:22:28.878 align:start position:0%
possible factors influencing an outcome
 
05:22:31.990 --> 05:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
such as greater net revenue and decide
 
05:22:35.150 --> 05:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
which of them are most important to
 
05:22:38.150 --> 05:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
creating that Revenue American
 
05:22:39.750 --> 05:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
economists began working with
 
05:22:42.030 --> 05:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
multivariate analysis in the
 
05:22:45.628 --> 05:22:45.638 align:start position:0%
mid-50s 1950s but for many years they
 
05:22:48.990 --> 05:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
were severely limited by their data they
 
05:22:51.270 --> 05:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
simply didn't know how to quantify a lot
 
05:22:54.830 --> 05:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
of the factors that do influence the
 
05:22:58.430 --> 05:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
results uh as computers progressed and
 
05:23:00.670 --> 05:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
as the economists began to incorporate
 
05:23:03.470 --> 05:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
the work of other social scientists and
 
05:23:05.590 --> 05:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
to quantify the factors they found
 
05:23:07.990 --> 05:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
important their results have gotten a
 
05:23:08.000 --> 05:23:08.830 align:start position:0%
important their results have gotten a
lot

05:23:08.830 --> 05:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
lot
 
05:23:12.190 --> 05:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
better um they can't predict the future
 
05:23:15.788 --> 05:23:15.798 align:start position:0%
completely nobody can but they're doing
 
05:23:18.030 --> 05:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
better A lot better at it than when I
 
05:23:18.040 --> 05:23:19.430 align:start position:0%
better A lot better at it than when I
was

05:23:19.430 --> 05:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:23:22.990 --> 05:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
young uh we have a longtime user of
 
05:23:25.310 --> 05:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
multivariate analysis here in the
 
05:23:28.110 --> 05:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Employment Security his
 
05:23:31.310 --> 05:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
name is Brian godlo for a long time he
 
05:23:34.310 --> 05:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
was he is a very strong Republican by
 
05:23:39.150 --> 05:23:39.160 align:start position:0%
the way uh for a long time he was in as
 
05:23:42.708 --> 05:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
a so working as a solo operator and
 
05:23:47.150 --> 05:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
doing um analyses for various lobbying
 
05:23:52.310 --> 05:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
groups and for um businesses and such
 
05:23:56.150 --> 05:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
and I've always been impressed with his
 
05:23:59.310 --> 05:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
insights he's now working with a model
 
05:24:02.310 --> 05:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
that was set up over 40 years years ago
 
05:24:06.708 --> 05:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
uh when Regional economic models Inc
 
05:24:09.990 --> 05:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise Remy was
 
05:24:13.510 --> 05:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
created The Economist that started that
 
05:24:17.190 --> 05:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
model is still there and they have
 
05:24:21.670 --> 05:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
been improving the model for 40 years
 
05:24:25.470 --> 05:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
it's quite impressive it's used by state
 
05:24:28.230 --> 05:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
governments from Utah to Massachusetts
 
05:24:30.350 --> 05:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
to help them to decide how to make their
 
05:24:32.030 --> 05:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
economy enies and governments more
 
05:24:35.868 --> 05:24:35.878 align:start position:0%
efficient and more serviceable to their
 
05:24:40.990 --> 05:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
people and they are here
 
05:24:44.430 --> 05:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
uh but I did say help them decide
 
05:24:47.030 --> 05:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's always politics involved in what
 
05:24:49.990 --> 05:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
any state decides to do and this is only
 
05:24:52.590 --> 05:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
one contribution to that no matter how
 
05:24:54.390 --> 05:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
sophisticated the model is there will
 
05:24:56.708 --> 05:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
always be factors not yet considered
 
05:24:59.910 --> 05:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
that can upend it uh the group that
 
05:25:03.030 --> 05:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
created the model advises its clients of
 
05:25:05.670 --> 05:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
this fact and provides an outside view
 
05:25:08.110 --> 05:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
of the results that we are likely to see
 
05:25:11.628 --> 05:25:11.638 align:start position:0%
five 10 or 20 years ahead if we make a
 
05:25:16.190 --> 05:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
certain change now or we don't make
 
05:25:21.270 --> 05:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
it uh members of uh that group are that
 
05:25:24.030 --> 05:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
are present are Dr Peter
 
05:25:29.190 --> 05:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
evangelicas and Chris Judson who is um
 
05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
at Kent tell us about the administration
 
05:25:35.310 --> 05:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
of Remy I'm using Remy because it's the
 
05:25:39.150 --> 05:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
only one I know that I really
 
05:25:42.910 --> 05:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
um and have ever been close enough to to
 
05:25:46.070 --> 05:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
respect uh there may be others and
 
05:25:49.708 --> 05:25:49.718 align:start position:0%
that's why the bill is written so that
 
05:25:53.070 --> 05:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
it would require uh if it
 
05:25:56.750 --> 05:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
goes comes through this committee and
 
05:25:59.590 --> 05:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
gets a legislative study committee and
 
05:26:02.948 --> 05:26:02.958 align:start position:0%
creates um a
 
05:26:02.958 --> 05:26:05.390 align:start position:0%
creates um a
a

05:26:05.390 --> 05:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:26:10.350 --> 05:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
um a request for a bit bids it will have
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
probably more than than one bid but
 
05:26:23.270 --> 05:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh I Remy really has the longest
 
05:26:29.628 --> 05:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
reputation of any and the most wide uh
 
05:26:33.670 --> 05:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh National reputation of anybody that
 
05:26:36.270 --> 05:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
that um I've
 
05:26:40.510 --> 05:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
seen also our state's best public data
 
05:26:43.030 --> 05:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
analysts Phil slon from the New
 
05:26:45.628 --> 05:26:45.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fiscal policy Institute and
 
05:26:48.350 --> 05:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
former representative Doug Hall who
 
05:26:50.510 --> 05:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
created the first professional and
 
05:26:53.270 --> 05:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute in
 
05:26:57.390 --> 05:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
our state it fell apart
 
05:27:01.470 --> 05:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh for some fairly
 
05:27:04.708 --> 05:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
difficult personal reasons about 10
 
05:27:07.990 --> 05:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
years ago now I think
 
05:27:11.030 --> 05:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh and the New Hampshire Center for
 
05:27:14.750 --> 05:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
Public Policy studies which was widely
 
05:27:17.948 --> 05:27:17.958 align:start position:0%
used within the legislature to
 
05:27:21.070 --> 05:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
understand uh the facts behind what we
 
05:27:25.350 --> 05:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
were arguing about while it was still in
 
05:27:29.350 --> 05:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
existence um they are here both here to
 
05:27:33.310 --> 05:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
testify unfortun Brian gtlo told me he
 
05:27:35.670 --> 05:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
might have to be at
 
05:27:38.830 --> 05:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
work and it sounds like that's where he
 
05:27:42.948 --> 05:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
is so
 
05:27:46.390 --> 05:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
on I thank you very much for listening
 
05:27:51.830 --> 05:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh I would like if possible for this
 
05:27:55.510 --> 05:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
bill not only to be passed but to go out
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
to um to the legislature fast enough
 
05:28:03.948 --> 05:28:03.958 align:start position:0%
that we and try to get it to the finance
 
05:28:06.110 --> 05:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
committee so that was going to be my
 
05:28:08.070 --> 05:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
first question if you're willing to take
 
05:28:13.548 --> 05:28:13.558 align:start position:0%
questions yes um my question was
 
05:28:17.548 --> 05:28:17.558 align:start position:0%
um why write this as a study committee
 
05:28:20.510 --> 05:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
and not with your experience in budgets
 
05:28:25.510 --> 05:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
um as such why not just create um a line
 
05:28:25.520 --> 05:28:27.510 align:start position:0%
um as such why not just create um a line
item

05:28:27.510 --> 05:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
item
 
05:28:30.910 --> 05:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
for a proposal um to
 
05:28:33.948 --> 05:28:33.958 align:start position:0%
to grab bids and I'm assuming what
 
05:28:36.708 --> 05:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do is create a Remy U
 
05:28:40.230 --> 05:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
to to something like an inh house how
 
05:28:42.750 --> 05:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
how well re they will explain how Remy
 
05:28:45.510 --> 05:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
works but essentially please don't I
 
05:28:47.990 --> 05:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
hope not they ad they
 
05:28:52.230 --> 05:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
advise uh people selected by the body
 
05:28:57.150 --> 05:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
that is employing them uh to uh that are
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
from here that someone would be working
 
05:29:04.948 --> 05:29:04.958 align:start position:0%
here on using the Remy models and
 
05:29:08.750 --> 05:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
advised by the national group and the
 
05:29:11.110 --> 05:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
group in Amherst
 
05:29:16.230 --> 05:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and uh in in uh the
 
05:29:19.708 --> 05:29:19.718 align:start position:0%
factors that over 40 years they have
 
05:29:22.990 --> 05:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
found pertinent to particular
 
05:29:27.750 --> 05:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
problems uh and but before we get to
 
05:29:30.990 --> 05:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
actually the value of
 
05:29:34.510 --> 05:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
the the service the the process
 
05:29:39.350 --> 05:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
itself um I want to know the the U the
 
05:29:42.670 --> 05:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
nuts and bolts of why you've created
 
05:29:45.750 --> 05:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
this the the way you have
 
05:29:49.750 --> 05:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
including um the the
 
05:29:53.110 --> 05:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
extensive um laundry list of people to
 
05:29:55.990 --> 05:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
be on this committee when it sounds like
 
05:30:00.628 --> 05:30:00.638 align:start position:0%
what you want you already know exists
 
05:30:02.548 --> 05:30:02.558 align:start position:0%
and why you didn't just write it as a
 
05:30:07.750 --> 05:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
bill or or um some kind of a procurement
 
05:30:11.190 --> 05:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
to to put it in place that's my I've
 
05:30:15.510 --> 05:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
discussed this in several places around
 
05:30:19.788 --> 05:30:19.798 align:start position:0%
conquer and um one of the places was the
 
05:30:22.708 --> 05:30:22.718 align:start position:0%
LBA and the lbo
 
05:30:26.070 --> 05:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
said people will buy into it
 
05:30:29.230 --> 05:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
more if they can help write the
 
05:30:33.110 --> 05:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
structure M and frankly also on their
 
05:30:36.110 --> 05:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
variety of places it could be put I
 
05:30:38.270 --> 05:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
would not want to see it in the
 
05:30:40.868 --> 05:30:40.878 align:start position:0%
executive unless it was well protected
 
05:30:43.750 --> 05:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
because every new governor
 
05:30:49.230 --> 05:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
upends the the its own
 
05:30:52.390 --> 05:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
office and so you're seeing this as a
 
05:30:55.470 --> 05:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
legislative office I'm seeing this I
 
05:30:57.390 --> 05:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
would like to see it as a legislative
 
05:31:00.868 --> 05:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
office but they said you better let let
 
05:31:05.390 --> 05:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
them have some more involvement in this
 
05:31:07.190 --> 05:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
well and that gets me to my second
 
05:31:10.910 --> 05:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
question or maybe longer um why why you
 
05:31:12.990 --> 05:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
didn't have a legislator be the chairman
 
05:31:21.110 --> 05:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:23.350 --> 05:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
commission I can't remember at this
 
05:31:27.070 --> 05:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
point that that I did I would it merely
 
05:31:28.628 --> 05:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
says that the members of the commission
 
05:31:30.788 --> 05:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
are going to elect a chair person from
 
05:31:33.270 --> 05:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
among the members but but that makes
 
05:31:37.190 --> 05:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
them one out of uh I don't know um six
 
05:31:42.230 --> 05:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
or eight at least people um so if you
 
05:31:44.430 --> 05:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
want this to be a legislative process I
 
05:31:46.548 --> 05:31:46.558 align:start position:0%
would have thought you would have had
 
05:31:48.708 --> 05:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
the legislature be the
 
05:31:52.548 --> 05:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
chair you wouldn't be adverse to that I
 
05:31:54.590 --> 05:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
guess I wouldn't be adverse to that a
 
05:31:56.830 --> 05:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
legislator is going to be a Democrat or
 
05:31:59.830 --> 05:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
a Republican and I'm hoping to make this
 
05:32:02.788 --> 05:32:02.798 align:start position:0%
to totally nonpartisan numbers are
 
05:32:06.270 --> 05:32:06.280 align:start position:0%
numbers don't know right um any further
 
05:32:06.280 --> 05:32:07.868 align:start position:0%
numbers don't know right um any further
questions

05:32:07.868 --> 05:32:07.878 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:32:13.270 --> 05:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
from okay um well let's hear from from
 
05:32:17.110 --> 05:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
our uh you have picked
 
05:32:23.270 --> 05:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
um Chris and Peter to be testifying
 
05:32:26.628 --> 05:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
together is that correct yes yeah great
 
05:32:27.948 --> 05:32:27.958 align:start position:0%
since there are two welcome to
 
05:32:29.708 --> 05:32:29.718 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration if you could
 
05:32:32.150 --> 05:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
step step up and introduce yourself and
 
05:32:34.590 --> 05:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
tell us where you're from and all that
 
05:32:37.788 --> 05:32:37.798 align:start position:0%
fun stuff um and keep it non-technical
 
05:32:41.270 --> 05:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
that would be even better we do have a
 
05:32:46.390 --> 05:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:49.830 --> 05:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
yep apolog just send some around that
 
05:32:54.110 --> 05:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:56.750 --> 05:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
way oh these are this is
 
05:33:08.590 --> 05:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:10.750 --> 05:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
just supporting information uh with a
 
05:33:13.548 --> 05:33:13.558 align:start position:0%
case study from the Texas legislative
 
05:33:15.990 --> 05:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
budget board on how they Implement a
 
05:33:16.000 --> 05:33:28.948 align:start position:0%
budget board on how they Implement a
similar

05:33:28.948 --> 05:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:28.958 --> 05:33:50.788 align:start position:0%
 
process

05:33:50.788 --> 05:33:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:54.190 --> 05:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
right precisely and Chris Judson manager
 
05:33:56.990 --> 05:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
at Remy uh I also accompanied by Dr
 
05:33:59.390 --> 05:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
Peter evangelakis who will provide the
 
05:34:01.590 --> 05:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
majority of the testimony today but we
 
05:34:04.628 --> 05:34:04.638 align:start position:0%
do agree uh our goal today is just to
 
05:34:07.788 --> 05:34:07.798 align:start position:0%
inform you on how models like ours or
 
05:34:10.670 --> 05:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
are utilized uh by the majority of of
 
05:34:14.070 --> 05:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
legislators and legislative bodies and
 
05:34:16.510 --> 05:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
and similar types of of
 
05:34:18.670 --> 05:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
organizations um
 
05:34:21.390 --> 05:34:21.400 align:start position:0%
and happy to answer your questions uh
 
05:34:27.708 --> 05:34:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:30.510 --> 05:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
you and yes uh Peter evangelo is also
 
05:34:32.830 --> 05:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
with Remy I'm our senior vice president
 
05:34:36.030 --> 05:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
of economics and Consulting um so I'll
 
05:34:37.510 --> 05:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
I'll keep it pretty brief and and
 
05:34:40.510 --> 05:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
non-technical uh I just want to share uh
 
05:34:42.110 --> 05:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
basically you know some of our
 
05:34:44.990 --> 05:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
experiences with clients um who you know
 
05:34:48.750 --> 05:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
who work with uh these these tools um
 
05:34:51.670 --> 05:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
and I think uh a representative Al me
 
05:34:53.990 --> 05:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
said it well when you know it's
 
05:34:57.030 --> 05:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
important especially with uh with major
 
05:35:00.510 --> 05:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
pieces of of of legislation but even
 
05:35:02.510 --> 05:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
potentially with smaller ones to have a
 
05:35:05.430 --> 05:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
good idea of the pros and cons and how
 
05:35:07.350 --> 05:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
they weigh out against each other and
 
05:35:10.750 --> 05:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
that's what our our clients value uh our
 
05:35:12.948 --> 05:35:12.958 align:start position:0%
clients include uh you know legislative
 
05:35:15.590 --> 05:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
bodies Departments of Revenue budget
 
05:35:18.390 --> 05:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
offices uh we're uh we have we're
 
05:35:20.670 --> 05:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
represented across Most states so we
 
05:35:22.230 --> 05:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
have kind of a breadth of experience
 
05:35:24.030 --> 05:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
across many different types of
 
05:35:26.390 --> 05:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
governments um and I just wanted to
 
05:35:29.230 --> 05:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
highlight kind of a few different uh
 
05:35:33.070 --> 05:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
topic are areas where um I think this
 
05:35:34.788 --> 05:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
commission would be interested to study
 
05:35:38.788 --> 05:35:38.798 align:start position:0%
further uh and our experience there um
 
05:35:41.230 --> 05:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
so I'll say you know one you know one
 
05:35:44.070 --> 05:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
area obviously fiscal policy tax policy
 
05:35:46.910 --> 05:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
you know um would certainly be you know
 
05:35:50.590 --> 05:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
you know is a very important piece uh of
 
05:35:52.628 --> 05:35:52.638 align:start position:0%
you know you know you know kind of
 
05:35:54.910 --> 05:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
legislative uh you know the legislative
 
05:35:57.110 --> 05:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
toolkit you know fiscal policy
 
05:35:58.948 --> 05:35:58.958 align:start position:0%
understanding what the impacts of
 
05:36:00.670 --> 05:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
different tax polic policies are changes
 
05:36:03.548 --> 05:36:03.558 align:start position:0%
in tax policy is very important uh we
 
05:36:07.788 --> 05:36:07.798 align:start position:0%
were involved um in 2018 and into 2019
 
05:36:10.430 --> 05:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
with uh Arkansas uh we actually on
 
05:36:13.230 --> 05:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
behalf of their um Bureau of legislative
 
05:36:15.868 --> 05:36:15.878 align:start position:0%
analysis or sorry Bureau of legislative
 
05:36:19.110 --> 05:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
research um we did a study uh put
 
05:36:21.350 --> 05:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
together a number of fiscal notes on a
 
05:36:22.990 --> 05:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
variety of personal and corporate income
 
05:36:26.670 --> 05:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
tax proposals um that we understand were
 
05:36:28.990 --> 05:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
later adopted in some form or another
 
05:36:31.788 --> 05:36:31.798 align:start position:0%
over the next few years uh and so we
 
05:36:34.270 --> 05:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
were brought in to not only to run the
 
05:36:37.070 --> 05:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
study but I was uh uh brought in to
 
05:36:39.110 --> 05:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
testify in front of their legislative
 
05:36:41.670 --> 05:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
task force to speak to the results to
 
05:36:43.390 --> 05:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
help guide their
 
05:36:43.400 --> 05:36:45.030 align:start position:0%
help guide their
deliberations

05:36:45.030 --> 05:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
deliberations
 
05:36:48.708 --> 05:36:48.718 align:start position:0%
um there are um also a variety of
 
05:36:50.788 --> 05:36:50.798 align:start position:0%
clients who look at you know kind of a
 
05:36:54.070 --> 05:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
more specific issue of of tax credits of
 
05:36:56.830 --> 05:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
of All Sorts so we have clients uh for
 
05:37:00.390 --> 05:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
example we did uh uh work with uh
 
05:37:03.070 --> 05:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
Louisiana um you know my my Consulting
 
05:37:06.230 --> 05:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
team did a study for one of our clients
 
05:37:07.830 --> 05:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
there looking at their quality jobs
 
05:37:09.830 --> 05:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
program uh looking at B you know
 
05:37:11.190 --> 05:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
incentives for certain types of
 
05:37:13.868 --> 05:37:13.878 align:start position:0%
businesses and basically understanding
 
05:37:15.230 --> 05:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
what is the you know what are the
 
05:37:17.310 --> 05:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
benefits in terms of jobs and additional
 
05:37:20.110 --> 05:37:20.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue versus you know what are the the
 
05:37:22.548 --> 05:37:22.558 align:start position:0%
costs to the state in terms of offering
 
05:37:24.750 --> 05:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh and we were able to find uh kind of a
 
05:37:27.948 --> 05:37:27.958 align:start position:0%
balance point where um you could make an
 
05:37:30.708 --> 05:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
assessment on both the economic
 
05:37:32.628 --> 05:37:32.638 align:start position:0%
benefit and cost as well as the fiscal
 
05:37:36.190 --> 05:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
benefit and cost um we also have uh
 
05:37:38.110 --> 05:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
clients up in Washington State uh The
 
05:37:39.708 --> 05:37:39.718 align:start position:0%
Joint legislative audit and Review
 
05:37:42.548 --> 05:37:42.558 align:start position:0%
Committee um who are tasked with looking
 
05:37:45.110 --> 05:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
at a you know a wide variety of tax
 
05:37:47.070 --> 05:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
credits uh you know they use the model
 
05:37:49.910 --> 05:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
in-house uh with our support uh and
 
05:37:53.070 --> 05:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
they've looked at uh you know they've
 
05:37:54.948 --> 05:37:54.958 align:start position:0%
used the model for you know well over a
 
05:37:57.350 --> 05:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
decade looking at a wide variety of tax
 
05:38:00.070 --> 05:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
credits and trying to assess
 
05:38:02.310 --> 05:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know which should be maintained
 
05:38:04.470 --> 05:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
which maybe should be retired uh things
 
05:38:08.990 --> 05:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
of that nature so trying to be uh
 
05:38:11.948 --> 05:38:11.958 align:start position:0%
accountable to the
 
05:38:14.548 --> 05:38:14.558 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um a representative Aly also
 
05:38:17.150 --> 05:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh Child Care um you know
 
05:38:18.548 --> 05:38:18.558 align:start position:0%
there have been a couple of studies I
 
05:38:20.990 --> 05:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight one was looking uh
 
05:38:22.510 --> 05:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
this also happened to be in Washington
 
05:38:24.830 --> 05:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
State uh a client of ours looked on
 
05:38:26.990 --> 05:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
behalf of their Department of Commerce
 
05:38:30.030 --> 05:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
at uh uh a policy of of offering
 
05:38:33.110 --> 05:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
subsidies for for child care and looking
 
05:38:35.270 --> 05:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
at the obviously the benefits of that in
 
05:38:38.430 --> 05:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
terms of Labor Force participation um
 
05:38:40.788 --> 05:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
and you know business you know the
 
05:38:42.350 --> 05:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
ability of businesses to retain their
 
05:38:45.350 --> 05:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
workers uh versus the cost to uh you
 
05:38:48.390 --> 05:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
know to provide the subsidy um we also
 
05:38:50.990 --> 05:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
had a client in Mississippi do an early
 
05:38:53.910 --> 05:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
childhood education study uh drawing
 
05:38:56.708 --> 05:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
upon a wide literature trying to
 
05:38:57.990 --> 05:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
understand what were the long-term
 
05:39:00.350 --> 05:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
Workforce impacts versus what were the
 
05:39:02.670 --> 05:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
upfront costs and and how to balance
 
05:39:05.070 --> 05:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
those um and I'll just mention also
 
05:39:07.070 --> 05:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
there's been a variety you know I know
 
05:39:09.628 --> 05:39:09.638 align:start position:0%
that housing is an issue here and and
 
05:39:12.708 --> 05:39:12.718 align:start position:0%
everywhere in in in in the country um
 
05:39:14.708 --> 05:39:14.718 align:start position:0%
you know certainly a constraining factor
 
05:39:16.670 --> 05:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of cost potentially in terms of
 
05:39:18.910 --> 05:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce if you can't uh find places
 
05:39:21.070 --> 05:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
for workers who want to come and work to
 
05:39:24.350 --> 05:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
to to live uh you know we've done uh you
 
05:39:25.868 --> 05:39:25.878 align:start position:0%
know we and our clients have done a
 
05:39:28.868 --> 05:39:28.878 align:start position:0%
number of studies looking at um for
 
05:39:31.510 --> 05:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
example if we were to look at different
 
05:39:33.788 --> 05:39:33.798 align:start position:0%
uh zoning or development regimes what
 
05:39:36.670 --> 05:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
would be the impact in terms of uh you
 
05:39:39.030 --> 05:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
know additional uh you know kind of
 
05:39:41.590 --> 05:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
additional you know the kind of the the
 
05:39:43.830 --> 05:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
construction piece of it but also more
 
05:39:47.230 --> 05:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
widely uh the ability to bring down cost
 
05:39:50.310 --> 05:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
of you know the cost of living which is
 
05:39:52.350 --> 05:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know going to be you know not
 
05:39:54.190 --> 05:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
just beneficial for folks in the state
 
05:39:57.110 --> 05:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
but it also may be a driver of of in in
 
05:39:59.948 --> 05:39:59.958 align:start position:0%
migration into the state um can can I
 
05:40:02.548 --> 05:40:02.558 align:start position:0%
ask um yes inter interrupt a bit of
 
05:40:04.670 --> 05:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
course I I can see the kind of projects
 
05:40:06.510 --> 05:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
that you're working on and I understand
 
05:40:10.750 --> 05:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
the idea that um weighing the pros and
 
05:40:14.190 --> 05:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
cons and and and assigning values to
 
05:40:18.270 --> 05:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
them sure what um those clients that you
 
05:40:21.628 --> 05:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
mention do they hire you for that for
 
05:40:25.868 --> 05:40:25.878 align:start position:0%
those specific projects or do they um
 
05:40:25.878 --> 05:40:26.708 align:start position:0%
those specific projects or do they um
have

05:40:26.708 --> 05:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
inhouse um and and your brought in to
 
05:40:32.910 --> 05:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
just um confirm what they already
 
05:40:36.468 --> 05:40:36.478 align:start position:0%
thought um the the bill here is to try
 
05:40:40.190 --> 05:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
to create it seems to me a
 
05:40:43.628 --> 05:40:43.638 align:start position:0%
situation of having a permanent
 
05:40:46.948 --> 05:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
Department do these
 
05:40:49.788 --> 05:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
individual um
 
05:40:53.150 --> 05:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
analyses is it not true that there are
 
05:40:56.270 --> 05:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh groups like you that could be
 
05:41:00.110 --> 05:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
purchased for um for specific projects
 
05:41:03.910 --> 05:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
as they come up here so Mr chair so I
 
05:41:06.990 --> 05:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
would say most of our clients um do use
 
05:41:10.070 --> 05:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
the model themselves they have a team uh
 
05:41:13.190 --> 05:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
that takes many forms uh depending on uh
 
05:41:15.190 --> 05:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
the the the resources and Staffing that
 
05:41:17.350 --> 05:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
they have but generally most of our
 
05:41:20.390 --> 05:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
clients will operate at in-house uh and
 
05:41:22.830 --> 05:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
we are the software provider and we
 
05:41:27.070 --> 05:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
provide uh extensive support in terms of
 
05:41:29.430 --> 05:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
advisement But ultimately those clients
 
05:41:31.788 --> 05:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
are running the model themselves and
 
05:41:36.110 --> 05:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
doing the analysis themselves we are um
 
05:41:38.910 --> 05:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
as you know as part of my title I do run
 
05:41:41.310 --> 05:41:41.320 align:start position:0%
our Consulting practice it's a smaller
 
05:41:43.110 --> 05:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
part of our business but in certain
 
05:41:45.670 --> 05:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
cases um you know we are brought in as a
 
05:41:50.110 --> 05:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
third party um by either uh sometimes
 
05:41:51.990 --> 05:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
clients who have the model themselves
 
05:41:53.628 --> 05:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes clients who don't otherwise
 
05:41:55.468 --> 05:41:55.478 align:start position:0%
have a relationship with us to do a
 
05:41:58.708 --> 05:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
particular study so um there are
 
05:42:00.430 --> 05:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
instances of both but I would say the
 
05:42:04.788 --> 05:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
vast majority and certainly um the the
 
05:42:08.628 --> 05:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
the type of client that this um you know
 
05:42:10.948 --> 05:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
that that might be studied here we
 
05:42:12.868 --> 05:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
generally have the model in-house and be
 
05:42:15.230 --> 05:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
you know have a team running it with our
 
05:42:18.548 --> 05:42:18.558 align:start position:0%
support um from the outside would would
 
05:42:21.070 --> 05:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
that team inhouse be
 
05:42:23.190 --> 05:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
comparable um I'm not sure if you're
 
05:42:24.628 --> 05:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
familiar with our
 
05:42:27.868 --> 05:42:27.878 align:start position:0%
LBA organization our legislative budget
 
05:42:30.910 --> 05:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
would they be um I don't know if that is
 
05:42:32.868 --> 05:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
the kind of team that you're envisioning
 
05:42:35.030 --> 05:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
or is it something that we are not
 
05:42:38.190 --> 05:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
familiar with in in our current
 
05:42:41.830 --> 05:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
makeup uh to to the best of my
 
05:42:45.468 --> 05:42:45.478 align:start position:0%
understanding um I mean perhaps
 
05:42:46.868 --> 05:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
representative omy could speak a little
 
05:42:49.510 --> 05:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
bit more to this but I I would say I I
 
05:42:51.150 --> 05:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think it would be you know
 
05:42:52.830 --> 05:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
I think it would be a fairly
 
05:42:56.390 --> 05:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
standard um you know team you know that
 
05:42:59.070 --> 05:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
is uh you know often you know a non
 
05:43:01.788 --> 05:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
Artisan team that is just being you know
 
05:43:06.868 --> 05:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
being asked to consider bills um uh and
 
05:43:09.510 --> 05:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
kind of offering an evenhanded
 
05:43:13.150 --> 05:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
analysis is it um and I I don't mean to
 
05:43:15.190 --> 05:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
monopolize this if anybody else has
 
05:43:17.270 --> 05:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
questions here
 
05:43:22.190 --> 05:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
is is this um I guess my question would
 
05:43:22.200 --> 05:43:23.788 align:start position:0%
is is this um I guess my question would
be

05:43:23.788 --> 05:43:23.798 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:43:25.750 --> 05:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
um you've
 
05:43:29.070 --> 05:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
seen um various legislatures around the
 
05:43:29.080 --> 05:43:31.150 align:start position:0%
seen um various legislatures around the
the

05:43:31.150 --> 05:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:43:35.070 --> 05:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
country is it a process that re uh the
 
05:43:37.548 --> 05:43:37.558 align:start position:0%
types of bills that come up um and
 
05:43:39.310 --> 05:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
you've listed several that you've worked
 
05:43:41.788 --> 05:43:41.798 align:start position:0%
in different places
 
05:43:46.350 --> 05:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
um I guess it does justify an
 
05:43:50.390 --> 05:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
entire inhouse group rather than
 
05:43:52.788 --> 05:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
Contracting with someone using your
 
05:43:56.190 --> 05:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
model on specific projects is that right
 
05:43:59.110 --> 05:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
I I would say generally yes uh because
 
05:44:01.910 --> 05:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
is you know especially uh it offers more
 
05:44:03.990 --> 05:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility for example during a session
 
05:44:06.990 --> 05:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
if issues are coming up um and in
 
05:44:08.548 --> 05:44:08.558 align:start position:0%
certain cases you want to be able to
 
05:44:11.070 --> 05:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
turn around an analysis fairly quickly
 
05:44:12.990 --> 05:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
but also there may be a wide variety of
 
05:44:15.070 --> 05:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
issues over the course of a year that
 
05:44:16.510 --> 05:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
want to be that you would want to be
 
05:44:20.910 --> 05:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
looked at um and hiring uh a firm such
 
05:44:24.468 --> 05:44:24.478 align:start position:0%
as ourselves or comparable uh firm to
 
05:44:26.990 --> 05:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
look to work individually on each of
 
05:44:30.270 --> 05:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
those analyses uh you know you know may
 
05:44:33.868 --> 05:44:33.878 align:start position:0%
is likely to be less cost feasible um
 
05:44:35.750 --> 05:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
and and may offer a little bit less
 
05:44:39.190 --> 05:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
flexibility than having an in-house
 
05:44:39.200 --> 05:44:41.030 align:start position:0%
flexibility than having an in-house
team

05:44:41.030 --> 05:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
team
 
05:44:46.708 --> 05:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:51.390 --> 05:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:55.310 --> 05:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
around we are but humble
 
05:44:59.070 --> 05:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
men because I give me a little prefer
 
05:45:00.190 --> 05:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
here before the question because I've
 
05:45:02.230 --> 05:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
got to I've got to frame this so I can
 
05:45:03.230 --> 05:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
understand this
 
05:45:03.240 --> 05:45:05.030 align:start position:0%
understand this
right

05:45:05.030 --> 05:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:45:07.670 --> 05:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
with with having clients and what I'm
 
05:45:10.110 --> 05:45:10.120 align:start position:0%
seeing here with the testimony Utah
 
05:45:10.120 --> 05:45:11.548 align:start position:0%
seeing here with the testimony Utah
Massachusetts

05:45:11.548 --> 05:45:11.558 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
05:45:14.070 --> 05:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
Arkansas as
 
05:45:17.270 --> 05:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
examples Massachusetts has a state debt
 
05:45:20.750 --> 05:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
of$ 77 billion Arkansas's State debt has
 
05:45:23.830 --> 05:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
tripled since 2000 Utah's local debt is
 
05:45:23.840 --> 05:45:25.590 align:start position:0%
tripled since 2000 Utah's local debt is
$17

05:45:25.590 --> 05:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
$17
 
05:45:31.190 --> 05:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:33.990 --> 05:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
agencies not using what you're offering
 
05:45:36.230 --> 05:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
them correctly or is what you're
 
05:45:37.788 --> 05:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
offering them not
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
working because
 
05:45:42.270 --> 05:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
05:45:45.468 --> 05:45:45.478 align:start position:0%
seeing how if this is a model that is
 
05:45:45.478 --> 05:45:46.708 align:start position:0%
seeing how if this is a model that is
going

05:45:46.708 --> 05:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
going
 
05:45:52.868 --> 05:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:57.270 --> 05:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
economic holistic view right how the
 
05:45:58.590 --> 05:45:58.600 align:start position:0%
states that are using this are going
 
05:45:59.708 --> 05:45:59.718 align:start position:0%
deep deeper and deeper and deeper and
 
05:46:01.670 --> 05:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
deeper into debt that that's what I'm
 
05:46:03.788 --> 05:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out here so are they
 
05:46:05.468 --> 05:46:05.478 align:start position:0%
are they ignoring what you're doing is
 
05:46:07.830 --> 05:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
it they're not using it broadly enough I
 
05:46:11.788 --> 05:46:11.798 align:start position:0%
mean how how is this how is this
 
05:46:13.628 --> 05:46:13.638 align:start position:0%
relationship functioning with what
 
05:46:17.468 --> 05:46:17.478 align:start position:0%
you're you're doing to actually being
 
05:46:19.590 --> 05:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
successful because in those three states
 
05:46:21.548 --> 05:46:21.558 align:start position:0%
they're going the wrong
 
05:46:25.110 --> 05:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
way sure thank you so I I would I would
 
05:46:28.390 --> 05:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh couple of responses one one is you
 
05:46:31.628 --> 05:46:31.638 align:start position:0%
know we work with clients in in the vast
 
05:46:33.750 --> 05:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
majority of States so those are three
 
05:46:35.590 --> 05:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
but we work with with clients across the
 
05:46:38.910 --> 05:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
board um I I would say also you know
 
05:46:41.150 --> 05:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
modeling is you know we also have to be
 
05:46:45.030 --> 05:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
humble as as modelers uh we you know we
 
05:46:47.070 --> 05:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
cannot predict the future we're just
 
05:46:50.230 --> 05:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
doing our best to understand uh what is
 
05:46:51.910 --> 05:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know what are the most probable
 
05:46:54.868 --> 05:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
outcomes um so that is not to say that
 
05:46:58.190 --> 05:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
every analysis that's done by any model
 
05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
is going to be totally accurate there
 
05:47:01.708 --> 05:47:01.718 align:start position:0%
may be
 
05:47:04.830 --> 05:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
deficiencies um but we are you know in
 
05:47:08.548 --> 05:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
terms of what we offer um you know the
 
05:47:11.590 --> 05:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know the model is uh as
 
05:47:13.548 --> 05:47:13.558 align:start position:0%
representative Aly mentioned it's been
 
05:47:17.230 --> 05:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
developed over many years based on in a
 
05:47:19.788 --> 05:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed uh kind of AC academic
 
05:47:22.310 --> 05:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
literature um it's been it's been looked
 
05:47:25.548 --> 05:47:25.558 align:start position:0%
at no model is perfect uh you know we we
 
05:47:29.708 --> 05:47:29.718 align:start position:0%
we stand behind it um I think you know
 
05:47:32.270 --> 05:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
also I'll say you know you know we're
 
05:47:34.030 --> 05:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
asked to look you know the the model is
 
05:47:36.468 --> 05:47:36.478 align:start position:0%
being asked whether it's us or the teams
 
05:47:38.910 --> 05:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
at the various clients um you know
 
05:47:40.590 --> 05:47:40.600 align:start position:0%
they're they're looking at particular
 
05:47:43.910 --> 05:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
issues um it it may be worth looking at
 
05:47:47.110 --> 05:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
kind of wider issues as well um because
 
05:47:49.190 --> 05:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
certainly um you know the issues you
 
05:47:53.310 --> 05:47:53.320 align:start position:0%
point to are of concern um
 
05:47:56.948 --> 05:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
maybe uh you know but the purviews maybe
 
05:48:00.830 --> 05:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
haven't allowed them to to look at those
 
05:48:04.070 --> 05:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
issues sure um not along the same lines
 
05:48:08.628 --> 05:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
though I mean as far as I can see it's
 
05:48:10.628 --> 05:48:10.638 align:start position:0%
the relative debt of the individual
 
05:48:11.990 --> 05:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
company uh
 
05:48:16.110 --> 05:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
country states thank you
 
05:48:19.270 --> 05:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
um may have completely nothing to do
 
05:48:21.070 --> 05:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
with with their work that's where I was
 
05:48:24.708 --> 05:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
going with my next question so so it's
 
05:48:28.708 --> 05:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
not entirely fair to the accusatory tone
 
05:48:31.430 --> 05:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
um we all we're trying to do is find out
 
05:48:34.990 --> 05:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
whether this is something that um we
 
05:48:37.390 --> 05:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
should take to the next level and study
 
05:48:40.788 --> 05:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
here that's all we're trying to do so my
 
05:48:43.948 --> 05:48:43.958 align:start position:0%
other question that that you didn't
 
05:48:45.868 --> 05:48:45.878 align:start position:0%
answer was are you finding that when you
 
05:48:49.150 --> 05:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
are providing your services that these
 
05:48:50.670 --> 05:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
government because ultimately you don't
 
05:48:52.670 --> 05:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
make the decisions right the legislators
 
05:48:54.708 --> 05:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
those bodies make decision you're a tool
 
05:48:57.350 --> 05:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's used in part of that process are
 
05:48:59.190 --> 05:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
you finding that there
 
05:49:02.548 --> 05:49:02.558 align:start position:0%
ignoring or or not doing what you're
 
05:49:05.350 --> 05:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
offering properly is that is that a
 
05:49:07.270 --> 05:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
common problem for you guys or is this
 
05:49:08.670 --> 05:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
something where when you come in and you
 
05:49:09.788 --> 05:49:09.798 align:start position:0%
do what
 
05:49:12.430 --> 05:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
you're projected to do that that's
 
05:49:15.910 --> 05:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
embraced by the clients or the states
 
05:49:17.708 --> 05:49:17.718 align:start position:0%
that bring you into to do that do what
 
05:49:21.510 --> 05:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
you do you see what I'm getting at yes
 
05:49:25.590 --> 05:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
um I I would say we offer our clients
 
05:49:28.830 --> 05:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
our counsil on best practices and we we
 
05:49:31.548 --> 05:49:31.558 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're trained and aware
 
05:49:34.670 --> 05:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
um when when we are brought in to work
 
05:49:37.468 --> 05:49:37.478 align:start position:0%
on a particular project we will always
 
05:49:41.030 --> 05:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
follow those best practices um but
 
05:49:43.230 --> 05:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately as you said we are a tool I
 
05:49:45.628 --> 05:49:45.638 align:start position:0%
cannot speak to whether our clients are
 
05:49:47.910 --> 05:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
following or not following our our our
 
05:49:50.230 --> 05:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
guidance uh I would be speaking out of
 
05:49:53.310 --> 05:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
turn I don't really know um to the best
 
05:49:54.910 --> 05:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
to the best of our knowledge we feel
 
05:49:56.628 --> 05:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
that we offer good advice and that our
 
05:49:58.670 --> 05:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
clients are receptive but that may not
 
05:50:00.670 --> 05:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
always happen but it it's hard to know I
 
05:50:01.868 --> 05:50:01.878 align:start position:0%
can't speak to
 
05:50:05.310 --> 05:50:05.320 align:start position:0%
that if I may each state operates a bit
 
05:50:07.948 --> 05:50:07.958 align:start position:0%
differently so sometimes when they're
 
05:50:10.990 --> 05:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
asked to do a dynamic fiscal note some
 
05:50:13.590 --> 05:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
states will say it needs to have a
 
05:50:16.150 --> 05:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
static fiscal impact one way or the
 
05:50:18.990 --> 05:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
other positive or negative of 10 million
 
05:50:20.948 --> 05:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
some states may say 50 million 100
 
05:50:22.750 --> 05:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
million so they're not necessarily
 
05:50:26.150 --> 05:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
running the analysis on every single
 
05:50:27.948 --> 05:50:27.958 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation it needs to be
 
05:50:30.548 --> 05:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
typically a significant enough uh piece
 
05:50:33.270 --> 05:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
of legislation or or sometimes through
 
05:50:35.070 --> 05:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
uh audit committees associated with a
 
05:50:36.788 --> 05:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
legislature they may go back on like a
 
05:50:39.670 --> 05:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
biannual basis in review recent
 
05:50:41.868 --> 05:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
incentive programs and and so yes it is
 
05:50:45.990 --> 05:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
a tool to to inform policy makers um but
 
05:50:48.948 --> 05:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
not every piece of legislation uh you
 
05:50:51.948 --> 05:50:51.958 align:start position:0%
know current nor past may may be
 
05:50:56.190 --> 05:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
evaluated thank you hey uh represent
 
05:50:59.110 --> 05:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
um representative walls uh you have a
 
05:51:00.868 --> 05:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much thank you
 
05:51:02.430 --> 05:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
for being here and thank you for your
 
05:51:05.788 --> 05:51:05.798 align:start position:0%
testimonies uh just a quick question we
 
05:51:08.628 --> 05:51:08.638 align:start position:0%
heard previously that it helps to take a
 
05:51:12.628 --> 05:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
second look at what our LBA is doing are
 
05:51:14.910 --> 05:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
you looking to complement the work they
 
05:51:18.468 --> 05:51:18.478 align:start position:0%
do add to what they're doing or what how
 
05:51:20.628 --> 05:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
would you how would this go along with
 
05:51:22.830 --> 05:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
what we're already
 
05:51:26.548 --> 05:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
doing yeah I I I would say um I would be
 
05:51:28.030 --> 05:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
more comfortable deferring that to
 
05:51:30.350 --> 05:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
repres of all me just I I don't want to
 
05:51:31.868 --> 05:51:31.878 align:start position:0%
speak on her behalf in terms of the
 
05:51:33.990 --> 05:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
vision but what I can say is that you
 
05:51:36.150 --> 05:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
know um a a tool like ours would be
 
05:51:38.990 --> 05:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
useful for whatever work is being done
 
05:51:41.948 --> 05:51:41.958 align:start position:0%
in this realm um but uh I wouldn't want
 
05:51:44.510 --> 05:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
to step on any toes
 
05:51:48.190 --> 05:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh very nicely said um representative
 
05:51:51.110 --> 05:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
nutting Wong um so after listening to
 
05:51:52.670 --> 05:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
Pearson I was trying uh representative
 
05:51:54.590 --> 05:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
Pearson I was um
 
05:51:57.830 --> 05:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
thinking um what I would what's like
 
05:52:00.150 --> 05:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
kind of confusing me right now I guess I
 
05:52:01.150 --> 05:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
don't really know where I'm going with
 
05:52:01.160 --> 05:52:03.430 align:start position:0%
don't really know where I'm going with
this

05:52:03.430 --> 05:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:52:07.390 --> 05:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
um I would love to have like a model of
 
05:52:10.590 --> 05:52:10.600 align:start position:0%
like what we do now and what would
 
05:52:13.310 --> 05:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
happen if we chose your model is that
 
05:52:15.830 --> 05:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
kind of what you do right now or that's
 
05:52:17.390 --> 05:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
what you're
 
05:52:22.948 --> 05:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
offering if it was money um I just so I
 
05:52:24.750 --> 05:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
understand I think what what we're
 
05:52:28.910 --> 05:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
talking about is rather than our static
 
05:52:31.708 --> 05:52:31.718 align:start position:0%
view of where we the snapshot of where
 
05:52:36.230 --> 05:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
we are now for for big items um when
 
05:52:37.868 --> 05:52:37.878 align:start position:0%
we're talking about them through Ways
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
and Means and
 
05:52:43.030 --> 05:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
finance this is a more longer
 
05:52:46.628 --> 05:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
term um model I hate to use the word
 
05:52:50.350 --> 05:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
model but this is um evaluating it over
 
05:52:52.548 --> 05:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
a longer period of time rather than the
 
05:52:54.628 --> 05:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
snapshot okay I was thinking different
 
05:52:58.750 --> 05:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
VAR and so it's it while it might be I
 
05:53:01.788 --> 05:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
think through our um and I
 
05:53:03.590 --> 05:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative Aly would probably be
 
05:53:05.788 --> 05:53:05.798 align:start position:0%
much better to answer this but while
 
05:53:10.628 --> 05:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
it's maybe connected to what LBA does on
 
05:53:13.510 --> 05:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
a static basis with our fiscal
 
05:53:16.510 --> 05:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
notes this would be much more
 
05:53:16.520 --> 05:53:18.190 align:start position:0%
notes this would be much more
extensive

05:53:18.190 --> 05:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
extensive
 
05:53:22.070 --> 05:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
um if if it was that we had this service
 
05:53:26.868 --> 05:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
in house um I'm not where I'm headed is
 
05:53:30.270 --> 05:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
whether there is an a middle ground that
 
05:53:31.868 --> 05:53:31.878 align:start position:0%
isn't a
 
05:53:35.110 --> 05:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
full-time operation that does
 
05:53:35.120 --> 05:53:37.390 align:start position:0%
full-time operation that does
longitudinal

05:53:37.390 --> 05:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
longitudinal
 
05:53:41.548 --> 05:53:41.558 align:start position:0%
studies but also not static if there are
 
05:53:43.708 --> 05:53:43.718 align:start position:0%
projects that we would have that would
 
05:53:47.548 --> 05:53:47.558 align:start position:0%
be able to be used and hire you know
 
05:53:50.468 --> 05:53:50.478 align:start position:0%
subcontract someone out to study this
 
05:53:53.708 --> 05:53:53.718 align:start position:0%
particular bill this particular
 
05:53:58.990 --> 05:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
thing than have a um an in-house
 
05:54:03.670 --> 05:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
247 service to use and maybe that's what
 
05:54:07.030 --> 05:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative Aly is intending to be
 
05:54:09.270 --> 05:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
one of the topics of conversation from
 
05:54:11.628 --> 05:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
this study commission I think that's how
 
05:54:15.390 --> 05:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
I'm wrapping my my head around this
 
05:54:15.400 --> 05:54:17.310 align:start position:0%
I'm wrapping my my head around this
further

05:54:17.310 --> 05:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:54:17.320 --> 05:54:19.350 align:start position:0%
further
questions

05:54:19.350 --> 05:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:54:23.190 --> 05:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
um I do you have any comment I guess on
 
05:54:26.910 --> 05:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
what I just is that seem fair uh yes it
 
05:54:28.548 --> 05:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
it does seem fair are there there other
 
05:54:32.270 --> 05:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
firms like yours that um have or how
 
05:54:34.750 --> 05:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
many other firms are there that have
 
05:54:38.708 --> 05:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
their own model that would be
 
05:54:42.548 --> 05:54:42.558 align:start position:0%
um utilized by the that could be sitting
 
05:54:46.270 --> 05:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
here if rep Aly had contacted them how
 
05:54:49.628 --> 05:54:49.638 align:start position:0%
many how many what's the world like for
 
05:54:52.590 --> 05:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
you as competition
 
05:54:57.350 --> 05:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
so I I would say um and I I welcome you
 
05:54:59.070 --> 05:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
know I welcome you know kind of that to
 
05:55:01.548 --> 05:55:01.558 align:start position:0%
be a topic of inquiry I would say in in
 
05:55:03.868 --> 05:55:03.878 align:start position:0%
our specific area it's it's quite
 
05:55:05.628 --> 05:55:05.638 align:start position:0%
limited there are other firms that do
 
05:55:08.590 --> 05:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
economic and fiscal impact analysis uh
 
05:55:11.310 --> 05:55:11.320 align:start position:0%
there are a number of them that are also
 
05:55:13.948 --> 05:55:13.958 align:start position:0%
kind of of the static variety um you
 
05:55:15.190 --> 05:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
know where you're getting more of a
 
05:55:19.548 --> 05:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
snapshot uh I'm not aware of um kind of
 
05:55:22.310 --> 05:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
a perfect substitute for what we offer
 
05:55:26.150 --> 05:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of dynamic fiscal analysis uh
 
05:55:28.590 --> 05:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
but there there are other firms who work
 
05:55:33.948 --> 05:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
in this space generally okay thank you
 
05:55:36.868 --> 05:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
anyone um I I think I interrupted your
 
05:55:40.150 --> 05:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
your um Talk are there other items you'd
 
05:55:42.350 --> 05:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
like us to be aware of
 
05:55:45.708 --> 05:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
before uh uh I think I was just about to
 
05:55:49.350 --> 05:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
wrap up anyway I'll just say um in terms
 
05:55:51.510 --> 05:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
of kind of the you know in-house versus
 
05:55:54.430 --> 05:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
bringing in you know hiring I would say
 
05:55:57.430 --> 05:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
both are both um obviously both are done
 
05:55:59.070 --> 05:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
we see both done I think it's just a
 
05:56:02.190 --> 05:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
matter of what you feel the frequency is
 
05:56:04.350 --> 05:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
uh of needing that kind of analysis if
 
05:56:06.270 --> 05:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
you if it needs to be fairly on a
 
05:56:07.990 --> 05:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
regular basis then I would say having an
 
05:56:10.310 --> 05:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
in-house team is preferable if it's
 
05:56:12.468 --> 05:56:12.478 align:start position:0%
every once in a while then you know
 
05:56:14.990 --> 05:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
bringing in a firm such as Remy or or a
 
05:56:17.948 --> 05:56:17.958 align:start position:0%
comparable firm uh would I think be just
 
05:56:19.350 --> 05:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
fine as well I think that would work
 
05:56:22.548 --> 05:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
well so uh but it does I think your it
 
05:56:24.030 --> 05:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
sounds like your understanding is is
 
05:56:26.270 --> 05:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
good of the next steps here and I would
 
05:56:28.030 --> 05:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
imagine that would be a discussion for
 
05:56:32.070 --> 05:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you any other other
 
05:56:33.788 --> 05:56:33.798 align:start position:0%
points no from the other side of the
 
05:56:37.230 --> 05:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
table no thank you I think your
 
05:56:39.708 --> 05:56:39.718 align:start position:0%
understanding uh is is sound and
 
05:56:42.030 --> 05:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with what we have in mind
 
05:56:43.628 --> 05:56:43.638 align:start position:0%
great well thank you very much for
 
05:56:45.390 --> 05:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
coming I appreciate it very much and I'm
 
05:56:47.350 --> 05:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
sorry for the weight no problem thank
 
05:56:50.070 --> 05:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
you very much um do you have a
 
05:56:54.830 --> 05:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:00.390 --> 05:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:01.990 --> 05:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you gentlemen thank you very much

05:57:11.190 --> 05:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:15.948 --> 05:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
um okay um could you please in introduce
 
05:57:18.110 --> 05:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
yourself and welcome to legis yes Mr
 
05:57:21.670 --> 05:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you and um uh yes I'll
 
05:57:24.190 --> 05:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
introduce myself because I'm here to
 
05:57:27.788 --> 05:57:27.798 align:start position:0%
strongly support this bill the way it's
 
05:57:30.070 --> 05:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
written to set up a
 
05:57:34.390 --> 05:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
commission um I was a member of this
 
05:57:38.468 --> 05:57:38.478 align:start position:0%
house in the late ' 80s and uh early 90s
 
05:57:41.390 --> 05:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
I served four terms three terms on the
 
05:57:44.110 --> 05:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
house finance committee when I decided
 
05:57:47.030 --> 05:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
not to run again U the committee at my
 
05:57:50.788 --> 05:57:50.798 align:start position:0%
retirement party gave me literally a
 
05:57:52.910 --> 05:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
100-year old crystal ball that had been
 
05:57:56.030 --> 05:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
used in many seances because what I had
 
05:57:59.190 --> 05:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
been doing in that committee was trying
 
05:58:02.430 --> 05:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
to focus on the future and what the heck
 
05:58:04.468 --> 05:58:04.478 align:start position:0%
is this decision we're going to make in
 
05:58:07.150 --> 05:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
finance here going to mean four years
 
05:58:09.670 --> 05:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
down the line six years down the line
 
05:58:11.030 --> 05:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to look into the future and
 
05:58:13.590 --> 05:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to describe who you are and
 
05:58:15.750 --> 05:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
and why you're here who you are right
 
05:58:18.230 --> 05:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
now would be good yes Douglas Hall I
 
05:58:20.110 --> 05:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
live in Chai Chester I'm just here
 
05:58:22.948 --> 05:58:22.958 align:start position:0%
representing myself because of my prior
 
05:58:25.510 --> 05:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
experience part of which I
 
05:58:27.708 --> 05:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
described also when I left the
 
05:58:30.948 --> 05:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
legislature the uh speaker and the
 
05:58:34.270 --> 05:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
Senate President offered me the job as
 
05:58:37.270 --> 05:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget assistant and I
 
05:58:41.708 --> 05:58:41.718 align:start position:0%
turned that down and at some point with
 
05:58:43.868 --> 05:58:43.878 align:start position:0%
if this commission is set up I'd like to
 
05:58:46.030 --> 05:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
talk to them about why I turned that
 
05:58:48.548 --> 05:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
down because there are certain positives
 
05:58:51.030 --> 05:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
and certain negatives about having any
 
05:58:53.868 --> 05:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
kind of future forecasting being done in
 
05:59:00.190 --> 05:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:00.200 --> 05:59:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
unfortunately

05:59:01.750 --> 05:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
05:59:04.830 --> 05:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
the the way New Hampshire does long-term
 
05:59:07.750 --> 05:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
planning is with a two-year time
 
05:59:10.468 --> 05:59:10.478 align:start position:0%
Horizon that's long term sometimes it's
 
05:59:12.788 --> 05:59:12.798 align:start position:0%
even shorter than that and that's
 
05:59:16.190 --> 05:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
because of the election cycle for every
 
05:59:18.350 --> 05:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
state elected
 
05:59:22.350 --> 05:59:22.360 align:start position:0%
official and in reality we should be
 
05:59:25.788 --> 05:59:25.798 align:start position:0%
planning much longer ahead than that and
 
05:59:28.390 --> 05:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
know what different policy Alternatives
 
05:59:28.400 --> 05:59:29.390 align:start position:0%
know what different policy Alternatives
might

05:59:29.390 --> 05:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
might
 
05:59:31.990 --> 05:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
mean Walter Peterson when he was
 
05:59:34.390 --> 05:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
governor set up a process to do a
 
05:59:38.070 --> 05:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
10-year plan it didn't last after his
 
05:59:42.990 --> 05:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
term uh when I was in the house uh
 
05:59:45.750 --> 05:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
legislation passed that required a state
 
05:59:51.150 --> 05:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
development plan economic plan and um
 
05:59:52.910 --> 05:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
that plan was done in
 
05:59:55.430 --> 05:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
1988 1990
 
05:59:59.910 --> 05:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
1992 94 96 6 1998 and
 
06:00:02.430 --> 06:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
2000 RSA
 
06:00:05.310 --> 06:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
9A requires this
 
06:00:09.350 --> 06:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
plan it has not been done since the year
 
06:00:13.230 --> 06:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
2000 um I contacted the people in um the
 
06:00:15.150 --> 06:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
department who were responsible for it
 
06:00:17.510 --> 06:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
they said there were efforts in
 
06:00:20.390 --> 06:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
2003 2007 and
 
06:00:23.270 --> 06:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
2011 which didn't proceed due to the
 
06:00:25.310 --> 06:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
lack of funding and buy in from the
 
06:00:28.548 --> 06:00:28.558 align:start position:0%
governor's office at the time
 
06:00:30.270 --> 06:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
this is where we are with any kind of
 
06:00:34.030 --> 06:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
planning in New Hampshire and if this
 
06:00:35.788 --> 06:00:35.798 align:start position:0%
commission is set up and all you're
 
06:00:37.670 --> 06:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
being asked to do is set up the
 
06:00:39.948 --> 06:00:39.958 align:start position:0%
commission so that then some real
 
06:00:43.868 --> 06:00:43.878 align:start position:0%
discussion Could Happen about what where
 
06:00:45.990 --> 06:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
should this commission be what should be
 
06:00:46.000 --> 06:00:46.910 align:start position:0%
should this commission be what should be
its

06:00:46.910 --> 06:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
its
 
06:00:49.628 --> 06:00:49.638 align:start position:0%
charge I would love to talk to that
 
06:00:52.510 --> 06:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
commission about some the things that I
 
06:00:55.350 --> 06:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
know that would be helpful to them in
 
06:00:57.510 --> 06:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
coming up with legislation for a
 
06:01:02.510 --> 06:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
subsequent time to deal with this um and
 
06:01:06.430 --> 06:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
so that's essentially all I want to say
 
06:01:09.230 --> 06:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
I I think it's really important to set
 
06:01:11.948 --> 06:01:11.958 align:start position:0%
up this commission and if you do do that
 
06:01:14.070 --> 06:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
if it passes through your committee
 
06:01:16.750 --> 06:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
through the house into the Senate uh and
 
06:01:19.548 --> 06:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
becomes law I will be there to talk to
 
06:01:22.830 --> 06:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
the commission thank you thank you uh
 
06:01:25.708 --> 06:01:25.718 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions yes
 
06:01:28.070 --> 06:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
yes any questions from the committee
 
06:01:30.430 --> 06:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
representative sers yeah thank you Mr
 
06:01:32.270 --> 06:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to say you perfectly
 
06:01:34.830 --> 06:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
put because uh I think the commission
 
06:01:37.830 --> 06:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
will find out is it something we we need
 
06:01:39.548 --> 06:01:39.558 align:start position:0%
is it something internal is it something
 
06:01:42.708 --> 06:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
external that we can use so I I think
 
06:01:45.190 --> 06:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
this is you got to do the commission or
 
06:01:47.868 --> 06:01:47.878 align:start position:0%
the study to find this out it sounds
 
06:01:50.430 --> 06:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
like it would you believe I I would I
 
06:01:53.110 --> 06:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
would believe that uh and I would
 
06:01:56.708 --> 06:01:56.718 align:start position:0%
mention that um that there's the fiscal
 
06:01:58.310 --> 06:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
policy in
 
06:02:01.150 --> 06:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
and you'll hear from them uh there's the
 
06:02:03.750 --> 06:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
Cary school at UNH that does good
 
06:02:07.430 --> 06:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
demographic work um I'm not here to
 
06:02:10.868 --> 06:02:10.878 align:start position:0%
support any particular contractor or any
 
06:02:12.830 --> 06:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
particular way of doing it I'm just here
 
06:02:15.150 --> 06:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
to support the idea we need the
 
06:02:17.868 --> 06:02:17.878 align:start position:0%
commission in order to try to do
 
06:02:19.948 --> 06:02:19.958 align:start position:0%
something about long range planning in
 
06:02:19.958 --> 06:02:21.070 align:start position:0%
something about long range planning in
this

06:02:21.070 --> 06:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:02:25.030 --> 06:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
state Mr Hall can can I ask uh your
 
06:02:28.990 --> 06:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
opinion then on the makeup of of the
 
06:02:31.788 --> 06:02:31.798 align:start position:0%
commission um i' I'd leave that to
 
06:02:35.350 --> 06:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative Aly um you know if if
 
06:02:37.310 --> 06:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to be in the
 
06:02:40.548 --> 06:02:40.558 align:start position:0%
legislature in the end and the the you
 
06:02:42.750 --> 06:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
do need to have legislators as part of
 
06:02:44.868 --> 06:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
that commission but there are other
 
06:02:46.948 --> 06:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
possibilities and I think there's some
 
06:02:48.468 --> 06:02:48.478 align:start position:0%
arrangement for that within the
 
06:02:51.708 --> 06:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
membership that's been specified but I
 
06:02:53.430 --> 06:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
would leave that up to representative
 
06:02:56.670 --> 06:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
Aly as the sponsor to suggest any
 
06:02:59.110 --> 06:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
changes to what's already in there I'm
 
06:03:02.150 --> 06:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
fine with it however the membership
 
06:03:06.350 --> 06:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
is um okay how about uh the duration are
 
06:03:11.070 --> 06:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
you are you okay with the idea that um
 
06:03:12.990 --> 06:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
they would be able to issue their final
 
06:03:16.110 --> 06:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
report by November 15 of
 
06:03:19.830 --> 06:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
2024 yes it shouldn't take very long if
 
06:03:23.150 --> 06:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
they now I would have to say if they
 
06:03:25.110 --> 06:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
meet once a month and it doesn't get
 
06:03:28.628 --> 06:03:28.638 align:start position:0%
passed until June well maybe not but if
 
06:03:31.708 --> 06:03:31.718 align:start position:0%
you set the deadline in in November
 
06:03:34.150 --> 06:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
that's fine then maybe they have to meet
 
06:03:36.070 --> 06:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
every two weeks in order to get the work
 
06:03:39.190 --> 06:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
done so I'm fine with the deadline but
 
06:03:41.670 --> 06:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
if they don't actually get together very
 
06:03:44.948 --> 06:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
much um they're not going to make the
 
06:03:52.190 --> 06:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:54.788 --> 06:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
help last but not
 
06:03:59.990 --> 06:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
least um I got the philli part um if you
 
06:04:03.270 --> 06:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
could if if you could introduce yourself
 
06:04:10.510 --> 06:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:25.110 --> 06:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:29.430 --> 06:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:37.750 --> 06:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:39.948 --> 06:04:39.958 align:start position:0%
alone welcome to legislative
 
06:04:41.868 --> 06:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you very much I
 
06:04:43.590 --> 06:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the opportunity to
 
06:04:45.590 --> 06:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
speak before you um Mr chairman members
 
06:04:47.468 --> 06:04:47.478 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Phil slon
 
06:04:48.788 --> 06:04:48.798 align:start position:0%
I'm the research director at the New
 
06:04:51.788 --> 06:04:51.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fiscal policy Institute NH fpi
 
06:04:54.270 --> 06:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
is a nonprofit nonpartisan independent
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
policy research organization based right
 
06:04:58.030 --> 06:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
here in conquer we examine the state
 
06:05:00.350 --> 06:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
budget state revenue the state economy
 
06:05:02.310 --> 06:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
and the economic security of granite
 
06:05:04.590 --> 06:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
Staters um we don't have any positions
 
06:05:06.670 --> 06:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
on pending legislation so we don't we
 
06:05:08.628 --> 06:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
don't Lobby I'm not here to provide
 
06:05:09.830 --> 06:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
anything more than informational
 
06:05:12.030 --> 06:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
testimony what I wanted to provide you
 
06:05:13.830 --> 06:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
with today is a very high level summary
 
06:05:16.070 --> 06:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
of the publicly available research on
 
06:05:17.910 --> 06:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
state revenue estimates and estimating
 
06:05:20.910 --> 06:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
methodologies that other states use um a
 
06:05:23.150 --> 06:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
lot of the in-depth research a lot of
 
06:05:25.590 --> 06:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
the uh um academic research in
 
06:05:29.190 --> 06:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
literature around the revenue estimating
 
06:05:31.390 --> 06:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
methods of States actually was conducted
 
06:05:33.070 --> 06:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
in the wake of the Great Recession of
 
06:05:35.190 --> 06:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
2007 to 2009 when a lot of States had
 
06:05:37.830 --> 06:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
trouble estimating revenues through that
 
06:05:39.230 --> 06:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
time period and New Hampshire was one of
 
06:05:41.910 --> 06:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
them um because it's a difficult Dynamic
 
06:05:43.430 --> 06:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
economic environment and that's common
 
06:05:44.670 --> 06:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
that it's difficult for states to
 
06:05:46.788 --> 06:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
estimate Revenue in those so a lot of
 
06:05:49.030 --> 06:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
the existing research focuses on that
 
06:05:51.910 --> 06:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
time period and on processes um
 
06:05:54.150 --> 06:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
associated with Revenue estimation
 
06:05:55.948 --> 06:05:55.958 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimating processes do vary
 
06:05:58.230 --> 06:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
considerably by state forecast might be
 
06:06:00.030 --> 06:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
produced by the Executive Branch the
 
06:06:02.270 --> 06:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
legislative branch a combination of both
 
06:06:04.468 --> 06:06:04.478 align:start position:0%
or groups of academics or economic
 
06:06:06.468 --> 06:06:06.478 align:start position:0%
Consultants may be called in to uh
 
06:06:08.990 --> 06:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
produce Revenue estimates some more
 
06:06:10.510 --> 06:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
recent data that we have which is
 
06:06:11.750 --> 06:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
actually from the National Association
 
06:06:13.548 --> 06:06:13.558 align:start position:0%
of state budget officers they surveyed
 
06:06:14.670 --> 06:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
States in
 
06:06:18.070 --> 06:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
2021 28 States used what was called a
 
06:06:20.468 --> 06:06:20.478 align:start position:0%
consensus forecasting method which is
 
06:06:21.910 --> 06:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
creating binding estimates that are
 
06:06:23.548 --> 06:06:23.558 align:start position:0%
produced by a group of legislative and
 
06:06:25.230 --> 06:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
executive branch officials sometimes
 
06:06:28.070 --> 06:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
including outside um economists and
 
06:06:30.628 --> 06:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
other experts as well uh that was 28
 
06:06:32.468 --> 06:06:32.478 align:start position:0%
States 12 States including New Hampshire
 
06:06:33.990 --> 06:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
had competing forecasts from the
 
06:06:35.910 --> 06:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
executive and legislative branches and
 
06:06:38.030 --> 06:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
then 10 states gave sole responsibility
 
06:06:40.990 --> 06:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
for forecasting Revenue to the executive
 
06:06:44.270 --> 06:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
branch and uh in that same survey 18
 
06:06:46.510 --> 06:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
states reported having a council of
 
06:06:49.788 --> 06:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
economic advisers of some form so uh and
 
06:06:50.990 --> 06:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was not one of those
 
06:06:53.590 --> 06:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
states there were 40 States including
 
06:06:56.070 --> 06:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where the executive branch
 
06:06:58.468 --> 06:06:58.478 align:start position:0%
budget office provided Revenue estimates
 
06:06:59.910 --> 06:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the correlator to this
 
06:07:01.430 --> 06:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
would be the budget Office of the
 
06:07:03.750 --> 06:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services uh
 
06:07:05.788 --> 06:07:05.798 align:start position:0%
and the revenue estimates that come from
 
06:07:07.310 --> 06:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
06:07:08.548 --> 06:07:08.558 align:start position:0%
that the house Ways and Means Committee
 
06:07:09.670 --> 06:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
and Senate Ways and Means committees
 
06:07:12.548 --> 06:07:12.558 align:start position:0%
look at as well as the other um agencies
 
06:07:13.990 --> 06:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
that collect revenues whether that's the
 
06:07:15.310 --> 06:07:15.320 align:start position:0%
insurance department the Lottery
 
06:07:19.030 --> 06:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
Commission Etc 37 States not including
 
06:07:22.390 --> 06:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um had the budget office
 
06:07:24.670 --> 06:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
play a role in economic analysis so
 
06:07:26.230 --> 06:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
performing some form of economic
 
06:07:29.430 --> 06:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
forecasting that was in 37 States 19
 
06:07:31.270 --> 06:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
States also not including New Hampshire
 
06:07:33.110 --> 06:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
had a budget office that assisted with
 
06:07:33.120 --> 06:07:34.350 align:start position:0%
had a budget office that assisted with
demographic

06:07:34.350 --> 06:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
demographic
 
06:07:38.110 --> 06:07:38.120 align:start position:0%
analysis and older survey data from 2008
 
06:07:39.468 --> 06:07:39.478 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately this is quite a bit
 
06:07:41.030 --> 06:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
older but does provide a little bit more
 
06:07:44.430 --> 06:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
depth um does give us some insights into
 
06:07:46.190 --> 06:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
the technical methodologies that those
 
06:07:49.110 --> 06:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
States used so 27 states of 40 that
 
06:07:50.628 --> 06:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
responded to this question reported
 
06:07:52.628 --> 06:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
using a simple trendline analysis for
 
06:07:54.510 --> 06:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue forecasting that included New
 
06:07:57.430 --> 06:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 2008 27 States not
 
06:07:59.510 --> 06:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire used time series
 
06:08:01.910 --> 06:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
modeling 32 states used linear
 
06:08:04.868 --> 06:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
regression modeling 16 States used a
 
06:08:07.230 --> 06:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
simulation and 14 used a private
 
06:08:08.750 --> 06:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
consultant and New Hampshire was only
 
06:08:10.590 --> 06:08:10.600 align:start position:0%
included in the 27 states that used the
 
06:08:13.788 --> 06:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
simple trend line analysis a 2011
 
06:08:15.548 --> 06:08:15.558 align:start position:0%
literate r view indicated that at the
 
06:08:17.910 --> 06:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
time there was not a single method of
 
06:08:19.750 --> 06:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
estimating Revenue that was considered
 
06:08:22.150 --> 06:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
Superior from the others uh so the
 
06:08:23.788 --> 06:08:23.798 align:start position:0%
method the the research was a little
 
06:08:25.670 --> 06:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
agnostic on the method at least at that
 
06:08:27.910 --> 06:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
time but the research also suggested
 
06:08:29.670 --> 06:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
that well consensus Revenue estimating
 
06:08:31.750 --> 06:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
methods were not necessarily better
 
06:08:33.708 --> 06:08:33.718 align:start position:0%
combining Revenue estimates were so
 
06:08:35.110 --> 06:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
producing multiple sets of Revenue
 
06:08:36.868 --> 06:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
estimates and having many different
 
06:08:38.708 --> 06:08:38.718 align:start position:0%
viewpoints that then led to a combined
 
06:08:41.270 --> 06:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
set of Revenue estimates that was a u
 
06:08:44.190 --> 06:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
that was a valuable method so on the
 
06:08:46.468 --> 06:08:46.478 align:start position:0%
third page of the packet that I just
 
06:08:48.590 --> 06:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
handed out to you with my testimony one
 
06:08:50.150 --> 06:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the pieces of analysis that I wanted
 
06:08:52.590 --> 06:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
to provide to today is how have our
 
06:08:55.070 --> 06:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates done so since State
 
06:08:57.830 --> 06:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2000 from St fiscal year
 
06:09:01.310 --> 06:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
2000 to 2023 our estimates were about
 
06:09:03.910 --> 06:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
$75 million low each year that's about
 
06:09:07.230 --> 06:09:07.240 align:start position:0%
3% low each year um the absolute value
 
06:09:09.510 --> 06:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
of the error so that that averages you
 
06:09:11.070 --> 06:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
know the pluses and the minuses are
 
06:09:13.230 --> 06:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
average out um if you look at the
 
06:09:14.510 --> 06:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
absolute value of the error the
 
06:09:17.110 --> 06:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
magnitude of the error was about
 
06:09:21.510 --> 06:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
$14.7 million each year or 5.1% error um
 
06:09:23.390 --> 06:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
so again you know not not massive we're
 
06:09:26.270 --> 06:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
not talking 15 or 20% error but a 5%
 
06:09:29.390 --> 06:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
error if we remove the last four years
 
06:09:30.830 --> 06:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
out of the average error because it's
 
06:09:33.070 --> 06:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
been very difficult to forecast if you
 
06:09:34.270 --> 06:09:34.280 align:start position:0%
look on the graph you'll see that it's
 
06:09:36.190 --> 06:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
been very difficult to forecast revenues
 
06:09:38.190 --> 06:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
since the pandemic struck if we remove
 
06:09:40.030 --> 06:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
those four years then the average error
 
06:09:43.590 --> 06:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
is 31.1 million or 1.5% and the absolute
 
06:09:45.628 --> 06:09:45.638 align:start position:0%
error is 80 million or
 
06:09:48.910 --> 06:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
3.6% now that 75 million does not
 
06:09:50.670 --> 06:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily represent the entire state
 
06:09:52.628 --> 06:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
budget impact it may you know Sound
 
06:09:53.948 --> 06:09:53.958 align:start position:0%
small in the grand scheme of the general
 
06:09:56.948 --> 06:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
and education trust funds but um and in
 
06:09:59.310 --> 06:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
scheme of a $6 billion year state budget
 
06:10:01.468 --> 06:10:01.478 align:start position:0%
or now $7 billion year state budget but
 
06:10:02.990 --> 06:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
those General funds can also be used to
 
06:10:04.910 --> 06:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
match Medicaid dollars for example so
 
06:10:06.708 --> 06:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an impact that goes
 
06:10:08.670 --> 06:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
beyond just the amount of Revenue
 
06:10:11.548 --> 06:10:11.558 align:start position:0%
projection that was um in error so to
 
06:10:14.390 --> 06:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
speak uh so you know if those dollars
 
06:10:16.510 --> 06:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
were used to match with Medicaid then it
 
06:10:17.750 --> 06:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
would double the amount of federal
 
06:10:19.350 --> 06:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
dollars double the amount of dollars
 
06:10:21.030 --> 06:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
that come into the state budget because
 
06:10:23.830 --> 06:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
of those Federal matching funds so with
 
06:10:26.708 --> 06:10:26.718 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to not pull any more from
 
06:10:27.990 --> 06:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
this document that I gave you but this
 
06:10:30.070 --> 06:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
document is also online on our website
 
06:10:32.468 --> 06:10:32.478 align:start position:0%
at nhp.org and I'm happy to take any
 
06:10:34.910 --> 06:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
questions the committee may have thank
 
06:10:39.230 --> 06:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
you for your concise testimony um
 
06:10:39.240 --> 06:10:40.750 align:start position:0%
you for your concise testimony um
anyone

06:10:40.750 --> 06:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
06:10:44.310 --> 06:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
have applicable questions I think I
 
06:10:46.030 --> 06:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
think we're all at the end of the day
 
06:10:49.270 --> 06:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
here um I appreciate your time no um as
 
06:10:51.868 --> 06:10:51.878 align:start position:0%
questions come up um I'm assuming that
 
06:10:54.510 --> 06:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
we can reach you either through uh
 
06:10:56.990 --> 06:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative Aly or directly yes you
 
06:10:58.468 --> 06:10:58.478 align:start position:0%
can reach me directly my contact
 
06:11:00.310 --> 06:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
information is on the last page at the
 
06:11:02.270 --> 06:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page on the packet that I
 
06:11:04.070 --> 06:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
just provided excellent well thank you
 
06:11:06.110 --> 06:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
very much for coming I appreciate it um
 
06:11:09.350 --> 06:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
representative Wy you would like a wrap
 
06:11:13.350 --> 06:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
up a quick wrap
 
06:11:17.190 --> 06:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
up emphasis on the quick part yes well
 
06:11:19.590 --> 06:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
actually it wasn't a wrap up I wanted to
 
06:11:22.830 --> 06:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
point out that state
 
06:11:25.548 --> 06:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
debt is our
 
06:11:25.558 --> 06:11:28.110 align:start position:0%
debt is our
bonding

06:11:28.110 --> 06:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
bonding
 
06:11:32.548 --> 06:11:32.558 align:start position:0%
and uh some and the way to look at that
 
06:11:35.788 --> 06:11:35.798 align:start position:0%
debt is the relationship between the
 
06:11:40.270 --> 06:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
amount of debt and the amount of
 
06:11:43.788 --> 06:11:43.798 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we have to pay it off right
 
06:11:48.150 --> 06:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
but it's long-term debt that is put into
 
06:11:50.990 --> 06:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
building the infrastructure of the
 
06:11:55.548 --> 06:11:55.558 align:start position:0%
state and um I was a little upset
 
06:11:58.868 --> 06:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
because uh I know the senior senator
 
06:12:00.990 --> 06:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
from Utah through
 
06:12:05.270 --> 06:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
ncsl who is incredibly well respected in
 
06:12:08.590 --> 06:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
the financial area because they do such
 
06:12:12.708 --> 06:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
a great job of this uh Massachusetts I
 
06:12:17.030 --> 06:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
won't I won't talk about much I have uh
 
06:12:18.868 --> 06:12:18.878 align:start position:0%
I have one more question for you if you
 
06:12:22.150 --> 06:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind um with your experience of
 
06:12:24.270 --> 06:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
the of the bills that come
 
06:12:26.990 --> 06:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
through this um
 
06:12:31.230 --> 06:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
Sausage Factory in a in a term what um
 
06:12:35.868 --> 06:12:35.878 align:start position:0%
what percentage or how many um would
 
06:12:40.628 --> 06:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
be likely to be um benefit from a
 
06:12:40.638 --> 06:12:44.670 align:start position:0%
be likely to be um benefit from a
longitudinal

06:12:44.670 --> 06:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:48.548 --> 06:12:48.558 align:start position:0%
study that would uh be a very subjective
 
06:12:50.468 --> 06:12:50.478 align:start position:0%
thing I think that's what I'm asking
 
06:12:52.868 --> 06:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
that's on that's
 
06:12:55.948 --> 06:12:55.958 align:start position:0%
why we've got for the performance audits
 
06:12:58.868 --> 06:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
which is the word I was kind of pull out
 
06:13:02.310 --> 06:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
of my brain before and we've got a group
 
06:13:06.150 --> 06:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
of people that make decisions on whether
 
06:13:09.070 --> 06:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
one should be done or not and why I
 
06:13:13.510 --> 06:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
think that that it should be a
 
06:13:17.270 --> 06:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
group that has to decide with four
 
06:13:22.548 --> 06:13:22.558 align:start position:0%
people on each side to uh which um of
 
06:13:24.708 --> 06:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
the projects
 
06:13:27.390 --> 06:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
that that ought to be looked
 
06:13:31.670 --> 06:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
at and it would also be limited by um
 
06:13:34.910 --> 06:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about at this point one
 
06:13:38.468 --> 06:13:38.478 align:start position:0%
person there is one person in Employment
 
06:13:42.910 --> 06:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
Security that is working with this and I
 
06:13:46.310 --> 06:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
think he may have a little help help on
 
06:13:49.390 --> 06:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
some stuff I'm not sure but I do know
 
06:13:52.708 --> 06:13:52.718 align:start position:0%
that he doesn't if he isn't there to
 
06:13:55.270 --> 06:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
answer the phone in his
 
06:13:59.708 --> 06:13:59.718 align:start position:0%
office uh not answered so
 
06:13:59.718 --> 06:14:01.948 align:start position:0%
office uh not answered so
on

06:14:01.948 --> 06:14:01.958 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:14:07.110 --> 06:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
the the we would be depending um in the
 
06:14:09.350 --> 06:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
early days we would have to find the
 
06:14:11.788 --> 06:14:11.798 align:start position:0%
right person to be doing this I would
 
06:14:14.310 --> 06:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
love it if Brian golo would move over
 
06:14:17.110 --> 06:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
but um I'm not sure how many more years
 
06:14:21.390 --> 06:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
he wants to be in service uh all right
 
06:14:23.990 --> 06:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
um well if we can't if we don't have an
 
06:14:28.270 --> 06:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
idea of how big a a problem this is um
 
06:14:30.350 --> 06:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
or well or
 
06:14:32.750 --> 06:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity that's the that we could
 
06:14:35.788 --> 06:14:35.798 align:start position:0%
expand it to be twice the size of LBA if
 
06:14:38.110 --> 06:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
we wanted to but I don't think that's a
 
06:14:41.390 --> 06:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire idea I don't think so all
 
06:14:43.150 --> 06:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
right uh thank you very much for
 
06:14:46.150 --> 06:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward um with that I'll
 
06:14:51.030 --> 06:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on um on this bill
 
06:14:55.868 --> 06:14:55.878 align:start position:0%

06:15:06.030 --> 06:15:06.040 align:start position:0%

06:15:09.390 --> 06:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
caucusing um prior to that so that we
 
06:15:16.190 --> 06:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
