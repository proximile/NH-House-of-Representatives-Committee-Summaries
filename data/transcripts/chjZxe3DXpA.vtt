agreements for for default
 
00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 align:start position:0%
service with the agreement of the
 
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
ranking member we have also decided to
 
00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
exec House Bill
 
00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 align:start position:0%
1627 relative to
 
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
rodifer railroads transportation and
 
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications we will be hearing
 
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
that bill later this morning so that's
 
00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
the schedule for our activity today and
 
00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 align:start position:0%
so before we start our first public
 
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
hearing I would ask if there are any
 
00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 align:start position:0%
matters that members of the committee
 
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
begin seeing none I guess we can begin
 
00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to open a public hearing on
 
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
1036 relative to assessment of cost
 
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the system's benefits
 
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
charge and I'm going to ask the prime
 
00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this legislation to introduce
 
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
Harrington representative Arington the
 
00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
yours and I'd remind you representative
 
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
that we need a pink card from you not
 
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 align:start position:0%
right this minute
 
00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
off well thank you Mr chairman good
 
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.270 align:start position:0%
off well thank you Mr chairman good
morning

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
everybody hope no one died from the
 
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
death storm because I mean after all
 
00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 align:start position:0%
according to channel 9 if we get 2 Ines
 
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
of snow we should just hide in that
 
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
basement um anyways this bill what it
 
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
does is basically allows more
 
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
flexibility to the Pu we set this uh uh
 
00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 align:start position:0%
the way it was written before was
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
basically said in the past saying that
 
00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
they had to con continue with the method
 
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
for reviewing cost Effectiveness on the
 
00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
um assistant benefit charg and we I
 
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
don't see the need to to keep the the Pu
 
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh in this locked into the past way of
 
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
doing things uh that was done a few
 
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
years ago and the plan will last for a
 
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
few more years this simply says allow
 
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
more flexibility so that they can look
 
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
longer term at this and see if there's
 
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
maybe a better way of doing it the uh
 
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
you know the legislature of course takes
 
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit longer to get things done
 
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
so if we wanted to change this it could
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
take upwards of a year by the time you
 
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
get through this house and the Senate
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
and the governor and everything when the
 
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
Pu has a lot more flexibility if there
 
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
was some changes they could have
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
hearings and move the process up and the
 
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
Pu and the department of energy will
 
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
both speak on this later so I'm going to
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
defer most of it to them but I think
 
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
it's just a good it's a good turn uh
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
tool to give them more flexibility I
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
mean that's what we pay them to be there
 
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
for so they can evaluate these issues
 
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
rather than lock them into a methodology
 
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to be four or five years
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
old by the time they revisit this again
 
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
so again I'd say I'd defer most of the
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
questions to them unless someone has
 
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
something specific for me
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Harrington for
 
00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill I have one quick
 
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
question the way the bill is constructed
 
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
on lines two and
 
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
three it strikes four words and those
 
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
four words would mean that the entire
 
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph would only apply to the filing
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
that was made on March 1st 2022 is that
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
correct yes that is correct okay thank
 
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the
 
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
committee representative Kaplan has
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chair and thank you rep
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington for taking my
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
question um the analysis says that it
 
00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
modifies the this bill modifies the
 
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
assessment but I don't know who wrote
 
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
that it seems to eliminate the
 
00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
assessment uh completely
 
00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
so my question is you know you you say
 
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
it gives the Pu greater flexibility but
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
what problem are you trying to solve
 
00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 align:start position:0%
what is the problem with this
 
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
methodology and what repl I mean how can
 
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
we just strike you know a methodology of
 
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
assessing the cost Effectiveness without
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
having something in place isn't it a
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
good idea to assess the cost
 
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness yeah the intent is not to
 
00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:16.759 align:start position:0%
get rid of the cost Effectiveness it's
 
00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 align:start position:0%
just to give them more flexibility to do
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
that so we have right now it says
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
forever and ever you should use this
 
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
methodology that was developed I think
 
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
in 2020 or something like that I don't
 
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
have the exact date but again the other
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
speak because we'll have that
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
information and lock Us in Forever is
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
that's the way to do it this would
 
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
simply say we allow them F they still
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
have to do it but they allow the
 
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
flexibility with changing situations to
 
00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
maybe use different metrics or whatever
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
it it certainly doesn't eliminate it
 
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
because we want to they've been doing
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
that for well at least the 20 years I've
 
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
been involved in this they've been
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
presenting that doing it and presenting
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
it to the legislature and want that to
 
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
continue but it just allows them to say
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
two years from now maybe there's a
 
00:07:58.149 --> 00:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
different methodology we should be using
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
to determine the effectiveness that's
 
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
all yeah follow up follow up my question
 
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
is what is wrong can you I mean is there
 
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
what problem is this trying to solve
 
00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:09.639 align:start position:0%
with the old methodology like well it's
 
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
trying to solve the problem of not being
 
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
allowing any flexibility and changes
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
with time so if three years from now the
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
Pu says we can improve the way we do
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
this to get more accurate results they
 
00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:22.599 align:start position:0%
locked into a methodology that was set
 
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
in I whatever it was 2020 or something
 
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
like that and this would allow them to
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
change that and say okay here's a better
 
00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
way of doing this maybe I don't know
 
00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:32.519 align:start position:0%
maybe Nebraska did some studies and
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
found out there's a better way to to to
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
analyze this and get more accurate
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
results and we'd want to follow that it
 
00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:40.039 align:start position:0%
just gives them flexibility that's
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
all further questions from the committee
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington for taking my
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
question um so from the description that
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
you've given your your answer is that
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
changing the language removing on lines
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
two and three and future plan offerings
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
would mean in statute that uh our
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
practice of using the granite state test
 
00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:09.320 align:start position:0%
is the primary test and the Total
 
00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
Resource cost test as a secondary test
 
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
would be eliminated from the
 
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
requirements in terms of the
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
statute it would be eliminated from a
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
requirement but not eliminated as a tool
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
it would allow the Pu the flexibility to
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
say we've looked around there is no
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
better way to do this we're going to
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
continue to do it the same way or it
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
would say
 
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
we want to change this a little bit
 
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
because we found some other metrics that
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
give more accurate results of this so it
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't eliminate anything it just
 
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
allows flexibility followup followup so
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
along those lines I guess I will be able
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
to ask other speakers that are coming up
 
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
afterwards though but weren't these two
 
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
tests sort of hard fought for hard one
 
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:52.519 align:start position:0%
in terms of determining which way we
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
should be assessing costs in other words
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
there's already been a whole process in
 
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
order to get us to the point where we're
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
using these as tools correct at the time
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
that is correct but it's it's dated now
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
and it'll be much more dated when it's
 
00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:05.959 align:start position:0%
Revisited in a couple of years so I'm
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
just saying it may be the evaluation
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
comes out to keep it exactly the same
 
00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
the whole point of this is to give the
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
Pu uh more flexibility to look at things
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
that might have changed over time or
 
00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:19.959 align:start position:0%
better methods that were developed by
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
whoever Vice chair Thomas has a question
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr thank you for taking my
 
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:26.839 align:start position:0%
question just to reiterate what you said
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
earlier and to paraphrase what what
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
you're were saying uh you're basically
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
saying that it kind of takes away the
 
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
old feeling of of people saying we've
 
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
always done this way so why change it it
 
00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:41.959 align:start position:0%
makes that statement say maybe there is
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
a better way some on time I have to
 
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
agree with that yes
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions representative
 
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
Bernardi has a
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh were you
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
the primary author of this or were you
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
asked to do this by the people I was
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
asked by do8 thank
 
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the
 
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none I want to thank
 
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington for
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
introducing this legislation and next
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
I'll call on Alex spidel from the New
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Utilities Commission to
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
testify on this legis proposed
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
legislation welcome to stn Good Morning
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
Good Morning uh thank you chairman V and
 
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for having me
 
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission on these
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
issues today I am Alex spidel a senior
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
advisor and attorney at the
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
commission uh in the interest of
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
enabling others to have time to get
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
their points across and as I have other
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
testimonial responsibilities before the
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
Senate this morning I will be brief the
 
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
commission is broadly supportive of the
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
legislature continuing to set the
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
overall System benefit charge budget as
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
it removes a locust of controversy
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
regarding overall spending that is best
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
handled by the ultimate budgeting
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
Authority the general court through its
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
enactments that said the commission
 
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
would encourage this committee and the
 
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
legislature at large to consider
 
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
adopting an approach that would return
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
to what prevailed before
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
2021 on the issue of the pu's assessment
 
00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:20.839 align:start position:0%
of cost Effectiveness for utility Energy
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
Efficiency in line with the traditional
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory model that applied to this
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
field from the turn of this century this
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
approach would be applied to the next
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
trianal plan cycle beginning in
 
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
2027 in our view it is important for the
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
commission to make sure that the people
 
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire who are paying for
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
these programs through the system
 
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
benefits charge are actually benefiting
 
00:12:47.069 --> 00:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
from these
 
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
programs the amount of money being spent
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
by the utilities with rap pair funds in
 
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
a tri-annual plan cycle is large
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
approximately a quar billion
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
dollars the commission indicated in its
 
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
recent trianal plan order that it had
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
some concerns in the areas of being able
 
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
to assess cost Effectiveness
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
properly the commission believes that
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
being able to apply proven economic
 
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
Concepts such as discount rates that
 
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
accurately reflect the time value of
 
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
money and cost benefit ratios informed
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
by empirical economic studies and
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the commission are important
 
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
for the goal of getting these programs
 
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
right and doing what's best for New
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire making sure that the regulated
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
utility monopolies are spending the rate
 
00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:38.839 align:start position:0%
payers money wisely is what we at the
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
puc do and have done through the system
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
benefit charge dockets in the past 20
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
years as of now for the most recent Tri
 
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
annual plan 97% of the spending is not
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
subject to the commission's
 
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
scrutiny from that angle the commission
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
also supports the remarks made by the
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
department of energy Representatives
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner Elms and Dr AR today many
 
00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:09.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you questions for Mr
 
00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:17.759 align:start position:0%
spidel representative Bernardi has a
 
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair so in
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
summary you concur or not concur with
 
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
this Bill yes representative Bernardi I
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
was cautious because I hadn't read the
 
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:31.240 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill before I had
 
00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
arrived I had seen an earlier version of
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
it online then it went away over the
 
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
long weekend so when I read it I said
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
yes this would effectuate essentially
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
giving the commission its flexibility to
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
consider future plans using its
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
traditional economic analysis approach
 
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative McGee
 
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chair um my
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
question is around the decisions that we
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
made to try and stabilize funding under
 
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.240 align:start position:0%
HB 549 in 2022 so um there was an effort
 
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
by this committee to try and determine a
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
way to put something in statute that
 
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.350 align:start position:0%
way to put something in statute that
would

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
satisfy uh the stability of the New
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves program and how it's
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
funded and also to give Clarity around
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
if there are going to be increases what
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
they would be so there would be you know
 
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
a modest um but uh sort of market-based
 
00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
increases as part of the statute so what
 
00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
does that do to to that decision and
 
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
that effort if we sort of undo it with
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
this um I think that you're referring to
 
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
the overall budget being set by the
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
general court and as I indicated my
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
remarks the commission supports that
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
because ultimately the system benefits
 
00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:53.319 align:start position:0%
charge is akin to the legislature's
 
00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:55.959 align:start position:0%
budget setting Authority and so that is
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
the general court making decision this
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
is the overall spending level and so we
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
support that remaining the way as it is
 
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
and so what I see in Mr Harrington's
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
bill is that it is not uh implicated
 
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
what is implicated is the possibility of
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
examining questions like discount rates
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
and I'll explain why that's significant
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
I representative Harrington he referred
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
at an earlier Point uh this morning to
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
the fact that some of the data is dated
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
uh that was fed into these economic
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
tests that are specified in the language
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
of this older 2122 bill um the discount
 
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
rates that applied they were derived
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
from a Time roughly 2016 when we had a
 
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
zero interest rate policy inflation was
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
practically zero GDP growth was
 
00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
practically zero it was a stagnant
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
period and so the cost of money was
 
00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
hardly anything it was very small but
 
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
now we've been moving through a higher
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
inflation period so when you feed in
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
those data points into the models for
 
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
assessing cost Effectiveness it comes
 
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
out with uh results that are not really
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
accurate so the idea is that going
 
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
forward we would ask experts from the
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
utilities from the Department of energy
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
from uh the office of the consumer
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
Advocate other parties that are
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
interested in participating in trianal
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
plan dockets here we are in
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
2026 what is the good discount rate for
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
2027 and we'll see where the economics
 
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:19.959 align:start position:0%
comes out we may come back to a a low
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
inflation low growth economy again in
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
the future but we might not we may have
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
a high inflation economy that would feed
 
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
into a different outcome for assessing
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
these discount rates does that help your
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
answer your
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
question follow up thank you Mr chair
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
and so um the follow on question would
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
be the discount rates and other aspects
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
of the trianal plan when they they still
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
go in front of the Pu so all those
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
members to the docket would still have
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
input right yes so I guess before I
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
finish because this is my last question
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
um I guess what I'm trying to get at is
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
I I still don't see the need for this
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
change in language for us to effectuate
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
a way of modifying plans when they're
 
00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
submitted to the Pu I don't see how
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
they're prohibited from already asking
 
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
those questions and determining those
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
things so if I may uh Madame
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative I can give you the order
 
00:18:20.149 --> 00:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
citation uh for everyone to mark down
 
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
it's order number 26908 and it's from
 
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
26908 and it's from uh November the 30th
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
2023 and docket de
 
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
23068 and there's a lot built into there
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
so the commission had to assess the
 
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
meaning of what the general court had
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
said in the enactments that came about
 
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
and one of the implications if you read
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
the law carefully is that all of the
 
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
metrics and this was Amplified actually
 
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
by the parties that were participating
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
in the docket for this trienal plan
 
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
everything was frozen in place not
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
really even in the way of uh 2020 but
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
rather 2016 outputs
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
considerations uh conditions were being
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
baked in to the 2024 trianal plan so
 
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately unless something like uh
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
representative herings bill goes through
 
00:19:16.919 --> 00:19:18.470 align:start position:0%
representative herings bill goes through
in

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
2027 the commission is going to be stuck
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
with having to apply discount rates and
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
other subparts that were baked in 11
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
years before that in a total different
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
world representative Ms has a question
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question there there are a
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
number of different
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
um I guess measurement criteria cost
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
studies uh tests that are referenced in
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
this um in this statute is there a
 
00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
particular one that is of most
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
concern I mean I I see the you know the
 
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
avoided energy supply cost study the
 
00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:04.039 align:start position:0%
granted state test the Total Resource
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
cost test is there any one of those
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's a particular concern I would
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
answer that in general they all have
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
good aspects but the problem is the
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
dated assumptions surrounding discount
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
rates really are the real issue so they
 
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
have um phrases that make sense Within
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
These examples such as you must have a
 
00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:29.799 align:start position:0%
cost benefit ratio of at least one that
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
sounds good but if you're feeding in a
 
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
discount rate that was in a context of 1
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
a half% or 1% inflation to a 9%
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
inflation economy the results from those
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
relatively robust tests end up as uh
 
00:20:50.669 --> 00:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
less than accurate followup followup um
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
so the are the are the discount rate
 
00:20:55.159 --> 00:20:56.470 align:start position:0%
so the are the are the discount rate
rates

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
specifically set in these tests I mean
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
does it say specifically that you must
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
use a discount rate of 1% or does it or
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
does it say you know what the prevailing
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
discount rate is well the the language
 
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
of the 2022 Bill said that you have to
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
feed in all of the subpart assumptions
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
that were in play in the last trianal
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
plan so that included the discount rates
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
in general terms and I um Mr chairman I
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
can take one or two more questions but
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
then I must go to the Senate if it's all
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
right yes uh we'll allow one more
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
question from representative Kaplan
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and this is a quick
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
question following up on representative
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
M's question wouldn't it be easier to uh
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
place instead of eliminating uh the the
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
cost Effectiveness studies altoe
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be easier to just amend the
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
statute by adding the need to uh take
 
00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
into effect take into account the latest
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
discount rate studies just say you must
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%
rates I would take that under advisement
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
to be sure that discount rates aren't
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
the only field of play that we were
 
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
struggling with as a commission in
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
applying the old um methodologies that
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
were in place in the last trianal plan
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
into this current trianal plan um that
 
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
would be worth a consideration but what
 
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
is attractive about representative
 
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
Harrington's approach is that really
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
leaves it even more open-ended and that
 
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
it short circuits the imposition of the
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
past elements of the
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
tests for future trianal plans it it
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
enables a more broad ranging broad
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
reaching examination of all the
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
assumptions that are presented the
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
amount of money that is involved is so
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
significant that when you have 97% of
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
the plans baked in and not capable of
 
00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
modification by the commission not not
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
on overall spend but on allocation in
 
00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
particular it it leads to
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
issues all right thank you uh can I
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
follow up with a quick followup though
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
make it quick yeah okay thank you Mr
 
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
chair but you in a previous uh question
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
you said you didn't really see problems
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
with the other elements of the
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
methodology so can you be more specific
 
00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
about the the concerns you might have
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
with the other elements thank you well I
 
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily say that I had no
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
problems in terms of uh the the the
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
thing is is that if you examine the the
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
language of the last bill and how it
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
applied in the context of this current
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
trianal plan as explain in the order
 
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799 align:start position:0%
that I cited the legislature literally
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
locked into
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
place a lot of different spending
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
elements a lot of different plan
 
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
elements and it's hard to summarize and
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
I would recommend that everyone look
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
over the order and you can kind of get a
 
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
granular summary there but when you
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
freeze everything in place based on what
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
was done in the last trianal plan and
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
the commission is only allowed to review
 
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
3% of the spending for their different
 
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
modification elements it's very
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
difficult and if you for fast forward
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
that to yet another four-year time
 
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
Horizon if you're talking about from
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
2023 all the way to
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
2027 and that language of that
 
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
legislation is still in place all those
 
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
years later it can it would lead to a
 
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
lot of potential lost opportunities for
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency in New
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um okay thank you we really
 
00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate you uh coming to speak to the
 
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
committee this morning and we'll let you
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
go because we know you have other
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities thank you thank you
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
very much Mr
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
chairman all right so we'll move on now
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
and I'll call the next uh folks who want
 
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
to speak with us and that's the depart
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
Department of energy represented by
 
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
assistant uh commissioner Chris Elms and
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
Dr Dean
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
yours good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
my name is Chris Elms I'm the Deputy
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and I'm joined by
 
00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
Dr Dina Reef who is a PhD Economist and
 
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
the director of natural gas regulation
 
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
at the department of energy so we are
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
here today in support of House Bill 1036
 
00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
uh as you heard this bill would remove
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
the statutory
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
restrictions uh on the Pu to make any
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
changes to Energy Efficiency cost
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness tests going forward uh the
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
point that I'm going to discuss uh
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
briefly here is is similar to um our
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
testimony last week on House Bill 1617
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
which is frankly how far into the weeds
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
of of utility regulation does the
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
legislature want to dive so to give you
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
a little context and we heard a little
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
bit about this you know most of us I
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
think remember the puc's order in the
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
2021 through 2023 trianal Energy
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
Efficiency plan that led to House Bill
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
549 uh you know so in response to that
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
decision the legislature passed and and
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
Governor sonunu signed House Bill 549
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
and in that bill the legislature took
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
over control of the funding of of rapair
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
funded Energy Efficiency program
 
00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
and also brought in these other
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
restrictions uh that we talked about
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about today uh you
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
know the department was supportive of
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 549 and we worked hard with
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative Vos to both craft uh the
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
First Amendment to House Bill 549 which
 
00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
was a retained Bill and then the more
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
exp expansive amendment that came in in
 
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
the Senate where these restrictions were
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
added and that was you know due in large
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
part because at the time the governor
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
and the house and the Senate um were all
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
very clear that they wanted to make sure
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
that the situation was resolved
 
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
expeditiously and with little room for
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation and that short-term
 
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
Focus uh was successful we were able to
 
00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:09.559 align:start position:0%
resolve the issues but the circumstances
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
in in developing that bill and that
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
expedited process made a statute that is
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
probably overly restrictive and is a bit
 
00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:19.799 align:start position:0%
clunky um you know most notably the bill
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
mandates coste Effectiveness as being
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
determined by uh you know the tests that
 
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
you see in statute there the granite
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
state test uh is is the primary test uh
 
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
a little history there the granite state
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
test was worked on and analyzed by a
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
benefit cost working group that was
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
directed by the Pu to file
 
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations on costeffective Energy
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs uh and that test was
 
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
adopted by the Pu in late 2019 December
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
2019 uh this Committee in House Bill 549
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
did not review the those those
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
restrictions that were placed the the
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
amendment that you had passed in House
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
Bill 549 and the house pH just dealt
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
with the budgets those came in in the
 
00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
Senate phase um you
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
know following House Bill 5 49's passage
 
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
the Pu approved a plan for the remainder
 
00:28:11.789 --> 00:28:11.799 align:start position:0%
of the 21 through 23 triennial plan work
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
began on the 24 through 226 triennial
 
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency plan and as uh Mr
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
spidel referenced that order uh on
 
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
November 30th has set those programs for
 
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
the next three years this bill is really
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
about the next trienal plan 27 through
 
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
29 and and Beyond the work will start on
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
that in
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
2026 um now is the opportune time for us
 
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
to look at the statutory framework and
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
decide frankly whether or not the
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to be as involved uh
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
in in the intricacies of cost
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness tests um and Dr Reef is
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
going to spend some time talking about
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
uh the cost Effectiveness tests that are
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
in play in statute and some of those
 
00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:54.519 align:start position:0%
factors like discount rates that we
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
heard from Mr spidel so I'm going to
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Deputy Commissioner Elms for
 
00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
giving me the
 
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
floor I would like to begin by thanking
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative Vose the chair and all
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
the honorable members of the House
 
00:29:18.909 --> 00:29:18.919 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
for giving me this opportunity today to
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
speak the primary topic of my discussion
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
today is the the cost Effectiveness
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
tests namely the granite state test or
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
GST as I would be referring to them time
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
to time and the Total Resource cost test
 
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.430 align:start position:0%
to time and the Total Resource cost test
or

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
trct as they are referenced in the
 
00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
current version of the law RSA 374 df3
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 6- a
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
subd what I would like to accomplish is
 
00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
to bring certain Tech Technical and
 
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
practical observations to your
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
consideration all in light of how the
 
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
current version of the law has been
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
interpreted by various stakeholders and
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
how they have tried putting it into
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
practice a quick
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
caveat what I'm about to tell you is a
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
perspective informed by research and
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
observations by learning through
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
interactions with other stakeholders and
 
00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
from relevant documents such as the puc
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
orders the Consulting reports from
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
working groups back in 2027 to 2021
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
period and learning from the
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
investigatory docket and Energy
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
Efficiency docket
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
processes as such I have relied upon
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
those documents and would do the very
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
best to provide appropriate
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.750 align:start position:0%
best to provide appropriate
references

with that caveat let me allow let me
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
offer you an overview of the Granite
 
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
State and Total Resource cost
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
test at this point I would
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
kindly require or ask you request you to
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
look at page one of the handout that's
 
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.269 align:start position:0%
look at page one of the handout that's
been

00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.629 --> 00:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
provided the granite state test is
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
identified as the primary test test
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
along with the Total Resource cost test
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
which is the secondary test essentially
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
they are the benefit to cost ratios used
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
to identify if the benefits from
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
undertaking certain programs outweigh
 
00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:45.950 align:start position:0%
undertaking certain programs outweigh
their

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
costs leading to a recommendation for
 
00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:52.039 align:start position:0%
adoption and implementation of those
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
programs and vice
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
versa the underlying principles for or
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
any benefit cost test generally speaking
 
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.350 align:start position:0%
any benefit cost test generally speaking
are

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
two first the input to benefits and cost
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
should be similar meaning if benefits
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
from an input is captured the costs
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
incurred to achieve those benefits
 
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
should also be
 
00:32:23.629 --> 00:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
captured and the same treatment should
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
be accorded in calculating the net
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
present value value of benefit and cost
 
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
streams when they span over multiple
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
years this generally implies that the
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
same discount Factor value be used for
 
00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
discounting benefit and cost
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
streams the absence of adherence to
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
these principles would lead to a biased
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
benefit to cost ratio
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
outcomes this in turn would lead to
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation of programs which should
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
not be perhaps
 
00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:03.799 align:start position:0%
implemented the relevant question
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
therefore are what does it mean in the
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
context of New Hampshire's Energy
 
00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:13.399 align:start position:0%

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
included in the GST and trct tests to
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
see that please refer to page two of the
 
00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:27.559 align:start position:0%
handout this page provides
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
a quick overview of the inputs in the
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
Total Resource cost test of version of
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
which was amended to become the granite
 
00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
state test this is sourced from the
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
evaluation measurement and verification
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%

2019 the figure shows what components
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
are fed into these two
 
00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.710 align:start position:0%
are fed into these two
tests

00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
as you can see the key differences are
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
two all utility system impacts were
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
adopted into the current granite state
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
test this includes among others the
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
active demand reduction Reduction
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
Program that now graduated from being a
 
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
pilot to a full program in the most

2024 26
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
the other key difference is that all
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
participant impacts were excluded into
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
the primary granite state
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
test in the context of the benefit to
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
cost ratio what does that mean the
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
answer would require a little closer
 
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
attention to what makes up the benefits
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
and cost streams a summary is provided

as you can
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
see towards the bottom of the

page between the Total Resource cost
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
test and the granite state test the cost
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
streams does not include any participant
 
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
cost however non energy benefits by plan
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
participants are captured in the benefit
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
stream as was mentioned on page 86 of
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
the proposed proposed and now approved

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
proposed by The Joint
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
utilities this in indicates that the
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
fundamental principle underlying the
 
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
benefit to cost ratio test is not
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily reflected in the current
 
00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
granite state test which is not a best
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
practice the other fundamental principle
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
underlying the benefit to to cost ratio
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
test is the consistent application of
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
the discount rate to both the benefit
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
and cost streams the discount rate
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
aligns the trickling benefit and cost
 
00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:15.079 align:start position:0%
streams that are spread over multiple
 
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
years into the current year dollar
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
values simply put the higher the
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
discount rate the lower the Net Present
 
00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:28.599 align:start position:0%
Value since today's dollars are
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
generally generally regarded more
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
valuable than the future
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
dollars as such the discount rate and
 
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
the inputs leading to the calculation
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
and or choice of the discount rate is
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
significantly important this generally
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
implies three things first the same
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
methodology and value should be used in
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
calculating the net present value for
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
both the benefit and cost streams
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
secondly attention care and effort
 
00:37:04.829 --> 00:37:04.839 align:start position:0%
should be given to align the time frame
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
for inputs that are used in developing
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
the discount
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
rate and finally attention should be
 
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079 align:start position:0%
accorded in selecting the appropriate
 
00:37:17.079 --> 00:37:18.550 align:start position:0%
accorded in selecting the appropriate
discount

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
discount
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
rate please allow me to unpack a little
 
00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:22.430 align:start position:0%
rate please allow me to unpack a little
bit

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
more the first Criterion the
 
00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:29.079 align:start position:0%
methodological consistency implies that
 
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
the same value of the discount rate be
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
used in The Net Present Value
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
calculation for both the benefit and the
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
cost streams the second Criterion the
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
alignment of time frame for inputs to
 
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
discount rate implies that efforts
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
should be exerted to align input values
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
that make up the nominal discount rate
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
the inflation rate and their use in
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
calcul calculating the real discount
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
rate generally speaking real discount
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
rate is the nominal discount rate minus
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
the inflation
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
rate taken together these
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
simply this these imply if one discount
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
rate value is used to calculate the net
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
present value of benefits and a separate
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
value is used to calculate the net
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
present value of cost
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
the resulting benefit to cost ratio and
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
therefore the derived recommendations
 
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
thereof would be less than accurate the
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
granite state test is misaligned in its
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
current application which was confirmed
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
by the utilities during the
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
hearings utilities confirmed that the
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
nominal cost stream is derived using
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
inflation adjusted system benefits
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
charge and local delivery adjustment
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
chars and the nominal benefit stream is
 
00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
derived using the inflation adjusted
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
avoided energy supply cost from
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
2021 the utilities also confirmed that
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
while the real discount rate is used to
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
derive program benefits program costs
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
were discounted using the nominal
 
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
discount rate Additionally the timing of
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
the nominal discount rate is different
 
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
from that of the inflation rate while
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
utilities used prime rate from June
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
2023 as the nominal discount rate they
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
used quarter 1 of 2022 through quarter 1
 
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.109 align:start position:0%

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
identified this
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
misalignment in their recent order the
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
methodological deficiencies and their
 
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
less than accurate
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
application in the current 2024 2026
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency plan was referenced
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
into that same order as well yet the
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
majority of the commission felt they
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
lacked the legal Authority to make any
 
00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:29.349 align:start position:0%
lacked the legal Authority to make any
meaningful

00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
changes the third Criterion is
 
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
highlighted as I highlighted
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
earlier is the appropriateness of the
 
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
chosen discount rate it is clear that
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
the discount rate plays a pivotal role
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
in identifying right set of programs via
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
the granite state test the relevant
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
question here therefore is what discount
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
rate is
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate this was invoked to be
 
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.710 align:start position:0%
appropriate this was invoked to be
addressed

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
in in
 
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.510 align:start position:0%
in in
[Music]

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
um in the commission Leed investigative
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
22042 where all interested stakeholders
 
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders provided their
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
input um in the interest of time um if
 
00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
you want me to summarize I can I can do
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
so and I I would like to have some
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
questions um that you you may have um I
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
do have a little bit of a lengthy
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
um testimony but I would um I can
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
summarize and we can go over to the next
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
phase or I can continue whichever way
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
you feel comfortable cheerful thank you
 
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
that was uh extremely Illuminating
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
testimony we appreciate you offering it
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
I do have one
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
question since Net Present Value seems
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
to be one of the big sticking points in
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
determining whether these calculations
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
of costs and benefits are correct or not
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
could you give us a quick summary as
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
quick as you can about what's wrong with
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
The Net Present Value chosen by the plan
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
implementers and what the Pu sees
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
as what the Net Present Value probably
 
00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.150 align:start position:0%
as what the Net Present Value probably
should

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
be thank you for that question um in
 
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
Reading relevant documents um and in
 
00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:45.559 align:start position:0%
particular the order from the Pu it
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
appeared to me that uh it is both the
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
choice of different rates and the time
 
00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.670 align:start position:0%
choice of different rates and the time
frame

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
frame
 
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
used um which were misaligned as I was
 
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
saying could lead to different values of
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
Net Present Value depending on whether
 
00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
the same Net Present Value um that same
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
discount rate is applied to the benefits
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
and cost streams so the way it was um it
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
appears to have been done is that the
 
00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
net present value for benefits may have
 
00:43:25.599 --> 00:43:27.870 align:start position:0%
net present value for benefits may have
been

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
inflated relatively speaking to the cost
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
of uh how it was done so when you take
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
something which is which is a little bit
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
higher than uh the cost of it and you
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
try to um you try to find out a ratio of
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
that and trying to see if it is greater
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
than one it would generally lead to more
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
than one that is what that is
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:56.630 align:start position:0%
than one that is what that is
technically

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
technically
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
trying not to be as technical as as it
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
is um that is essentially what it is
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
which it which basically um goes over to
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
the uh recommendation of the program but
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
there is a significant policy role in
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
determining how to approach it what to
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
take and um flexibility perhaps um by
 
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
the very people who are tasked with
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
doing that job is allow you to allows
 
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
them to do that job so my follow-up
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
question would be is it an
 
00:44:35.549 --> 00:44:35.559 align:start position:0%
oversimplification to say that the time
 
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
frames used to calculate net present
 
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
value is the big issue
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
here I would generally agree with that
 
00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
statement it would be oversimplified if
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
we get to that conclusion um however
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
having recognized that I would say that
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
what is required is essentially some
 
00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
sort of a policy guidance that is
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
enabled through the statutes that gives
 
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:05.720 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to the authority who are
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
tasked with doing that or performing
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
that job
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
um that's that would be it good thank
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
um representative muns has a question
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for uh
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um from your
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
testimony it it appears that um the the
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
granite state test is basically a flawed
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
methodology there are a lot of problems
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
with it um you know the fact that if I
 
00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:45.319 align:start position:0%
understood you correctly that they're
 
00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
using two different discount rates one
 
00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:50.559 align:start position:0%
for benefits and one for costs I mean I
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
I understand that and that's that is a
 
00:45:55.549 --> 00:45:55.559 align:start position:0%
problem um my I guess my question for
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
you is is that methodology defined
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
somewhere in
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
statute um and um you know you know that
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere so I to to ju just jump in on
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
the question of whether or not you know
 
00:46:17.549 --> 00:46:17.559 align:start position:0%
the test itself is flawed there are no
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
tests that are going to be perfect and
 
00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
and there may or may be may may or may
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
not be you know issues or misalignments
 
00:46:28.589 --> 00:46:28.599 align:start position:0%
that Dr brief identified those are in
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
essence policy decisions in a lot of
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
ways and those choice of discount rates
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
are decisions that had been made uh at
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
some point along the line uh to to trade
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
some flaws for another so it's not to
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
say that the granite state test is is is
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
not the appropriate test and and before
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
this uh house spell 549 passed it was
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
the prevailing cost Effectiveness test
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh at the commission but it is to say
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
that nothing is nothing is perfect and
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
that you know as as referenced by both
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
Dr AR and uh Mr Mr spidel um there there
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
probably needs to be greater flexibility
 
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
for the commission and this is the
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
Commission in
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
2026 uh to to be able to look uh at at
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
those adjustments um the second part of
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
the question I'm going to let Dr AR
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
address um thank you for that I I would
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
just simply add to other factors any
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
decision is taken at the time off with
 
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
the available information best available
 
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
information the test is not generally
 
00:47:43.549 --> 00:47:43.559 align:start position:0%
flawed what information is fed into it
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
and how is really the question and there
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
are policy implications of that um and
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
policy decisions are to be taken that is
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
what we are focusing on and just to
 
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
answer the part of the question that we
 
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
didn't touch on the granite state test
 
00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:03.079 align:start position:0%
is not defined in statute it is
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
referenced in in that statute um and it
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
it has been taken to mean the order that
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
approved it and then the uh working
 
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
group report and the um the the research
 
00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
and Analysis that went into the approval
 
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
of that 2019 uh order F
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
followup followup um so I I think I
 
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying but I
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
guess the the one question I have now is
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
that um you said it both of you said on
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
several occasions that um the test
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
reflects policy decisions that were made
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
well who made those policy
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
decisions uh well the the Commission in
 
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
in approving that order in 2019 and the
 
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
legislature in putting uh the granted
 
00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
state test in Statute in House Bill 549
 
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
and that's part of why you know in my
 
00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
discussions with repres representative
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
Harrington to uh bring up this bill um
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
and as I referenced earlier those policy
 
00:49:04.589 --> 00:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
decisions were not thoroughly discussed
 
00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh at the time of House Bill 549 going
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
through the legislature and being passed
 
00:49:11.069 --> 00:49:11.079 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a ton of public input there
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
wasn't a ton of legislative input and I
 
00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
think it's clear that that happened for
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
a reason uh to to you know uh stabilize
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
a situation but um we wanted to bring
 
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
this forward so the legisl
 
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
would both be aware and and be able to
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
consider uh these issues and whether or
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
not they want to be responsible for them
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
or let the Pu do what they're paid to do
 
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that representative
 
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
campan and representative Corman I would
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
like you both to remember the questions
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
you want to
 
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
ask I am going to recess this public
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
hearing until
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
11:00 that's approximately 12 minutes
 
00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
from now and the reason I'm doing that
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
is because I'm going to open a public
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
1078 relative to first responder
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
organization access to wireless tower
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
collocation I'm going to ask the prime
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Mark PR to
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
introduce this legislation to
 
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
US Representative PR sorry to keep you
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
waiting so
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
long thank you I appreciate you making
 
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
Provisions because I have somewhere else
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
to be I'd rather be here but I have to
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
be somewhere else so introducing uh
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and the members of
 
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:34.510 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and the members of
the

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:38.589 --> 00:50:38.599 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Mark PR
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
um from Hillsboro 15 which is Manchester
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
w 8 so I come bringing this bill to be
 
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
able to collocate first responder radio
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
equipment basically an antenna on a
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
tower along with the equipment that goes
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
with it um down
 
00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.069 align:start position:0%
with it um down
below

00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
below
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
um not being a 100% expert so I come
 
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
from I work for the town of eping as
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
their deputy chief uh we are having a
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
lot of radio communication issues out
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
there we're hoping to be able to revamp
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
our system at some point and as you know
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
out towards the Sea Coast there are not
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of Hills to stick an antenna on or
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
tall buildings so we're going to need
 
00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
multiple locations for our antennas so
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
this is what is really driving this
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill but I would imagine that a lot of
 
00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions would benefit from
 
00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
being able to have uh the ability to
 
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
collocate on towers that are already up
 
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.829 align:start position:0%
collocate on towers that are already up
and

00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
available uh originally I asked for the
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
top 20 feet but as talking to Department
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
of Safety which he'll be um is behind me
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll be
 
00:52:02.789 --> 00:52:02.799 align:start position:0%
um testifying that may not always be the
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
best spot for our antenna due to FCC
 
00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:08.799 align:start position:0%
regulations and such so maybe we're just
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
looking for the ability to C out K that
 
00:52:15.309 --> 00:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
in the spot that might be better suited
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
for us um and I'm okay with
 
00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
that uh we talked about priority and
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
that I have it as local city
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
County State
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
and he brought up a good point that I
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
didn't even think of that as a town
 
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
having the first priority or right of
 
00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:38.799 align:start position:0%
refusal they might say yeah we don't
 
00:52:40.789 --> 00:52:40.799 align:start position:0%
have anything right right away but that
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
might be great in 10 years and lock up
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
that space where the state could come in
 
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
and put a department of safety
 
00:52:50.829 --> 00:52:50.839 align:start position:0%
interoperability um radios that would
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
probably serve the area better better so
 
00:52:57.309 --> 00:52:57.319 align:start position:0%
maybe that can be negotiated that the
 
00:52:59.390 --> 00:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
priority goes to the local first but if
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
they don't have a plan they can't lock
 
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
it up and and it the Statewide
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
interoperability committee should be
 
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
looking at that and making that
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
decision and he also brought up that you
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
know maybe they'll be charged
 
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
for collocating but I look at it and I
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
know some other towns already have it in
 
00:53:23.549 --> 00:53:23.559 align:start position:0%
their Charters
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
um or what have you
 
00:53:28.829 --> 00:53:28.839 align:start position:0%
that it's the cost of doing business and
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
we get to locate one antenna or whatever
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
up there as a cost of doing business and
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
with that I'll end my my testimony
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
because I know you got a lot of left on
 
00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
that other bill and I'll take a couple
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
of quick questions I guess okay thank
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
you representative PR questions for
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
representative PR Vice chair
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I I I happen to
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
ask my own fire department in lary about
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
this bill and they they were in favor of
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
it uh because their rationale was it
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
would really help with their
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
negotiations when they try and locate
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
first responder equipment um on any any
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
new new tower in in your case is it just
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
a matter of help negotiations or is this
 
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
more of a matter of uh you have some
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
critical dead spots that you can't get
 
00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
to because of lack of this type of a
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
bill we have more dead spots than a
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
cemetery so
 
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
um we really need to be able to spread
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
our antennas out to cover those spots
 
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
and and I know trying to put up a tower
 
00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:40.839 align:start position:0%
takes a while so if there's one already
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
there that will work for us I think that
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
would be great I know I had some other
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
fire chiefs that were going to come but
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
because it's snowing and they have to
 
00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:51.799 align:start position:0%
stay in town so when the school bus
 
00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:56.200 align:start position:0%
rolls over or whatever they're there
 
00:54:58.589 --> 00:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
well I know there are 39 cemeteries in
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
eing so that's a lot of dead spots yes
 
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
yes there is further questions
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
representative liwicki has one uh thank
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
question um who owns these towers and if
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
um we are to essentially take of you
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
know demand that a private owner on a
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
private property uh give up some
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
worthwhile space on their thing on their
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
towel would this not be a
 
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.390 align:start position:0%
towel would this not be a
taking

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
I guess but um I know especially if
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
they're putting up a tower that uh this
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
might help the town say if you want a
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
town it a tower in our town you have to
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
give us a
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
space further questions representative
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative Pro for taking my
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
question and for being here today um I
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
just took a quick glance at what was
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
written out in terms of um testimony on
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
the bill and I note that we have uh uh
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs and safety weighing
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
in on the practicality of implementing
 
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:05.039 align:start position:0%
the bill as written they're basically
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
talking about legal issues um and
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
practical issues in terms of there's a
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
problem you want to solve and this is
 
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
the vehicle you're giving us to solve it
 
00:56:16.029 --> 00:56:16.039 align:start position:0%
have you had any conversations with them
 
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
around how practical it is to use this
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
particular solution to get to the ends
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
that you're seeking so I've had some I
 
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
just spoke with the Department of Safety
 
00:56:27.069 --> 00:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
out in the hall uh nobody's really
 
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
reached out to me beforehand so and and
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
I understand I don't know enough about
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
all of this and that's where the
 
00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:36.839 align:start position:0%
committee comes in I know in my
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
committees we're we're doing some of
 
00:56:40.109 --> 00:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
this work on some of the other bills
 
00:56:41.789 --> 00:56:41.799 align:start position:0%
that people don't really have all the
 
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
background that they need so I'm open to
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely trying to fix this to make at
 
00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
work as best we
 
00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
can thank
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
you and additional questions sorry about
 
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
the mic
 
00:57:02.829 --> 00:57:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
partiall thank you chair and thank you
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
for your uh testimony today um can you
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
tell me we are talking about Wireless
 
00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
and Broadband uh access for emergency
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
services Noble idea um how redundant is
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
the W would the wireless service be
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
generally speaking I know every
 
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
situation is different but how redundant
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
would it be to what's already there
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
available in Broadband which I also
 
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
understand is not always Dependable can
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
you speak to that so we're not always
 
00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
using broadband and stuff we're using
 
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
land mobile radio uh I know in our fire
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
World those radios are more rugged than
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
anything else and running into burning
 
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.069 align:start position:0%
anything else and running into burning
buildings

00:57:50.069 --> 00:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
with less sturdy equipment doesn't
 
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
usually work and yes I know some of our
 
00:57:59.230 --> 00:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
radios have that ability to use
 
00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:01.799 align:start position:0%
broadband and
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
stuff but they're like at four times the
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
cost of a regular
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
radio followup followup I just one this
 
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:14.039 align:start position:0%
so I understand now we're talking about
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh where the First Responders is the
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
point of access we're actually doing the
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
service not uh the first responder
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
Network correct okay thank you for
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
clarifying that
 
00:58:29.069 --> 00:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you uh I'm over here um
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't I don't get to see you guys
 
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
very much but um my question is to the
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
best of your ability or to the best of
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
your knowledge have any First
 
00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
Responders organizations been denied
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
space on a a wire or been denied space
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
or the request for an
 
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
antenna I have not heard
 
00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
that but
 
00:59:03.029 --> 00:59:03.039 align:start position:0%
um not
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
personally I've had heard it in general
 
00:59:09.789 --> 00:59:09.799 align:start position:0%
that they asked didn't get on what have
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
you I have heard like uh it's either
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
East Kingston or Kensington has it in
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
their Town Charter or whatever they used
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh to have that
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
ability to have a spot on the
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
tower uh it was East Kingston cuz the
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
Chief came to me and said I forgot to
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
ask for a top portion of the
 
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
Tower and I'm down at like 20 feet off
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
the ground which really didn't help me
 
00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:45.160 align:start position:0%
at all whereas if I had it 60 feet
 
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
probably would have been better yeah
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay I'm going to suggest
 
00:59:53.789 --> 00:59:53.799 align:start position:0%
that we hold our further questions for
 
00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
the people who will testify after
 
00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
representative PR representative PR
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
needs to be over at the fire academy so
 
01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
we want to thank you for introducing
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and uh we own it now so we'll
 
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
we'll take it from here thank you thank
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
you for the uh help you bet okay so I'm
 
01:00:16.109 --> 01:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
going to recess this public hearing
 
01:00:16.119 --> 01:00:17.510 align:start position:0%
going to recess this public hearing
until

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
until
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
11:15 and I'm going to resume the public
 
01:00:23.069 --> 01:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
hearing on the previous bill which is
 
01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1036
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
we have one more person who wants to
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
testify on this
 
01:00:32.109 --> 01:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
bill and I will bring back the
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy if there are
 
01:00:35.789 --> 01:00:35.799 align:start position:0%
questions for those individuals but
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
first let's hear from Mike lcot of
 
01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
eversource to get his perspective on
 
01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
eversource to get his perspective on
this

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.789 align:start position:0%
 
legislation

01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the record Michael Lata
 
01:01:00.029 --> 01:01:00.039 align:start position:0%
representing eversource also think it's
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
important probably to point out I am not
 
01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:05.240 align:start position:0%
an economist just when we get to the Q&amp;A
 
01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
section um eversource is opposed to the
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
the legislation as introduced uh we do
 
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
support keeping the current cost benefit
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
test in statute um for use in future
 
01:01:19.029 --> 01:01:19.039 align:start position:0%
proceedings uh I think is important to
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
note that the granite state test was uh
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
developed by a broad set of stakeholders
 
01:01:28.029 --> 01:01:28.039 align:start position:0%
in 2018 and 2019 that included the
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
utilities included the consumer Advocate
 
01:01:33.309 --> 01:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
um included at the time Public Utilities
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
Commission staff uh as well as numerous
 
01:01:38.109 --> 01:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders uh involved in the
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency uh dockets uh that was
 
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
approved by commission order in
 
01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
2019 um those orders do have the the
 
01:01:50.109 --> 01:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
effect of Law and so that has been the
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
test that has been in use since uh I
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
know it was discussed the legislative of
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
history of codifying the granite state
 
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
test and the current uh cost benefit
 
01:02:02.029 --> 01:02:02.039 align:start position:0%
test uh so I won't cover that but I I
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
did want to speak to the benefits of
 
01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
keeping um the cost benefit the existing
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
cost benefit test uh in statute which is
 
01:02:12.269 --> 01:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
uh I know this Committee in the past
 
01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
when uh reviewing House Bill 549 heard a
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
lot from uh uh contractors private
 
01:02:22.269 --> 01:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
business about the the necessity for
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
consistency uh in the programming and so
 
01:02:28.269 --> 01:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
uh for the utilities having this cost
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
benefit uh codified into the statute
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
provides us with
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
consistency uh we have a knowledge of
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
what programs will qualify what programs
 
01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
will not uh where to put resources in
 
01:02:44.029 --> 01:02:44.039 align:start position:0%
terms of of additional funding that
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
consistency allows us to um uh structure
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
programs when we're filing for submitt
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
to the commission um our three-year
 
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
trienal plan as was referenced we we
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
just got approval of the most recent uh
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
plan uh without that uh consistency
 
01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
there is uncertainty uncertainty around
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
what programs will qualify um whether
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
the a commission could um sort of take a
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
sharp left or a sharp right turn uh
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
after a planed submitt which would
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
require uh significant revisions to a
 
01:03:23.069 --> 01:03:23.079 align:start position:0%
plan the uh contractor Community are
 
01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
customers who rely on these programs
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
businesses that rely on these programs
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
vendors that build up their businesses
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
around providing these Services um that
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
inconsistency uh about a different cost
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
benefit test or radical changes to to
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit test uh impacts them
 
01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
and so uh for those reasons we support
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
uh keeping the existing uh uh statutory
 
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
language and uh would encourage the
 
01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh not to move forward with
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
the bill as as introduced happy to
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you to the
 
01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
best of my ability
 
01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
Mr we'll try not to put you on the spot
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
too much question wise
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
but the first question that occurs to me
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
is that this bill doesn't remove the
 
01:04:14.829 --> 01:04:14.839 align:start position:0%
granite state test or any other test
 
01:04:14.839 --> 01:04:16.470 align:start position:0%
granite state test or any other test
from

01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:04:20.029 --> 01:04:20.039 align:start position:0%
statute and the issue seems to me to be
 
01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:23.799 align:start position:0%
the inputs that are being used by these
 
01:04:23.799 --> 01:04:25.710 align:start position:0%
the inputs that are being used by these
tests

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
tests
 
01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
to do the cost benefit analysis that
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
they purport to do if the inputs are
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
inconsistent then can you agree that
 
01:04:39.789 --> 01:04:39.799 align:start position:0%
maybe some modifications need to be made
 
01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
so that we can be relatively certain
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
that the cost benefit analysis is an
 
01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
accurate one uh
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
so want to make sure I'm staying in in
 
01:04:55.269 --> 01:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
my non-economist Lane um um so so you
 
01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
are correct it it does not strike the
 
01:04:59.390 --> 01:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
the grant at state test or the current
 
01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
cost benefit test from the statue but
 
01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
what it does say is that uh the
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
commission is not required to use those
 
01:05:10.349 --> 01:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
on a going forward basis so um you know
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to acknowledge
 
01:05:15.789 --> 01:05:15.799 align:start position:0%
sort of the regulatory backdrop that
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
this uh legislation is being offered uh
 
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
which is you know the last triennial
 
01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
plan um the commission uh I would say in
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
their their data requests in their order
 
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh voiced skepticism voiced a level of
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
of desire to make we'll say significant
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
changes to the cost benefit test um and
 
01:05:44.349 --> 01:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
so that is is sort of the backdrop the
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
lens by which we are uh the utility uh
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
that eversource excuse me is reviewing
 
01:05:53.789 --> 01:05:53.799 align:start position:0%
this language through um so you know if
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
you think about the granted state test
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
as as a a framework a cost benefit
 
01:05:59.950 --> 01:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
framework and here's where I don't want
 
01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
to get uh provide an accurate
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
information or or um you know misspeak
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh but certainly when we're structuring
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
the programs you know I I think
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
inputs uh to that framework are subject
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
to change are subject to evaluation so
 
01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
um what is in in the statute uh does
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
point back to the commission order which
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
uh you know to representative M's
 
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
question you know where did this come
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
from points back to um the the product
 
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
of that working group in 2019 2018 and
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
so certainly is it possible to to review
 
01:06:42.109 --> 01:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
you know the inputs to that overall
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
framework um you know I I believe that
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
is is possible I think it is I would
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
want to touch based with our subject
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
matter experts though to to give you a
 
01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:51.750 align:start position:0%
matter experts though to to give you a
better

01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
answer further questions
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas has a question thank
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
01:07:01.269 --> 01:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
question so I understand that any
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
business likes
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
consistency whether or not a policy is
 
01:07:08.589 --> 01:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
good or bad whatever it is they like
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
consistency so my question would be at
 
01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:15.799 align:start position:0%
what point do you feel
 
01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
that A change is needed um to keep up
 
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
with the times in order to avoid doing
 
01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:27.559 align:start position:0%
the same thing over and over again when
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
conditions have changed what would you
 
01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
recommend uh or would you just say keep
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
it forever that way yeah it's it's a
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
fair question so I think first and
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
foremost um as expressed through the um
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
trianal plan we we are supportive of the
 
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
granite state test we we do think that
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
that is an appropriate test so uh you
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
know not just moving forward with a bad
 
01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
test because that's what we have to do
 
01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
um and you know I know the department
 
01:07:56.279 --> 01:07:57.549 align:start position:0%
um and you know I know the department
Express

01:07:57.549 --> 01:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
Express
 
01:07:59.950 --> 01:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
concerns as well although I I did hear
 
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
them say you know this is not a a
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
fundamentally flawed test so um so you
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
know I I think
 
01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
um if it is determined that there are
 
01:08:17.309 --> 01:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
issues with the test um then you know a
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
looking at how the granite state test
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
was developed to begin with which was a
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
rigorous lengthy stakeholder development
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
process um you know at some Future Point
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
uh could the
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
legislature direct the the you know
 
01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment a a similar stakeholder
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
process to to review and make
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
adjustments you know that might be
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate at a future date um I think
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
what we're suggesting is is now is not
 
01:08:46.759 --> 01:08:48.550 align:start position:0%
what we're suggesting is is now is not
that

01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
time followup thank you for the followup
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
so I I believe we her testimony that uh
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh um doe did not feel like the test was
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
actually flawed it was just the data
 
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
that was used in the formulas uh might
 
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
need to be looked at from time to time
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't you agree that there ought
 
01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
to be a mechanism in order to if you
 
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
want to keep the same test of course but
 
01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
to to update data that that is put into
 
01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
the formula how how would you how would
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
you go about keeping that data fresh and
 
01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:24.269 align:start position:0%
you go about keeping that data fresh and
updated

01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
updated
 
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
again I don't want to you know get past
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
my depth here so um you know I'd like uh
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
to touch Spas with the folks who are
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
involved in you know the data inputs um
 
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
how how they administer or apply I
 
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
should say the granite state test to to
 
01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
our um uh proposals on on you know
 
01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
whether they agree with I think there's
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
a fundamental question that there's
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
there's an issue there so I'd be Happ
 
01:09:57.310 --> 01:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
happy to provide an answer um back to to
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
you and the
 
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
committee representative Harrington has
 
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
you for point of order point of order Mr
 
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
chairman yes represent representative
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
Harrington introduced the bill and spoke
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
on the bill my understanding is that
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
when we speak on the bill we are not uh
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
to be asking questions you are correct
 
01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for addressing that point
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
of order I'll withdraw my recognition of
 
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
Representative Harrington representative
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
McGee has a question thank you Mr chair
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Lata for enduring us
 
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
one more time um I to my colleague's
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
point uh to the left um representative
 
01:10:38.669 --> 01:10:38.679 align:start position:0%
from londondary that there he was
 
01:10:41.229 --> 01:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
questioning a mechanism and what struck
 
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
me in the conversations that have been
 
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
had from that chair so far is that the
 
01:10:49.149 --> 01:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
process is what has actually changed
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
because the chair and myself were
 
01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
members of the easy board up until
 
01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:55.719 align:start position:0%
recently when it was dissolved and many
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
of these conversations around uh how we
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
were approaching the funding were taken
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
care of in that very robust and
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
long-term stakeholder group and so that
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
piece is not available anymore um and my
 
01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is that when subcommittees
 
01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
through the easy board actually worked
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
to bring something to the Public
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission in terms of a
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
trianal plan they also engaged an
 
01:11:24.189 --> 01:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
economist in order to substantiate the
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
inputs that they were providing so can
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
you speak to how much the process has
 
01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
changed since the utilities are now I
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
guess working together to try and come
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
up with that plan devoid of the
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
additional stakeholder process that used
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:43.629 --> 01:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
utilized so as you said representative
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question um uh
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
certainly there has been a change that
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
the easy board um as of last year was
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
was abolished and as you pointed out the
 
01:11:56.350 --> 01:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
easy board had
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
provided um the utilities with a A you
 
01:12:03.149 --> 01:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
know recognized venue for stakeholder
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
input uh as you said there were
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
different subcommittees of the easy
 
01:12:10.629 --> 01:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
board that were uh put into place to you
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
know look at funding mechanisms look at
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
at cost benefit tests um on a going
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
forward basis and and those were used uh
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
as part of the last triennial plan um so
 
01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
on a going forward basis um uh you know
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
when we're putting together our next
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
trienal plan in in two years um you know
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
we will have to find a a replacement a
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
substitute for um that public
 
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholder uh inputs that the easy
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
board had provided and certainly you
 
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.229 align:start position:0%
board had provided and certainly you
know

01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
it's I would would say a known universe
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
of of interested parties uh subject to
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
expansion and other input
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
but I think it would be uh probably more
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
on a an ad hoc basis of bringing the
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
utilities as we start developing these
 
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
plans bringing in stakeholders and
 
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
having very similar conversations and
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
discussions just outside of that um
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
established easy board
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
framework followup so my follow-up
 
01:13:17.629 --> 01:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
question would be it sounds like where
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
we're having a bit of a breakdown is in
 
01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
whose assumptions we're using as our
 
01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:23.870 align:start position:0%
whose assumptions we're using as our
inputs

01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
inputs
 
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
and that there are assumptions being
 
01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
thrown around in terms of the plan not
 
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
being right and discussions around how
 
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
do we get to the correct assumptions so
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
can you give us in your testimony here
 
01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
today um eversource's position in terms
 
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
of how we make those
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
determinations um do do you have an
 
01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
economist on staff who's working on this
 
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
type of thing in order to give a
 
01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
qualified opinion on when an assumption
 
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
is being made whether it's accurate in
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
order to get to a cost benefit or um you
 
01:13:57.070 --> 01:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
know some of the testimony that we heard
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
earlier about perhaps they're not being
 
01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:00.679 align:start position:0%
the best inputs where are the inputs
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
coming from yeah I I I think the the
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
best approach and again thank you for
 
01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
the question is um I I would be happy to
 
01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
um knowing that this is the public
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
hearing but have our our Energy
 
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
Efficiency staff that puts together um
 
01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
the triennial plans we can provide sort
 
01:14:20.629 --> 01:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
of a an explainer like a onepage of how
 
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
they go about doing that uh selecting
 
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
program funding how the cost benefit
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
tests are are applied and and the
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
Assumption so I think that would
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
probably be the the best approach is I
 
01:14:32.629 --> 01:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
would be happy to follow up with that
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
and provide it to to the
 
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
committee thank you but there is rigor
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
thank you there is rigor to your point
 
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
yes all right
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh you seem to focus on consistency and
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
I just wondered is would it be fair to
 
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
say that you have a concern that the Pu
 
01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
adequately um I think it is fair to say
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
that uh the having the cost benefit test
 
01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
in statute provides consistency uh on a
 
01:15:23.229 --> 01:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
going forward basis and removing the re
 
01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
requirement to use that any commission
 
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
um it is subject subject to change and
 
01:15:34.189 --> 01:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
so that inserts an amount of uncertainty
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
into the process going forward I think
 
01:15:36.159 --> 01:15:37.510 align:start position:0%
into the process going forward I think
that's

01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
fair follow
 
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
up yeah but I I I mean I wonder if you
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
would you know concede that if the Pu
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
does value
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
consistency that any changes they make
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
you know they will you know that will be
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:54.990 align:start position:0%
part of the
consideration

01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
I I I would agree that if a uh
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
commission excuse me commission values
 
01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
consistency then they would uh to use
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
use the phrase you know use a light
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
touch with changes acknowledging that uh
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
radical changes would would have
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
negative impacts although you know we
 
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
have seen past orders where there have
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
been radical changes that they uh had uh
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
suggested and then or adopted by order
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
and then the the legislature had sort of
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
stepped in with Senate uh House Bill 549
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
realigned okay representative Thomas has
 
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
a question um actually I think I it's a
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
question for the doe so are you going to
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
call them back up thank
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh Mr Lata I'd like
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
to reflect on the fact that
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
representative Corman and representative
 
01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
Kaplan have further questions for the do
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
doe so I'd like the doe to uh return to
 
01:17:00.189 --> 01:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
the table if you would please we do have
 
01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
one more person who wants to testify
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
after the doe and then we need to resume
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
on HB
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
1078 so uh thank you to commissioner
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
Elms and Mr Arif for returning to the
 
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
podium here I have a quick question and
 
01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.629 align:start position:0%
podium here I have a quick question and
that

01:17:24.629 --> 01:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
is can the Pu change inputs we've
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier that inputs seem to be
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
to these tests seem to be an issue can
 
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
they change those now so I don't want to
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
speak for the Public Utilities
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
Commission because uh Mr spidel left um
 
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
the way that that the majority of the uh
 
01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
Commission in in their recent order
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
interpreted the statute uh they could
 
01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
not make any changes to the cost
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness test so
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
that Al that fact alone regardless of
 
01:17:58.590 --> 01:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not stakeholders uh or
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
interveners believe that they could
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
change inputs it shows that there is at
 
01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:05.800 align:start position:0%
the very least a lack of legislative
 
01:18:08.189 --> 01:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
Clarity on whether or what the pu's
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
authority is as it comes as it pertains
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
to cost Effectiveness tests I do also
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
just want to um apologize I did cut off
 
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh Dr AR earlier for for you know in his
 
01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
testimony I I don't think we would
 
01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to say that the only
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
potential issue or uh area of of
 
01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
discussion here is the input I think
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
there was a you know OB uh he talked
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
about an asymmetry um in the benefit
 
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
cost ratio there are other
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
considerations that go into uh you know
 
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
determining these things and and frankly
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit why this bill is
 
01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:44.910 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit why this bill is
coming

01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
forward you know I I cut uh Dr AR off
 
01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
because you know he he had I think
 
01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
another five or six pages of testimony
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
to get through uh we we we could talk
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
all day about these issues and and as uh
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
Mr lcot indicated there was a lot of
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
work that went into the development of
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
the grand state test future iterations
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
changes anything like that under this
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
statute are going to have to happen
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
through the legislature and so if the
 
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to take on that
 
01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility um just just know that
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
there there is a a great deal of
 
01:19:19.149 --> 01:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
discussion uh that should happen um as
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
these as these plant move forward um and
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
and it's to
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
you is Mr AR's testimony available to
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
the committee uh we can make it make it
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
available great that would be
 
01:19:31.679 --> 01:19:33.510 align:start position:0%
available great that would be
wonderful

01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:35.030 align:start position:0%
wonderful
representative

01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
um Corman has a question for you
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
actually thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh Mr Arif um
 
01:19:44.189 --> 01:19:44.199 align:start position:0%
your your
 
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
testimony scared me a little bit uh in
 
01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
that you're you're saying that no test
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
is perfect and I certainly understand
 
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of assumptions
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
being made in a test and when even a
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
discount rate is really a guess as to
 
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in the
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
future so I'm a little concerned that
 
01:20:05.709 --> 01:20:05.719 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps we get a situation
 
01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
where we do a cost benefit test and it
 
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
comes out
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
1.02 or
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
998 and we make it a decision on that
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
it's greater than one it's less than one
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
but actually there's a margin of error
 
01:20:21.070 --> 01:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
here should these tests include a margin
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
possible thank you for the question
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative Corman um I apologize my
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
testimony was not or never meant to be
 
01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:37.719 align:start position:0%
concerning or uh daunting but uh it it
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh if I may speak for just myself not
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily doe just as a granite stator
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
myself it did scare me when the
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
commission said that they could only
 
01:20:51.070 --> 01:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
opine on 3% of a quarter of a billion
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
dollar which turns out out to be just
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
about merely like you know if my memory
 
01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
supports me 200 out of $253
 
01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.470 align:start position:0%
supports me 200 out of $253
million

01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
$246 million they were silent on it the
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
majority of the commission order was and
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
there got to be a reason why they were
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
and that is probably under the
 
01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
microscope here rather than like you
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
know there are nuances to answer your
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
question specifically all tests have
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
margins of errors and they that is by a
 
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
um definition it the construction of
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
these tests takes into account of those
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
and those are rigorous in a enough uh
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
themselves um so yes but those margins
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
of errors in a way speak to the policy
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
scope and to what
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
degree uh The Authority or the system
 
01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
put in place um and the stakeholders
 
01:21:52.669 --> 01:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
interpret those margins of error is
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
really the question under the microscope
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
over here um as Deputy Commissioner Elms
 
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
was saying to uh essentially the the
 
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
most recent order from the
 
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
Pu um looking into the proposal that was
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
put before them appears to have been
 
01:22:17.669 --> 01:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
very uncomfortable in opining on the 97%
 
01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
of the overall budget um the question is
 
01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:23.229 align:start position:0%
of the overall budget um the question is
why

01:22:23.229 --> 01:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
and uh whether the enabling statutes
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
allows them and all the stakeholders
 
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
Frankly Speaking um to voice their
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
concern and on the aggregate make an
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
informed decision that is in the benefit
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
of the Granite Staters is really the
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
question follow up thank you all right
 
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
so you you said that the the uh margin
 
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
of error is is already taken into
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
account in the test yet the result of
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
the test is a number if I'm not mistaken
 
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
right it is a ratio it's not a ratio
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
with a plus or minus or anything like
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
that so how how do you take the margin
 
01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
of error into account and still come up
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
number that's an excellent question I
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
would acknowledge that having said so
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
though what we are really driving
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
to is the set of assumptions and the
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
margin of error around those assumptions
 
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
and whether they're acceptable or not is
 
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
the question having accepted all those
 
01:23:37.149 --> 01:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
premises we can always come up with a a
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
number and I do agree with you what what
 
01:23:45.149 --> 01:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
I if my memory again supports me the the
 
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
communication line was that the benefit
 
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
cost ratio last time around spits out
 
01:23:54.189 --> 01:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
2.11 meaning that every dollar spent in
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
terms of cost gives a
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
$211 in terms of benefits if the
 
01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
underlying assumptions are not correct
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
and the the ri rigor is missing in
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
coming up with that particular figure
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
the whole output or outcome
 
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
is um less than accurate and that's all
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
I wanted to capture by trying to provide
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
specific areas where uh all these
 
01:24:31.229 --> 01:24:31.239 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in their own admission
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
provided those responses and we wanted
 
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
to just bring it over to your attention
 
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
for your
 
01:24:40.109 --> 01:24:40.119 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you to
 
01:24:43.229 --> 01:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
gentleman for taking my question um
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner Elms you you you seem to be
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
throwing the ball into the legislature's
 
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
court by saying
 
01:24:54.149 --> 01:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
that you know this is something that we
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
can choose to take on or not choose to
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
take on and then that you know there are
 
01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:58.590 align:start position:0%
take on and then that you know there are
very

01:24:58.590 --> 01:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
deep technical questions that we might
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
have or not have expertise on but given
 
01:25:06.109 --> 01:25:06.119 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we're hearing and the
 
01:25:08.669 --> 01:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
uncertainty that seems to be implicit in
 
01:25:11.109 --> 01:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
the coste effectiveness process in
 
01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
general and the policy implications of
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
those uncertainties how can we not get
 
01:25:19.109 --> 01:25:19.119 align:start position:0%
involved and given that uh wouldn't you
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
agree that this might be more
 
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate for a study commission
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
a wholesale removal of the cost the cost
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
effective assessments process thank you
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
I I I really do appreciate that question
 
01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
and and I would I wouldn't characterize
 
01:25:35.629 --> 01:25:35.639 align:start position:0%
it as I'm throwing it into your court uh
 
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to tell you is this ball
 
01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
right now because of the statute is
 
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
fully in your court um it's it's there
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
and you took it on in House Bill
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
549 um you
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
know the reason and and I I'll just Echo
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
what I said in in House Bill 16 17's um
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
testimony the reason that every state
 
01:25:58.350 --> 01:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
has a Public Utilities Commission uh or
 
01:26:01.149 --> 01:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
a dpu or whatever you know they call it
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh is because these are very um complex
 
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
time consuming uh processes that involve
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
experts and stakeholders and a really
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
collaborative process a study commission
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know there there does need to be a
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
really deep look at what we're doing
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
essentially a pu is going to do that
 
01:26:21.390 --> 01:26:21.400 align:start position:0%
work of the study commission that's why
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
we have a pu
 
01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
and I and I'll just say you know to to
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
whatever discomfort folks have with the
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
current makeup of of the executive
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
branch energy apparatus right uh the
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
chairman of the Pu his term is up in
 
01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
July of 2025 the commissioner of
 
01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
Energy's term is up in December of 2025
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
and the Deputy Commissioner is up in
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
August of 2025 a new governor is going
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
to make all of those appointments um
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
this legislature could look very
 
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
different the reason this isn't really
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
about any individual people or left or
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
right or whoever's you know in charge
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's frankly what is the appropriate
 
01:26:59.229 --> 01:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
statutory framework uh that that we want
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
to apply the legislature right now has
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
made a decision it is the
 
01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
legislator if if we think that this is a
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
job that might be more appropriate for
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission I would
 
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
suggest moving forward with this bill or
 
01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
it representative Thomas has a
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um I think
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
you may have answered answered my
 
01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
question but I just want to clarify so
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
you said that if we if the legislature
 
01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
wants to make or if the state of New
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wants to make any changes to
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
the granite state test it has to be done
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
through the legislature is that
 
01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
correct I I think I would be fair to say
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
that that is the interpretation of a
 
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
majority of the Public Utilities
 
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639 align:start position:0%
Commission follow
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
up yes go ahead so there's no team that
 
01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
owns this is this is blowing my mind
 
01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
there's no team te that owns this test
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
that can update it as needed on a
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
regular basis it has to come before the
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
legislature for every single update to
 
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
this test that's
 
01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
crazy that is the interpretation that
 
01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
that led to us bringing forward a bill
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
that would say that the legislature
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
might want to bring in more flexibility
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
so I I would agree with you yeah okay
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you uh for
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
being here and for your test
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that strikes me
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
about what I'm hearing you saying uh
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
from from the the hearing
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
table uh is that the concern is that uh
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
the most significant portion of the
 
01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
money that's put aside for Energy
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
Efficiency into the New Hampshire saves
 
01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
program is not something that the Pu has
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to question or modify
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I I I guess my take would be that
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature has kind of spoken on
 
01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that we want Energy Efficiency
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
we want the New Hampshire saves program
 
01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:07.400 align:start position:0%
to have that funding and to make those
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
changes because um regardless of how
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
that uh how the testing results in a
 
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
number uh which may have variables to it
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
um we do have sufficient evidence that
 
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
there is a significant benefit to
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
creating the negawatts that the consumer
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
Advocate tells us about all the time
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
right the energy that we don't use is a
 
01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
savings it's a saving across the system
 
01:29:38.229 --> 01:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
and so I think there's a there may be a
 
01:29:41.229 --> 01:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
disconnect between us as to what we are
 
01:29:43.229 --> 01:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve whether we are trying
 
01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
to uh get at that money in order to say
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
it should be less or we need to save it
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
or we don't want to charge people that
 
01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
or whether we see that
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
that is sort of the one and only way
 
01:29:56.350 --> 01:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
that we've agreed that we would like to
 
01:29:58.709 --> 01:29:58.719 align:start position:0%
have a benefit across the system for
 
01:30:00.910 --> 01:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
everybody and it's a great point and
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's one I agree with and and I think
 
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:06.280 align:start position:0%
what what is very clear in in statute is
 
01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
that costeffective Energy Efficiency is
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
a policy of the State of New Hampshire
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
but the cost effective is an important
 
01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
part of it we don't do Energy Efficiency
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
for energy efficiency's sake and so the
 
01:30:17.950 --> 01:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
question would be and I'm not saying
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
this in the context that the GST is this
 
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
but if our cost Effectiveness test
 
01:30:26.350 --> 01:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
becomes flawed or has flaws in inputs
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
that are unable to be changed it just
 
01:30:30.189 --> 01:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
calls into question that first part the
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
cost effective part of cost effective
 
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency so we agree with you
 
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
this is about Energy Efficiency and and
 
01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
and getting it done the right way it's
 
01:30:41.109 --> 01:30:41.119 align:start position:0%
just making sure that we have the
 
01:30:43.109 --> 01:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
flexibility to ensure that those
 
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
programs that we're undertaking are
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
costeffective and again the granite
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
state test might be there but if if if
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
there Comes A Time 2026 and Beyond where
 
01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:55.400 align:start position:0%
where we don't see that it's now very
 
01:30:57.229 --> 01:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
inflexible and we don't have the ability
 
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
legislature have a followup followup and
 
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that answer I think that's
 
01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
um makes perfect sense the thing that I
 
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
question the bill about though is
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
whether we eliminate the tools that we
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
have before we have figured out what the
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
tools are that we should be going to
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
because what it does is it not only
 
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
gives flexibility it gives far too much
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
leeway without any uh of the
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
legislator's input in terms of what
 
01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
would be a relevant cost test let's
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
avoid the temptation to ask the same
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
question in a different way I I I would
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
just say on that point um this would go
 
01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
back to the statutory framework that
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
existed before March of
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
2022 um you know I and and frankly uh
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
what house bill 549 was in reaction to a
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
perceived um abrupt change in a negative
 
01:31:56.109 --> 01:31:56.119 align:start position:0%
way for the legislature stakeholders the
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
governor whoever and should a commission
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
not use the the appropriate
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
considerations that remains within the
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
purview of the legislature to come in
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
and and fix it again right I I would
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
hope that folks saw what happened with
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill 549 and would use that to
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
help guide you know future decision
 
01:32:18.270 --> 01:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
making thank you representative muns do
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
you have a new question to ask I I I
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
think think
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
so we'll see uh thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:32:28.189 --> 01:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
I want to I want to just follow up on
 
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
the um uh the back and forth you had
 
01:32:34.990 --> 01:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
with u representative Wendy Thomas
 
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
um um if if if any of the parameters of
 
01:32:44.189 --> 01:32:44.199 align:start position:0%
the granite state test or the Total
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
Resource test or any of these other
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
tests uh if it's your view or and the
 
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
pu's view that
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
that can only be changed by
 
01:32:56.910 --> 01:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
legislation or by the
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
legislature should part of this bill
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
then be some kind of enabling power to
 
01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
the Pu to be able to
 
01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
change to to change the model as needed
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
to reflect things like changes in
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
inflation rate and discount rate I mean
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
should we be should we be giving you the
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
authority that it sounds like you want
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to kind of make some changes
 
01:33:25.229 --> 01:33:25.239 align:start position:0%
to a model that you know seems to be
 
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
working it's just that some of the the
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
the inputs are not
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
correct yeah yeah you you could you
 
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
could uh add language to further clarify
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
that changes could be made to the
 
01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
granite state test but and I I think it
 
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
might be the view of some that the
 
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
granite state test is the collection of
 
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
of of its you know component parts right
 
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
and that by being able to if if the law
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
just said you have to have something
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
called called the granite state test but
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
the Pu can change the P the the granite
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
state test to whatever they want it to
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
be in essence that's the same as
 
01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
removing the bill but if you I I guess
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
to your point maybe it's more about
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
specifying specifically what can be
 
01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
changed or what can be amended that's
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
something you could do frankly it it
 
01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
might just be you know easier to let the
 
01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:14.360 align:start position:0%
commission do what the commission's
 
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
meant to do followup okay so yeah I mean
 
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
I think I I hear what you're saying that
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know the test includes a whole a
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of different things but um I
 
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
mean yeah maybe we can limit it by
 
01:34:30.109 --> 01:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
saying you know you have the authority
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
you know you have to still do the basic
 
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
basic modeling that's being done now but
 
01:34:39.149 --> 01:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of specific things
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
like um do you use inflation adjusted
 
01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
you know costs or not um and what
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
inflation rate do you use and what
 
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
discount discount rate do you use and
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
you have the authority to change that I
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
mean some something like that sure and
 
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
and and if you'll indulge me a little
 
01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
bit on it I think we would be okay with
 
01:35:00.189 --> 01:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're just happy to have
 
01:35:02.109 --> 01:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
brought this bill forward so that you
 
01:35:03.629 --> 01:35:03.639 align:start position:0%
know that you have this discussion you
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
can have the conversation we would be
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
happy to participate in whatever
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
development of language this commission
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
or excuse me committee wants us to do
 
01:35:14.669 --> 01:35:14.679 align:start position:0%
you know we're I think we're clear on
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
where we stand on the on the bill I
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
think as written it's it gets the job
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
done uh but if you do have any desire to
 
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
further work on language we'd be happy
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
to weigh in on that okay we can't can't
 
01:35:31.950 --> 01:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
come up with a new bill during a public
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
hearing uh it's an important discussion
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
to have and I'm sure the committee
 
01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
during a work session will have a
 
01:35:41.229 --> 01:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
further discussion on what to do but we
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here to give us
 
01:35:44.669 --> 01:35:44.679 align:start position:0%
your perspective and for bringing this
 
01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:46.679 align:start position:0%
issue to our
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
attention so with that I'm going to ask
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Don Cree to come forward to to give
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
us his perspective on this legislation
 
01:35:57.390 --> 01:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
and Mr Cree I'd ask you to be sensitive
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
to the fact that we're under some severe
 
01:36:02.350 --> 01:36:02.360 align:start position:0%
time constraints here this morning we've
 
01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
already recessed one public hearing and
 
01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
we need to reopen that uh so please if
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
you could just confine your remarks
 
01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
to the most important nugget of what you
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
want us to know we'd appreciate that uh
 
01:36:21.870 --> 01:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record I'm
 
01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
Don Cree the consumer Advocate you all
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
know me you didn't have to tell me that
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I could tell what you were
 
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
thinking from the expression on your
 
01:36:34.030 --> 01:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
face uh I uh regret to say that I oppose
 
01:36:38.189 --> 01:36:38.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1036 and urge you to itl this
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill uh this is a pretty straightforward
 
01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
scenario uh in its order of November
 
01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:45.830 align:start position:0%
scenario uh in its order of November
12th

01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
12th
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
20121 the commission ridiculed and I
 
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
think that's a fair assessment the
 
01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
commission ridiculed the granite state
 
01:36:56.590 --> 01:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
test and said it had no intention of
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
applying it or considering it ever again
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
then when you adopted House Bill 549 you
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
overruled the commission and said no you
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
must use the granite state test it was
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
after all the product of a very long
 
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
arduous and thoughtful process uh that
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
was conducted by the benefit cost
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
working group which by the way operated
 
01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
not under the egis of the easy board but
 
01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
under the egis of the Public Utilities
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
Commission itself and I think it's
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
important to bear that in mind
 
01:37:30.189 --> 01:37:30.199 align:start position:0%
um there has been I think some
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings proliferating at this
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
hearing about what the quote unquote
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
inputs to the granite state test really
 
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
are and I think it is important to
 
01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
reread the pu's most recent order which
 
01:37:47.709 --> 01:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
went down on a two to one basis the
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
majority of the puc made absolutely
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
clear to you that if you tell the Pu
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
that it is no longer required to use the
 
01:37:59.310 --> 01:37:59.320 align:start position:0%
granite state test it will dispense with
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
that test largely for the same reasons
 
01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
that it gave in 2021 all of this talk
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
about inputs to the granite state test
 
01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
is I think confusing or misleading in
 
01:38:13.589 --> 01:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
the following sense what underlies the
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
granite state test is a thousand page
 
01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
document called the technical reference
 
01:38:20.589 --> 01:38:20.599 align:start position:0%
manual and what that thousand-page
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
document does does which you can check
 
01:38:24.189 --> 01:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
out because it is on the website of the
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
puc under docket
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
2092 is it goes through measure by
 
01:38:32.910 --> 01:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
measure by measure exactly what each of
 
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
those measures is capable of achieving
 
01:38:38.669 --> 01:38:38.679 align:start position:0%
by way of savings that's that is the
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
input that is the critical one for the
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
granite state test that does change from
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
time to time as circumstances meaning
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
technology economic conditions that sort
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
of thing change so the Pu is capable
 
01:38:57.589 --> 01:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
of changing its analysis about how to
 
01:39:00.030 --> 01:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
apply the granite state test based on
 
01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:01.350 align:start position:0%
apply the granite state test based on
changed

01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
conditions uh Dr Arif said well he was
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
concerned about the Pu only being able
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
to affect 3% of the hundreds of millions
 
01:39:13.709 --> 01:39:13.719 align:start position:0%
of dollars in uh rate payer funds that
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
go toward Energy Efficiency and I I
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
guess with all due respect to him as an
 
01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
attorney I I have to disagree I I don't
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
think the Pu the majority of the Pu was
 
01:39:27.229 --> 01:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
correct to reach that conclusion I know
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
that the only attorney on the Pu
 
01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
disagreed with that legal conclusion and
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
I disagree with it as
 
01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
well in my opinion excuse
 
01:39:41.589 --> 01:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
me the argument that the Pu is having
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
with the rest of the world about the
 
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
granite state test really comes down to
 
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
the discount rate that you apply in
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
order to take a benefit stream savings
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
that sometimes extends up to 30 years
 
01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
and bringing that up to a Net Present
 
01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
Value so it can reasonably and
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
responsibly be compared to costs and the
 
01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
granite state test calls for a low
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
social discount rate and the important
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
thing to remember about discount rates
 
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
is there really is no empirical data
 
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
that supports the choice of any discount
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
rate in my opinion to be perfectly
 
01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
straightforward with you I would say
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
that if you like rate payer funded
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency you apply a low
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
discount rate and if you think it's bad
 
01:40:28.990 --> 01:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
public policy then you apply a high
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
discount rate and the Public Utilities
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
Commission at least its majority has
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
made clear to you that it does not like
 
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
rate payer funded Energy Efficiency it
 
01:40:42.149 --> 01:40:42.159 align:start position:0%
is as simple as that all the talk about
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
inputs is I think uh misleading and is
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
something to think carefully about
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
before you legislate now you don't have
 
01:40:52.990 --> 01:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
to take my word for any of this and I
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
doubt you will I'm just trying to
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
introduce some doubt into the discourse
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
that you've heard from some of the uh
 
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
prior prior Witnesses um in light of the
 
01:41:06.589 --> 01:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
Chairman's uh suggestion that I be as
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
brief as possible I think I'll just
 
01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
leave it there and maybe there'll be a
 
01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
few questions thank you I do appreciate
 
01:41:16.109 --> 01:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
that your nugget seems to be that the
 
01:41:19.149 --> 01:41:19.159 align:start position:0%
real issue here is a low versus a high
 
01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
discount rate and that's something the
 
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
committee needs to give some serious
 
01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:26.360 align:start position:0%
thought to I I agree so further
 
01:41:28.910 --> 01:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative Corman thank
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you Mr Cree
 
01:41:32.910 --> 01:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I actually think
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
I want to ask you the same question I
 
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
asked Mr Arif uh given that there's
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
uncertainty and we apply these tests and
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
get a number rather than some sort of
 
01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:45.350 align:start position:0%
get a number rather than some sort of
reasonable

01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
range are these tests really that
 
01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
helpful if we're actually just going
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
going to use a number I'm actually not
 
01:41:57.070 --> 01:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
sure that I agree that there is as much
 
01:41:59.589 --> 01:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
uncertainty as you think there is I mean
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
you are looking at a future stream of
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
benefits and even though I have a
 
01:42:07.149 --> 01:42:07.159 align:start position:0%
crystal ball on my desk at the office
 
01:42:09.870 --> 01:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
even I can't AG uh predict the future
 
01:42:12.990 --> 01:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
with accuracy but I I I think most of
 
01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
the time the results are pretty
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
objectively verifiable because they all
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
are derived from that technical
 
01:42:21.070 --> 01:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
reference manual and I'd invite you is a
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
person who loves to crunch numbers to
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
take a look at that the other point I
 
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
would make about the way this works
 
01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
under house bill 549 is that when you
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
get to those measures that fall right on
 
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
the line right around either a little
 
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
above or a little below one the statute
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
says that there actually is a secondary
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
test that the Pu must apply as a kind of
 
01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
a check on the first number so I think
 
01:42:47.070 --> 01:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
that is the way you chose to deal with
 
01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
those uncertainties to the extent that
 
01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
they exist in House Bill 549 9 and to
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge no conditions
 
01:42:55.589 --> 01:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
have changed since you acted two years
 
01:42:57.790 --> 01:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
ago that justify a different result
 
01:43:02.189 --> 01:43:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
ago additional questions I'd like to
 
01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:06.910 align:start position:0%
ago additional questions I'd like to
move

01:43:06.910 --> 01:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
move
 
01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
on so thank you uh Mr Cree for being
 
01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
here and with that I'd like to end this
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
1036 and now we can reopen the public
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
1078 and I would like to call forward
 
01:43:33.310 --> 01:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
the well the letter from the Department
 
01:43:40.109 --> 01:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
of of uh safety
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
was um signed by Mark
 
01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:47.639 align:start position:0%
doy is that a typo that is a typo oh
 
01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
okay well my my mistake I'm sorry I read
 
01:43:51.790 --> 01:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
the typo and thought that that was
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
actually your name but I guess it's Mark
 
01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
Doyle is that correct that is correct Mr
 
01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
chair thank you well thank you for being
 
01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
here let's hear what you have to say
 
01:44:01.709 --> 01:44:01.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and and
 
01:44:03.229 --> 01:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
good morning folks of the science
 
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee um
 
01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:07.910 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee um
regarding

01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:44:10.350 --> 01:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
hb178 I'd like to speak to that for just
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
a few moments and give you a perspective
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Safety which takes
 
01:44:16.589 --> 01:44:16.599 align:start position:0%
a neutral position relative to this bill
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
however there are several major
 
01:44:19.149 --> 01:44:19.159 align:start position:0%
considerations that first responder
 
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
organizations will need to address
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
interested in collocating on a
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
commercially owned wireless tower
 
01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
technically speaking the highest spot in
 
01:44:28.669 --> 01:44:28.679 align:start position:0%
the uppermost 20 ft of any new antenna
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
mount or Tower isn't always considered
 
01:44:32.109 --> 01:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
the best
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
location from an engineering perspective
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
the bill as written doesn't provide for
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
an exception forcing first respond
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
organizations only have access to that
 
01:44:42.990 --> 01:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
section of the tower should the bill be
 
01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
modified to read that space would be
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
guarant guaranteed on any new tower that
 
01:44:48.510 --> 01:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
would provide greater flexibility for a
 
01:44:50.669 --> 01:44:50.679 align:start position:0%
reversed respond organization wishing to
 
01:44:52.510 --> 01:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
expand or enhance their radio
 
01:44:54.669 --> 01:44:54.679 align:start position:0%
communications networks as an example
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire occupies
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
several Towers in Northern New Hampshire
 
01:44:59.629 --> 01:44:59.639 align:start position:0%
where access to the uppermost section
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
would be prohibited by the Federal
 
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
Communications Commission that's due to
 
01:45:05.070 --> 01:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
potential interference with Canada and
 
01:45:07.589 --> 01:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
will require extensive coordination with
 
01:45:10.109 --> 01:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
what industry candidate calls themselves
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
for our or Department of Safety radio
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
network to have the necessary space on
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
those locations currently for us to have
 
01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
location space on those towers for an
 
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate emergency communications we
 
01:45:22.589 --> 01:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
settled at under 100 ft at those
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
locations to satisfy those requirements
 
01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
and also as written The Spill specifies
 
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
that there is an order of priority by
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
which space would be potentially
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
allocated on a new tower specifically
 
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
the local municipality the town would
 
01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
have the highest priority or first right
 
01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
of refusal and if so would the town be
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
able to hold that space indefinitely for
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
example if there weren't a current need
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
for but for some future build or
 
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
expansion of their Municipal radio
 
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
network and if so having that right of
 
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
first refusal would that require a City
 
01:45:52.510 --> 01:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
County or state agency negotiate with
 
01:45:54.990 --> 01:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
the town interoperability is also
 
01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.030 align:start position:0%
the town interoperability is also
another

01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
consideration in a time where the need
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
for seamless Communications across many
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
different Radio Networks is critical to

response to a major incident having no
 
01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
flexibility could restrict the public
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
saf the agency's ability to assist in a
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
response or delay First Responders

reaching the greatest segment of the
 
01:46:43.709 --> 01:46:43.719 align:start position:0%
population for example a Tower located
 
01:46:45.390 --> 01:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
in an adjacent town along its border to
 
01:46:46.830 --> 01:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
a larger City May provide greater
 
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
coverage opportunities for that
 
01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
City and their pop population as part of
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
either their coverage footprint or their
 
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
back haul designating only one agency is
 
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
having the initial priority could
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
potentially negatively impact efficient
 
01:47:00.589 --> 01:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
response to Public Safety related calls
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
for service our other concern would be
 
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
that the commercial Tower company would
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
charge a premium for the uppermost
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
section of the Tower and in all
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
likelihood the highest in demand because
 
01:47:11.709 --> 01:47:11.719 align:start position:0%
of the real estate and that if our first
 
01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
responded organization wish to locate on
 
01:47:15.070 --> 01:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
a new tower and would be restricted to
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
the uppermost section this may translate
 
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
into paying a premi premium market rate
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
C cing them commercial tenant revenue or
 
01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
causing issues on the engineering design
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
side of the operation conversely Tower
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
owners could also charge Public Safety
 
01:47:29.229 --> 01:47:29.239 align:start position:0%
commercial Market rates for the prime
 
01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
spot since the bill doesn't reference
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
that the Spate is cost that space is
 
01:47:34.910 --> 01:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
cost free and that occupancy would be at
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
a discounted rate in summary although
 
01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:38.719 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill I think is to
 
01:47:39.790 --> 01:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
provide for greater emergency
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
communications for our first responder
 
01:47:42.669 --> 01:47:42.679 align:start position:0%
Community which we're all in very much
 
01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
favor of serious consideration of these
 
01:47:46.830 --> 01:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
issues must be taken into account to
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
avoid any unintended
 
01:47:51.149 --> 01:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
consequences I am am certainly available
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
for any questions any member of the
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
committee may have thank you for your
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
testimony questions representative McGee
 
01:47:59.189 --> 01:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr Doyle thank you
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
um my question is you know I think you
 
01:48:07.629 --> 01:48:07.639 align:start position:0%
were here and understand the intent
 
01:48:09.589 --> 01:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
maybe of the bill it is it do you think
 
01:48:11.790 --> 01:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
it's possible for us to make changes to
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
this bill and take out some of the uh
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
directive language that's inappropriate
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
in order to help him solve the problem
 
01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
he's trying to solve because I'm not
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
sure I understand how we would help him
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
do that thank you for the question I
 
01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
think it's an awesome question I did
 
01:48:27.950 --> 01:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
have a conversation with representative
 
01:48:30.189 --> 01:48:30.199 align:start position:0%
PR uh about some of the concerns
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the bill and that's the
 
01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
reason why the department of safety is
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
taking a neutral position and as I
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned to him earlier today we're
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
certainly in a position where we'd like
 
01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
to have that discussion either initially
 
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
or ongoing in the event that this
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
something has some traction later on
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
down the road we want to make sure that
 
01:48:45.870 --> 01:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that we're
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
doing as a
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
Statewide response whether that's the
 
01:48:52.669 --> 01:48:52.679 align:start position:0%
town working with the county the county
 
01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
working with the state the state working
 
01:48:56.189 --> 01:48:56.199 align:start position:0%
with the town or local city there's
 
01:48:57.589 --> 01:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
always a Communications component
 
01:48:59.470 --> 01:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
associated with it and you can't just
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
say that the particular entity that has
 
01:49:05.589 --> 01:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
the jurisdictional responsibility or or
 
01:49:07.709 --> 01:49:07.719 align:start position:0%
or authority if you will based upon
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
what's written in the bill now to have
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
first wrer refusal on that Tower may not
 
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
be the most appropriate one there are
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
certain considerations but working with
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
the localities the counties which we're
 
01:49:20.589 --> 01:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of right now as well um or
 
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
even other uh Statewide agencies which
 
01:49:24.629 --> 01:49:24.639 align:start position:0%
we do on a regular basis makes the best
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
sense when we're trying to perform or Co
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
collaborate to bring to to table some of
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.109 --> 01:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
Solutions do you need a
 
01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
followup well I guess the followup would
 
01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:42.030 align:start position:0%
followup well I guess the followup would
be

01:49:42.030 --> 01:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh maybe you don't no it was around the
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
original question which is solving his
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
problem right I'm not sure what he's
 
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
trying to solve by prescribing this type
 
01:49:55.669 --> 01:49:55.679 align:start position:0%
of a solution
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
I and maybe I can answer that and I I
 
01:50:00.910 --> 01:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
think I could put on my Public Safety um
 
01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
manager's hat back in the day when I
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
worked as a local uh first responder um
 
01:50:07.950 --> 01:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
in a town in miramac and there was
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
always a concern about being able to and
 
01:50:11.470 --> 01:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
he mentioned gaps in coverage gaps in
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
radio coverage as most of you know it's
 
01:50:15.229 --> 01:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
not a perfect world out there when it
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
comes to trying to provision help to
 
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
people who are in need of help when they
 
01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
need it because those gaps exist because
 
01:50:27.390 --> 01:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
of geographical anomalies with u the uh
 
01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
the surface departer for the Earth or
 
01:50:30.990 --> 01:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
they just don't have in this particular
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
case I think he mentioned the ability to
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
locate on Towers in and around areas
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
where those gaps currently exist
 
01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
transmission for radio signal is
 
01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
dependent upon a multitude of factors
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
and just having one Tower in one town
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't give a grant to have coverage at
 
01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
infin item throughout that jurisdiction
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
so there have to be certain engineering
 
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
studies that have to go into play to
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
actually identify where those locations
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
would be best served a lot of tower
 
01:50:58.750 --> 01:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
owners and landlords whether the
 
01:51:00.069 --> 01:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
telecommunications companies or
 
01:51:01.950 --> 01:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise will put up Towers based upon
 
01:51:03.709 --> 01:51:03.719 align:start position:0%
demand of service whether it's a private
 
01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
service or commercial service that's
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
needed and when they do that they may by
 
01:51:09.990 --> 01:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
virtue of just locating in that
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
particular area offer a solution for a
 
01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
public safety agency to collocate on
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
that Tower and fill that Gap that they
 
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
currently don't have and I think that's
 
01:51:22.109 --> 01:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
where uh representative prw was was uh
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
illustrating when he mentioned the
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
issues out on the Sea Coast and the Sea
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
Coast is not alone with that there are a
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
lot of towns and a lot of municipalities
 
01:51:30.510 --> 01:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
and counties around the state including
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
our state of New Hampshire that have
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
these gaps that exist and some are just
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
impossible to cover because the reach
 
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
isn't there because of the power of the
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
radios we don't have a geographic Tower
 
01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
in a location that addresses it but our
 
01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
first respond Community Works around
 
01:51:46.510 --> 01:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
what those challenges are and there are
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that are happening now
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
and in the future that will address a
 
01:51:50.910 --> 01:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
lot of those but I think what he's
 
01:51:52.510 --> 01:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do is just say since these
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
telecommunications carriers or the tower
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
owners themselves are going to be
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
erecting some of these um facilities it
 
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
may behoove them to offer up space on
 
01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
those locations to help facilitate radio
 
01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
communications from a public safety
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
perspective representative Harrington
 
01:52:10.510 --> 01:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chairman
 
01:52:12.430 --> 01:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
just follow up what we just said that it
 
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
may be hoov them to do it is this a uh
 
01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
potential problem that may exist in the
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
future or is it a real problem are the
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
telecommunication Tower owners are they
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
saying sorry we're not allowing you to
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
do this or is this just anticipation
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
that someone might say that in the
 
01:52:31.550 --> 01:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
future I can't speak for representative
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
PR and what his his thoughts were when
 
01:52:35.629 --> 01:52:35.639 align:start position:0%
putting this together I do know and for
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
years there have been a lot of um
 
01:52:39.790 --> 01:52:39.800 align:start position:0%
collaborations amongst some of the
 
01:52:41.790 --> 01:52:41.800 align:start position:0%
private Tower owners with local
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities to offer them space on
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
those towers as they uh construct them
 
01:52:49.069 --> 01:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
we at the department of safety work very
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
closely with a number number of private
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
and state-owned and county-owned
 
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
entities that currently have facilities
 
01:52:57.550 --> 01:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
Towers shelters in and around the state
 
01:52:58.990 --> 01:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
we have leases with some we have
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
agreements with others that don't
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
incorporate an actual monetary exchange
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
of funds to have space on those Towers
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's all dependent upon the individual
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
Tower owner themselves and whether they
 
01:53:11.790 --> 01:53:11.800 align:start position:0%
want to offer it up or not I don't know
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
if he's run into any roadblocks where a
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
tower owner has said no we're not going
 
01:53:18.589 --> 01:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
to do it or if you want to you can pay
 
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
the market price which is what we offer
 
01:53:21.629 --> 01:53:21.639 align:start position:0%
to anybody else that wants to get on
 
01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
their Tower which can be up to a couple
 
01:53:25.390 --> 01:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
hundred bucks a month up to several
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars depending upon the
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
location and the demand for the service
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
or that location for that service in the
 
01:53:33.069 --> 01:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
area thank
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
you Vice chair Thomas has a question
 
01:53:37.709 --> 01:53:37.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
question I'll just I'll repeat what I
 
01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
said earlier in the day um that I had
 
01:53:46.669 --> 01:53:46.679 align:start position:0%
contacted my fire department in lary
 
01:53:50.589 --> 01:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
who's told me that uh this bill
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
would make their negotiations easier uh
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
when they're trying to fill gaps and
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
then I heard from other Representatives
 
01:54:00.510 --> 01:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
that live in rural areas that's that
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
that have said that it was more serious
 
01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
than that that they have a lot of
 
01:54:08.910 --> 01:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
serious gaps so my question
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
is understanding we're working with a
 
01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
private entity on these towers what can
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
we do for them to not make negotiations
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
harder and to make it almost um their
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
priority to make sure that we have
 
01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
public safety and Communications because
 
01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
maybe it wasn't this true five or 10
 
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
years ago but certainly in the last
 
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
several months of this year uh the world
 
01:54:35.550 --> 01:54:35.560 align:start position:0%
has proven that there are changes
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
happening and we need to be out in front
 
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
of communications and I think it's
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon all of us to put that
 
01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
priority first so we can get
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
Communications out for the safety of our
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
people which is one of the primary
 
01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
responsibil ities of
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
government thank you for your question
 
01:54:54.550 --> 01:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
and I'll try to answer that by putting
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
on my what would I do if I were in their
 
01:54:59.149 --> 01:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
shoes and not have to speak for them
 
01:55:00.589 --> 01:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
because I think maybe they'd want to
 
01:55:03.390 --> 01:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
speak for themselves but I think in
 
01:55:05.069 --> 01:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
today's day and age where the focus has
 
01:55:05.079 --> 01:55:05.910 align:start position:0%
today's day and age where the focus has
been

01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:07.510 align:start position:0%
been
on

01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:55:10.109 --> 01:55:10.119 align:start position:0%
lately a response to a major incident
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
whether that's a natural disaster
 
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
whether that's a man-caused incident
 
01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's an AC of as salent or
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise Communications I mentioned
 
01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
before is very high on the priority list
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
when it comes to coordinating a major
 
01:55:22.589 --> 01:55:22.599 align:start position:0%
response and I think everybody
 
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
understands what some of those
 
01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
challenges look like if I were a
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
telecommunications carrier or Tower
 
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
owner or I'm inclined to go ahead and
 
01:55:34.109 --> 01:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
build or construct one I would want to
 
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
by virtue of my good nature and the
 
01:55:38.189 --> 01:55:38.199 align:start position:0%
Goodwill that go along with it reach out
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
to my local public safety agencies or
 
01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
the Statewide agencies responsible for
 
01:55:45.310 --> 01:55:45.320 align:start position:0%
coordinating a major response and say
 
01:55:47.069 --> 01:55:47.079 align:start position:0%
this is what I'm doing is this going to
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
be a help to you if I construct a tower
 
01:55:52.270 --> 01:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
here in this location and what benefit
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
can I offer you to help facilitate a
 
01:55:57.390 --> 01:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
Communications asset for a major
 
01:55:58.990 --> 01:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
response in the event that one's needed
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
in that particular area that's what I
 
01:56:01.679 --> 01:56:02.669 align:start position:0%
in that particular area that's what I
would

01:56:02.669 --> 01:56:02.679 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:56:02.679 --> 01:56:04.550 align:start position:0%
would
do

01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh follow
 
01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
up thank you uh real
 
01:56:12.430 --> 01:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
quick what would you recommend there be
 
01:56:14.990 --> 01:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
a mechanism to have to perhaps Foster
 
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.510 align:start position:0%
a mechanism to have to perhaps Foster
that

01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:20.589 --> 01:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
Goodwill there's always a thank you for
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
the question there's always a u the
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
analogy that there's a carrot and a
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
stick and I don't know if Force feeding
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
this is the way to go um my
 
01:56:35.149 --> 01:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
understanding is and I think the
 
01:56:37.069 --> 01:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
question was brought up earlier and I
 
01:56:39.229 --> 01:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
don't have any anecdotal information to
 
01:56:43.149 --> 01:56:43.159 align:start position:0%
say yay or nay that any first responder
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
agency or local municipality has been
 
01:56:47.310 --> 01:56:47.320 align:start position:0%
told no you can't locate on our Tower
 
01:56:49.629 --> 01:56:49.639 align:start position:0%
whether that was for just the offer or
 
01:56:51.790 --> 01:56:51.800 align:start position:0%
whether that was for no cost I don't
 
01:56:55.709 --> 01:56:55.719 align:start position:0%
know but I've not heard of any um of
 
01:57:00.109 --> 01:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
anybody being told no out of the gate
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't know the answer to that
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
question and I don't want to sound like
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sidest stepping it because as I had
 
01:57:08.430 --> 01:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned the tower owners the
 
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
telecommunication companies whoever it
 
01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
is that's constructing these facilities
 
01:57:13.709 --> 01:57:13.719 align:start position:0%
is in the business to make money and I
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
get it um but I think there's there's an
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to actually show
 
01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
their good nature when it comes to
 
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
facilitating a public safety agency
 
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
response or first responder response by
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
augmenting and partnering and
 
01:57:29.950 --> 01:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
collaborating with another Public Safety
 
01:57:31.870 --> 01:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
agency or a local agency to actually
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
facilitate emergency communications in
 
01:57:33.599 --> 01:57:34.910 align:start position:0%
facilitate emergency communications in
those

01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:57:37.870 --> 01:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
locations representative Bernardi who is
 
01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor has a question I'll allow
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
it because he's a
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor thank you Mr
 
01:57:48.669 --> 01:57:48.679 align:start position:0%
chairman so I can testify to the reason
 
01:57:50.350 --> 01:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
and it deals with the fact that there
 
01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:53.510 align:start position:0%
and it deals with the fact that there
are

01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:57:56.910 --> 01:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
significant gaps in coverage in the Sea
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
Coast Area that's area I I come from um
 
01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
and I I understand what you're saying
 
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
about the various uh potential legal
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
issues so my question is what is the
 
01:58:14.589 --> 01:58:14.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety doing to understand
 
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
what these gaps are and to help the
 
01:58:19.510 --> 01:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
local towns and communities deal with
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
them because right now in my towns I
 
01:58:26.910 --> 01:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
don't see any input from Department of
 
01:58:29.470 --> 01:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
Safety to address this hence the
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for your question and I I
 
01:58:33.629 --> 01:58:33.639 align:start position:0%
know our Statewide interoperability
 
01:58:34.750 --> 01:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
coordinator and the Statewide
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
interoperability executive committee uh
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
have had conversations with some of the
 
01:58:41.069 --> 01:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
emergency managers out on the Sea Coast
 
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
and we do know because of the terrain
 
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
out there and the lack of some of these
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
antennas and Towers it becomes a real
 
01:58:51.270 --> 01:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
challenge to facilitate emergency
 
01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:53.800 align:start position:0%
communications we don't have an answer
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
where we're able to actually as you can
 
01:58:58.510 --> 01:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
imagine real estate is difficult to come
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
by everywhere nobody wants nobody wants
 
01:59:02.910 --> 01:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
a radio communications Tower in their
 
01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
backyard so it becomes even more
 
01:59:06.750 --> 01:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
challenging so what is it that we can do
 
01:59:09.310 --> 01:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
to help facilitate we've talked to and
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
we actually coordinate with many of our
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
Wireless Partners whether they're with
 
01:59:16.109 --> 01:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
AT&amp;T whether they're with Verizon
 
01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
Wireless whether they're with T-Mobile
 
01:59:20.189 --> 01:59:20.199 align:start position:0%
to help facilitate and we had heard a
 
01:59:21.629 --> 01:59:21.639 align:start position:0%
little bit about Broadband discussion
 
01:59:24.109 --> 01:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
earlier today facilitate augmenting land
 
01:59:25.629 --> 01:59:25.639 align:start position:0%
mobile radio communications with a
 
01:59:27.550 --> 01:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
Broadband solution and it could be any
 
01:59:29.910 --> 01:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
number of things some of these radio
 
01:59:31.709 --> 01:59:31.719 align:start position:0%
systems that are out there right now
 
01:59:33.310 --> 01:59:33.320 align:start position:0%
actually have the ability to transmit
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
over land mobile radio and over the LTE
 
01:59:39.510 --> 01:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
systems which are your cellular networks
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
at the same time Department of Safety
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
does not have those we do not use those
 
01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
right now but those capabilities do
 
01:59:48.030 --> 01:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
exist depending upon the radio
 
01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and the vendor that the
 
01:59:52.229 --> 01:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
individual town and municipality goes
 
01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
with and there are a number of them now
 
01:59:55.069 --> 01:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
that are out there that offer some of
 
01:59:57.750 --> 01:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
these Solutions I would suggest that in
 
01:59:59.629 --> 01:59:59.639 align:start position:0%
those types of locations that
 
02:00:01.229 --> 02:00:01.239 align:start position:0%
engineering studies be done and you
 
02:00:03.069 --> 02:00:03.079 align:start position:0%
consult with individuals who are experts
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
in that particular area to help
 
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
facilitate a conversation between the
 
02:00:09.069 --> 02:00:09.079 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications carriers and the land
 
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
mobile radio vendor in those particular
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
towns or the county and or Rockingham
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
County has a huge footprint on in that
 
02:00:16.830 --> 02:00:16.840 align:start position:0%
area to talk a little bit about what
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
some of those solutions would look like
 
02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
and how they can better facilitate
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
emergency communications across that
 
02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:22.510 align:start position:0%
emergency communications across that
wider

02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
wider
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
swath follow
 
02:00:29.229 --> 02:00:29.239 align:start position:0%
up uh thank you so uh the the Broadband
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
problem is even worse there are bigger
 
02:00:34.149 --> 02:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
holes in the Broadband than if you use
 
02:00:38.910 --> 02:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
radio so um I understand your uh
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation to do engineering studies
 
02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
but it's it's going to require more than
 
02:00:47.629 --> 02:00:47.639 align:start position:0%
that it's going to and likely is going
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:52.910 --> 02:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
and again thank you and I I appreciate
 
02:00:54.510 --> 02:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
your comment because I agree it's going
 
02:00:56.830 --> 02:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
to it's going to involve quite a few
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
different partners in any collaborative
 
02:01:00.750 --> 02:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
effort to enhance emergency
 
02:01:02.350 --> 02:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
communications regardless of where those
 
02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
gaps are um and they don't just exist on
 
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast I know anecdotally you
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
talked about them happening over on the
 
02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast we have a lot of areas up in
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
the north country as well as out the
 
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
western part of the state that are still
 
02:01:15.870 --> 02:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
underserved because of the lack of
 
02:01:17.790 --> 02:01:17.800 align:start position:0%
broadband there's an initiative right
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
now to make sure that broad band is um
 
02:01:22.830 --> 02:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
provisioned in areas that are under
 
02:01:24.270 --> 02:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
repesentative it don't have that
 
02:01:27.149 --> 02:01:27.159 align:start position:0%
capability and the ability to do that
 
02:01:30.189 --> 02:01:30.199 align:start position:0%
provides another opportunity to help
 
02:01:32.229 --> 02:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
augment emergency communications once
 
02:01:35.229 --> 02:01:35.239 align:start position:0%
that expansion is
 
02:01:37.709 --> 02:01:37.719 align:start position:0%
conducted further questions
 
02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
02:01:42.669 --> 02:01:42.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you uh for
 
02:01:45.790 --> 02:01:45.800 align:start position:0%
being here and taking my question um in
 
02:01:47.790 --> 02:01:47.800 align:start position:0%
the second paragraph of your testimony
 
02:01:51.310 --> 02:01:51.320 align:start position:0%
you talk about um um the communities up
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
north uh that they can't this wouldn't
 
02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
work for them being at the the top 20
 
02:01:58.990 --> 02:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
feet of a tower because of the
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
FCC and so um you say that quote we've
 
02:02:04.990 --> 02:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
settled at under 100 fet for those
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
locations my my question is is that 100
 
02:02:12.069 --> 02:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
fet in law and the the second part of my
 
02:02:15.550 --> 02:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
question is um if you're using 100 ft
 
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
under 100 ft up north could that be a
 
02:02:20.069 --> 02:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
standard that's used throughout New
 
02:02:21.990 --> 02:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for your question
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas and I think the
 
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
there's a two-part answer there and
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
number one it's not set in law or
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
statute and I want to get back
 
02:02:32.589 --> 02:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
to relegating as to where any type of
 
02:02:34.149 --> 02:02:34.159 align:start position:0%
communications infrastructure should be
 
02:02:35.709 --> 02:02:35.719 align:start position:0%
on a tower again because radio
 
02:02:37.629 --> 02:02:37.639 align:start position:0%
communications is
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
not is not static it's Dynamic depending
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
upon a multitude of um factors
 
02:02:46.510 --> 02:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
topography distance in which you're
 
02:02:48.109 --> 02:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
going to try to cover whether it's a
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
microwave uh shot between two locations
 
02:02:52.589 --> 02:02:52.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's a transmitter whether it's
 
02:02:54.790 --> 02:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
a receiver antenna or otherwise so
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
depending upon I think the the question
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
is or the answer is it depends and it
 
02:03:00.310 --> 02:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
depends upon what it is you're trying to
 
02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
do whether you're trying to transmit to
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
a greater population whether you're
 
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
trying to receive a transmission from a
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
first responder to get it back home to
 
02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
where it needs to go is all going to
 
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
depend upon where that antenna needs to
 
02:03:17.589 --> 02:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
itself further
 
02:03:24.910 --> 02:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair and thank you
 
02:03:29.550 --> 02:03:29.560 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today um going back
 
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
to an earlier
 
02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
question it's my understanding that do
 
02:03:35.149 --> 02:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety is not the business
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
of erecting Towers so there's only so
 
02:03:39.870 --> 02:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
much that you can actually do and we can
 
02:03:42.629 --> 02:03:42.639 align:start position:0%
do through legislation but the tow but
 
02:03:45.189 --> 02:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
where we have the real need are in
 
02:03:48.510 --> 02:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
places where we're talking about the top
 
02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
20 foot of a tower that doesn't
 
02:03:53.350 --> 02:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
exist my understanding is please correct
 
02:03:55.629 --> 02:03:55.639 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong this is the gist my
 
02:03:59.069 --> 02:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
question um we're not building Towers in
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
those areas because the uh
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
telecommunications industry deems them
 
02:04:06.030 --> 02:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
to be unprofitable so rather than that
 
02:04:08.189 --> 02:04:08.199 align:start position:0%
they are focusing their efforts upon
 
02:04:11.549 --> 02:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
metropolitan areas beefing up their 5G
 
02:04:13.709 --> 02:04:13.719 align:start position:0%
and not really looking to develop the
 
02:04:15.549 --> 02:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
more rural parts of our state where this
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
type of service especially for first
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
responder is so badly needed is that a
 
02:04:19.119 --> 02:04:20.310 align:start position:0%
responder is so badly needed is that a
correct

02:04:20.310 --> 02:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:04:22.390 --> 02:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
characterization in in working with a
 
02:04:25.229 --> 02:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
number of the um Wireless
 
02:04:25.239 --> 02:04:26.830 align:start position:0%
number of the um Wireless
telecommunications

02:04:26.830 --> 02:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
telecommunications
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
carriers their focus from a uh business
 
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
perspective has to be where the need
 
02:04:35.229 --> 02:04:35.239 align:start position:0%
exists and again they have to make money
 
02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh the difference is that with the A&amp;T
 
02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
um supported first net program first net
 
02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
is a system um designed by the federal
 
02:04:45.790 --> 02:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
government I say designed by but the
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
board is actually um hosted by the
 
02:04:49.149 --> 02:04:49.159 align:start position:0%
federal government to actually make sure
 
02:04:50.830 --> 02:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
that First Responders have the ability
 
02:04:54.589 --> 02:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
to use that um Public Safety Broadband
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
Network that's earmarked specifically
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
for our First Responders along the first
 
02:05:00.549 --> 02:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
net uh platform and the first net
 
02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
platform is being built in locations
 
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
that not only serve a commercial purpose
 
02:05:07.629 --> 02:05:07.639 align:start position:0%
but will also serve a first responder
 
02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
purpose but it's not an automatic either
 
02:05:11.950 --> 02:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
um it's something that they work very
 
02:05:13.629 --> 02:05:13.639 align:start position:0%
closely with our Statewide
 
02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
interoperability executive committee to
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
actually design a plan we just actually
 
02:05:19.390 --> 02:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
finish the first five your roll out of
 
02:05:20.830 --> 02:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
the first net system here in New
 
02:05:22.589 --> 02:05:22.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they're actually uh
 
02:05:24.270 --> 02:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
discussing and conversing right now to
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
find out what the next stage of that's
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
going to be for the next 5 years and
 
02:05:30.549 --> 02:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
that might include that might include
 
02:05:34.069 --> 02:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
construction of towers in locations that
 
02:05:36.669 --> 02:05:36.679 align:start position:0%
would otherwise be overlooked because of
 
02:05:39.069 --> 02:05:39.079 align:start position:0%
the lack of a commercial need but
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
there's a greater need for first
 
02:05:43.149 --> 02:05:43.159 align:start position:0%
responder desire in those locations
 
02:05:45.069 --> 02:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
because of lack of land mobile radio
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
coverage and you're right the department
 
02:05:48.189 --> 02:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
of safety is not in the business of
 
02:05:50.589 --> 02:05:50.599 align:start position:0%
building Towers unless we absolutely
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
need to as a matter of fact we only have
 
02:05:55.149 --> 02:05:55.159 align:start position:0%
the department of safety owns only seven
 
02:05:58.109 --> 02:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
Towers a Lo uh around the state and
 
02:06:00.109 --> 02:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
locations around the state where we have
 
02:06:02.589 --> 02:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
our radio equipment but we actually
 
02:06:05.229 --> 02:06:05.239 align:start position:0%
collocate on about 49 different
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
locations around the state and some of
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
those are with some private enenes some
 
02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
of those are with other state agencies
 
02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
like Department of Natural and cultural
 
02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
resources so we try to figure out where
 
02:06:16.709 --> 02:06:16.719 align:start position:0%
it is that we need to have a footprint
 
02:06:18.669 --> 02:06:18.679 align:start position:0%
and we try to build out upon that based
 
02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
on existing
 
02:06:23.470 --> 02:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
locations representative Ms has a
 
02:06:26.430 --> 02:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you a quick one I hope
 
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and I just
 
02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
want to uh you know confirm what uh
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bernard Bernardi said
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
that there are you know very significant
 
02:06:39.790 --> 02:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
holes on the Sea Coast I mean I live I
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
live in Hampton um and I also um want to
 
02:06:46.589 --> 02:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
you know I think follow up on on a
 
02:06:48.270 --> 02:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
comment that you made about you know the
 
02:06:50.790 --> 02:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
fact that that we we we probably need to
 
02:06:52.669 --> 02:06:52.679 align:start position:0%
have a more Regional or even Statewide
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
approach to solving some of these
 
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
problems because I know um I live in
 
02:06:59.069 --> 02:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
Hampton and to improve cell phone
 
02:07:03.310 --> 02:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
service in Hampton um we need a tower in
 
02:07:05.350 --> 02:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
Northampton um just because of the
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
geography so with that in mind would it
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
you know if we were to proceed with this
 
02:07:13.589 --> 02:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
bill would it make more sense to instead
 
02:07:16.589 --> 02:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
of giving each individual Town and
 
02:07:20.950 --> 02:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
County kind of first Di on Space to
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
instead say that um that space needs to
 
02:07:28.189 --> 02:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
be allocated to you know the department
 
02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
of safety so that the department of
 
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
safety can then perhaps through the
 
02:07:38.669 --> 02:07:38.679 align:start position:0%
um through the Statewide interop
 
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
operability executive committee the
 
02:07:42.830 --> 02:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
state could then determine that okay
 
02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:45.719 align:start position:0%
there's a tower going up in Northampton
 
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
that will help the issue in in Hampton
 
02:07:49.109 --> 02:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
and then there's a to Tower going in
 
02:07:50.750 --> 02:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
Hampton that'll help the tower the
 
02:07:52.430 --> 02:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
issues in Seabrook so that it becomes
 
02:07:54.750 --> 02:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
more of a integrated solution as opposed
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
to a town Bytown solution thank you for
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
your question and I would suggest that
 
02:08:01.830 --> 02:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be the responsibility of the
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety to uh be that
 
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
deciding factor however what we've
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
always done and this is something that
 
02:08:09.910 --> 02:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
we did since the beginning of the
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
establishment of the Statewide
 
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
interoperability executive committee is
 
02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
invite local stakeholders whether the're
 
02:08:17.629 --> 02:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs the fire chiefs the
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management directors to these
 
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
um meetings that we have quarterly to
 
02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:24.079 align:start position:0%
have these conversations about what we
 
02:08:26.109 --> 02:08:26.119 align:start position:0%
can do to help enhance radio coverage or
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
land mobile radio coverage or even
 
02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.119 align:start position:0%
Broadband capabilities if they need back
 
02:08:32.430 --> 02:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
haul associated with their radio network
 
02:08:35.510 --> 02:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
and find solutions that may be existing
 
02:08:37.069 --> 02:08:37.079 align:start position:0%
that they're not aware of that maybe the
 
02:08:38.589 --> 02:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
department of s safety can help
 
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
facilitate whether it's having a local
 
02:08:42.510 --> 02:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
meeting that would include Emergency
 
02:08:44.069 --> 02:08:44.079 align:start position:0%
Management directors or Fire Chiefs or
 
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs from surrounding agencies
 
02:08:47.709 --> 02:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
and jurisdictions to come to the table
 
02:08:50.669 --> 02:08:50.679 align:start position:0%
to discuss with whoever the landlord
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
landl landlord or owner of the tower is
 
02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
to facilitate that conversation I think
 
02:08:57.750 --> 02:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's something that we could certainly
 
02:09:01.149 --> 02:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
do representative n rolds has a
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um I want
 
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
to my question gonna hearken back to
 
02:09:09.750 --> 02:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
something that you said earlier just uh
 
02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
I think kind of quickly in your in your
 
02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
testimony um as a policy maker I
 
02:09:19.069 --> 02:09:19.079 align:start position:0%
always want to try to get to the root of
 
02:09:22.549 --> 02:09:22.559 align:start position:0%
a problem I see this bill uh as an
 
02:09:24.629 --> 02:09:24.639 align:start position:0%
attempt that you know to address a
 
02:09:26.549 --> 02:09:26.559 align:start position:0%
problem but I'm not sure that it's it's
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
aiming in the right direction uh I think
 
02:09:31.069 --> 02:09:31.079 align:start position:0%
we've all heard the the saying you know
 
02:09:33.870 --> 02:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
some wag in the past once said we have
 
02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
met the enemy
 
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
and he is US isn't the isn't the root of
 
02:09:44.589 --> 02:09:44.599 align:start position:0%
the problem of large gaps in uh cellular
 
02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
coverage and thus radio coverage or the
 
02:09:49.629 --> 02:09:49.639 align:start position:0%
lack of towers in certain certain places
 
02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
isn't the root of that problem local
 
02:09:55.229 --> 02:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
opposition to building such Towers I you
 
02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
you made reference I think you said your
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
words are exactly no one wants to look
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
at a tower so is the issue that private
 
02:10:08.350 --> 02:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
companies who manage to build a tower
 
02:10:10.830 --> 02:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
aren't giving
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh space you know Public
 
02:10:16.990 --> 02:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
Safety uh agencies space on those Towers
 
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
or is is it that
 
02:10:22.030 --> 02:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
private companies want to build towers
 
02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
but they can't because local towns and I
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
won't name any on the Sea Coast but um I
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
I'm neighbor to some won't let Towers
 
02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:33.510 align:start position:0%
I'm neighbor to some won't let Towers
get

02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:10:36.189 --> 02:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
built thank you for your question and I
 
02:10:37.629 --> 02:10:37.639 align:start position:0%
I don't have an answer to that because
 
02:10:39.189 --> 02:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not involved in a lot of that
 
02:10:41.669 --> 02:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
discussion at the local level um other
 
02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
than you hear and I say hear anecdotally
 
02:10:47.310 --> 02:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
from some of the discussion with some of
 
02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
our Emergency Management directors that
 
02:10:53.310 --> 02:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
it's difficult um to get those approvals
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't know what that means
 
02:10:56.350 --> 02:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily other than again what I've
 
02:10:58.109 --> 02:10:58.119 align:start position:0%
heard is that it becomes difficult
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
because as you can imagine the confined
 
02:11:03.149 --> 02:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
nature of both the population and the
 
02:11:04.589 --> 02:11:04.599 align:start position:0%
commercial districts over on the Sea
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
Coast I I think it becomes a challenge
 
02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
to try to get a tower in any of those
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
locations that folks might consider um
 
02:11:17.229 --> 02:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
is a a barrier to the scenic beauty of
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast and that becomes a
 
02:11:21.069 --> 02:11:21.079 align:start position:0%
challenge I don't have an answer for
 
02:11:23.229 --> 02:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
that uh but there are solutions that are
 
02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
available that may not necessarily
 
02:11:27.229 --> 02:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
necessitate the construction of a tower
 
02:11:29.149 --> 02:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
there are small cells or fto cells and
 
02:11:30.669 --> 02:11:30.679 align:start position:0%
some other things that are available
 
02:11:32.470 --> 02:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
that certainly don't have the far reach
 
02:11:34.350 --> 02:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
that a cell tower does but can provide
 
02:11:37.390 --> 02:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
some very localized access to Cellular
 
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
Communications but may not help the
 
02:11:42.990 --> 02:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
radio communications piece so I guess
 
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
the answer is I don't
 
02:11:49.390 --> 02:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
know okay seeing no further questions I
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
want to thank Mr Doyle for his uh
 
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
testimony here this morning and call on
 
02:11:57.390 --> 02:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
the last speaker on House Bill 1078 and
 
02:11:59.470 --> 02:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
that's representative Deb Hobson from
 
02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:00.430 align:start position:0%
that's representative Deb Hobson from
East

02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
East
 
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative and uh
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
I'd ask you to be brief as we have one
 
02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
more public hearing to get to before our
 
02:12:18.069 --> 02:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
lunch break I will be super brief thank
 
02:12:19.310 --> 02:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so much members of the
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Deb Hobson I'm
 
02:12:23.229 --> 02:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
representative out of Rockingham
 
02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
district 14 I didn't even know that I
 
02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
was going to speak today I had several
 
02:12:28.950 --> 02:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
other bills so uh it's by the luck of
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
the draw that I'm here I wanted to um
 
02:12:35.669 --> 02:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
speak in support of this measure um as a
 
02:12:38.030 --> 02:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
a representative that meets with my uh
 
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
East Kingston Fire Department and other
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
area towns um we know that something has
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
to happen to increase communication uh
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
for about 4 years years we've been
 
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
meeting with members of the First
 
02:12:54.310 --> 02:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
Responders and um some of the things
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
that have come into play with this um
 
02:13:00.430 --> 02:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
situation obviously the topography um
 
02:13:03.189 --> 02:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
has been an issue we've got very hilly
 
02:13:07.629 --> 02:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
terrain um the um I guess inconsistence
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies between digital and
 
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
analog um the First Responders are
 
02:13:15.669 --> 02:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
having to carry around multiple radios
 
02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
so that they can uh get all the
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
information they need about a particular
 
02:13:23.229 --> 02:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
service call um loud noises will cause
 
02:13:27.549 --> 02:13:27.559 align:start position:0%
digital to go out and our um fire chief
 
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
in East Kingston has um talked about uh

the security of his First Responders not
 
02:13:36.830 --> 02:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
knowing what kind of a situation he's
 
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to
 
02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:39.709 align:start position:0%
they're going to
enter

02:13:39.709 --> 02:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
enter
 
02:13:43.310 --> 02:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to point those things out
 
02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
this seemed to be a um lowcost
 
02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable solution and we do have have
 
02:13:51.950 --> 02:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
issues in the towns that
 
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
um people will vote down cell towers but
 
02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
I do think that we have several towers
 
02:14:00.629 --> 02:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
that are going up and um I think that
 
02:14:03.910 --> 02:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
this is happening uh cell towers are uh
 
02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
having repeaters placed on the top uh
 
02:14:09.430 --> 02:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
portions of cell towers in certain areas
 
02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
of the state so we thought that this
 
02:14:14.189 --> 02:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
would be a good measure um so you know
 
02:14:16.430 --> 02:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
certainly some good things have been uh
 
02:14:18.669 --> 02:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
brought up in this hearing and I would
 
02:14:21.149 --> 02:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
just ask that um we not put this off any
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
longer I know we have a state
 
02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
interoperability uh task force but um I
 
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
think that our First Responders need a
 
02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
little bit more fast action so that's
 
02:14:36.109 --> 02:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
that's all I have thank you thank you
 
02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative Hopson any questions for
 
02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:41.030 align:start position:0%
representative Hopson any questions for
the

02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:43.390 --> 02:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr chairman um one
 
02:14:48.069 --> 02:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
issue that was brought up briefly earli
 
02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been touched on much in all
 
02:14:52.109 --> 02:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
this discussion is the legality of doing
 
02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
this we're talking about private
 
02:14:55.629 --> 02:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
property that's owned by private
 
02:14:57.790 --> 02:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
companies and we're saying we're going
 
02:15:00.390 --> 02:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
to apparently this law would force them
 
02:15:03.549 --> 02:15:03.559 align:start position:0%
to give access to government uh is that
 
02:15:05.709 --> 02:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
even legal to do that has anyone looked
 
02:15:06.990 --> 02:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
into that part of it because I haven't
 
02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
heard it addressed at all you know I
 
02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer thank you for the
 
02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
question I don't have an answer for that
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I don't thank
 
02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:19.149 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I don't thank
you

02:15:19.149 --> 02:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:15:21.189 --> 02:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions for the
 
02:15:22.990 --> 02:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
representative I'm going to close the
 
02:15:24.510 --> 02:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
02:15:29.790 --> 02:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
1078 and representative Thomas will now
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:48.470 align:start position:0%
 
1627

02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
1627
 
02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
while representative o is preparing to
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
testify I would remind uh uh our
 
02:15:56.109 --> 02:15:56.119 align:start position:0%
committee members that um the only that
 
02:15:58.589 --> 02:15:58.599 align:start position:0%
stands between representative OES your
 
02:16:02.549 --> 02:16:02.559 align:start position:0%
and your questions is lunch and so um
 
02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
make your questions brief and I think
 
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
this is a relatively simple bill so
 
02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative o explain what you are
 
02:16:13.629 --> 02:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
doing thank you actually it's questions
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
that stand between the members and lunch
 
02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
not me
 
02:16:22.549 --> 02:16:22.559 align:start position:0%
the house bill
 
02:16:26.149 --> 02:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
1627 is the result of
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
a bill that we passed last year House
 
02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:30.030 align:start position:0%
a bill that we passed last year House
Bill

02:16:30.030 --> 02:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
219 which set up a study committee to
 
02:16:34.950 --> 02:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not certain
 
02:16:38.589 --> 02:16:38.599 align:start position:0%
statutes that were codified under title
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
34 titled Public Utilities should be
 
02:16:45.230 --> 02:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
moved to Title 20
 
02:16:47.790 --> 02:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
Transportation most of these statutes re
 
02:16:51.309 --> 02:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
relate to Railroad activities which the
 
02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission did at one
 
02:16:57.549 --> 02:16:57.559 align:start position:0%
time regulate but stopped
 
02:17:01.070 --> 02:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
regulating those particular activities
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
back in the 1920s or
 
02:17:07.230 --> 02:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
1930s so all this bill does so the
 
02:17:09.389 --> 02:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
result of that study committee was we
 
02:17:11.709 --> 02:17:11.719 align:start position:0%
looked at these statutes and said yes
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
they should be moved from Public
 
02:17:15.750 --> 02:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
Utilities to Transportation or in one
 
02:17:18.270 --> 02:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
case Department of Safety
 
02:17:23.230 --> 02:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
and so what this bill does is it does or
 
02:17:26.990 --> 02:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
authorizes uh those chapter transfers so
 
02:17:29.790 --> 02:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
if you look at lines 1 through three of
 
02:17:32.429 --> 02:17:32.439 align:start position:0%
the bill it says chapter transferred
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation RSA 367 on the formation
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
and Union of railroad corporations
 
02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
leases extensions is hereby transferred
 
02:17:45.830 --> 02:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
to Title 20 and shall be red as RSA 243
 
02:17:51.790 --> 02:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
consisting of 23 2431 through
 
02:17:54.589 --> 02:17:54.599 align:start position:0%
24357 and it just goes on like that
 
02:17:57.309 --> 02:17:57.319 align:start position:0%
throughout the text of the entire Bill
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
transferring one bill to
 
02:18:01.679 --> 02:18:03.190 align:start position:0%
transferring one bill to
another

02:18:03.190 --> 02:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:18:08.349 --> 02:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
and lines if you go to page two lines 20
 
02:18:11.549 --> 02:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
through the end of that page and the
 
02:18:14.990 --> 02:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
lines all the lines on page three are
 
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
just Corrections that are
 
02:18:22.629 --> 02:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
required by the removal
 
02:18:26.349 --> 02:18:26.359 align:start position:0%
of these chapters from one title to
 
02:18:29.549 --> 02:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
another so it's strictly a housekeeping
 
02:18:32.150 --> 02:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
puts statutory language where it should
 
02:18:41.150 --> 02:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
go in the proper title under our
 
02:18:45.270 --> 02:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
statutes and I have a letter that was
 
02:18:48.990 --> 02:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
sent to me yesterday by the Public
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission that
 
02:18:56.429 --> 02:18:56.439 align:start position:0%
says re hb1 1627 dear chairman Vose Vice
 
02:18:57.950 --> 02:18:57.960 align:start position:0%

express its support of hb1 1627 this
 
02:19:06.030 --> 02:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
bill would recodified statutes currently
 
02:19:10.589 --> 02:19:10.599 align:start position:0%
found under RSA title 34 entitled Public
 
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
public utilities which no longer relate
 
02:19:15.709 --> 02:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
to the regulation of Public Public
 
02:19:17.870 --> 02:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
Utilities the commission defer ref to
 
02:19:19.589 --> 02:19:19.599 align:start position:0%
the committee and relevant State
 
02:19:21.549 --> 02:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
agencies regarding how these statutes
 
02:19:23.150 --> 02:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
should be recodified
 
02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
it thanks Chairman's Vos for sponsoring
 
02:19:28.349 --> 02:19:28.359 align:start position:0%

members of the committee received that
 
02:19:39.790 --> 02:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
letter maybe they did but I just wanted
 
02:19:43.230 --> 02:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
to read that into the record um just in
 
02:19:45.709 --> 02:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
case and with that I'd be happy to take

02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:19.840 align:start position:0%

both the Department of Transportation
 
02:20:50.830 --> 02:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
and the department of safety and they
 
02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
were in agreement that these statues
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
should be moved and were supportive of
 
02:20:56.560 --> 02:20:59.710 align:start position:0%
should be moved and were supportive of
the

02:20:59.710 --> 02:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%

just no no opposition to this bill this
 
02:21:12.349 --> 02:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
is a as you said it's just cleaning up
 
02:21:14.150 --> 02:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
but you had mentioned that one case was
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
referred to the Department of Safety is
 
02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
that what starts on line one on page two
 
02:21:21.990 --> 02:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
and goes
 
02:21:25.389 --> 02:21:25.399 align:start position:0%
to 16 is that is that what you're
 
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
talking about the one case that goes to
 
02:21:35.670 --> 02:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.110 --> 02:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
Safety actually it goes from line one to
 
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
line two
 
02:21:46.349 --> 02:21:46.359 align:start position:0%
yes lines three and Beyond are uh
 
02:21:48.750 --> 02:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
corrected reference
 
02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
and necessitated by the move in lines
 
02:21:54.349 --> 02:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
one and two 14 and
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
15 yes that's another TR chapter that's
 
02:22:06.429 --> 02:22:06.439 align:start position:0%
been transferred yes okay all right just
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to understand thank
 
02:22:12.910 --> 02:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Ms thank you Mr
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank thank you uh Mr
 
02:22:20.190 --> 02:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I I am very hungry but my
 
02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
sense of public duty is uh overriding my
 
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
stomach right now um just a quick
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
question on um page
 
02:22:33.550 --> 02:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
two um line 18 it talks about inserting
 
02:22:35.630 --> 02:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
the following new
 
02:22:39.469 --> 02:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
subdivision is that language new or is
 
02:22:42.190 --> 02:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
that moving something from somewhere
 
02:22:44.550 --> 02:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
else that's moving something from
 
02:22:46.349 --> 02:22:46.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere else which was one of the
 
02:22:50.230 --> 02:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
report followup followup so why why is
 
02:22:59.830 --> 02:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:01.950 --> 02:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
subdivision I don't have the study
 
02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
committee report right in front of me
 
02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative Corman do you remember
 
02:23:07.670 --> 02:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
what the circumstances
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
were it's in the study committee report
 
02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
I would refer you to that report uh to
 
02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
get an answer to your question actually
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
I can I can Venture a guess
 
02:23:20.469 --> 02:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
and that is uh the other parts of this
 
02:23:24.830 --> 02:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
bill are renumbering rsas entirely this
 
02:23:27.230 --> 02:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
one is actually just about a
 
02:23:29.830 --> 02:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
section and I I think with sections we
 
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
have to move them a section at a time my
 
02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
question is is it a new program or not
 
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's an existing program that's just
 
02:23:40.910 --> 02:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
being yeah it's just moving the text
 
02:23:42.990 --> 02:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
it's an existing piece of Statute that's
 
02:23:45.389 --> 02:23:45.399 align:start position:0%
just being
 
02:23:47.870 --> 02:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
moved seeing no question questions and
 
02:23:50.349 --> 02:23:50.359 align:start position:0%
seeing having no other speakers here
 
02:23:53.510 --> 02:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you m uh representative o and I
 
02:23:55.630 --> 02:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
declare this public hearing
 
02:23:59.150 --> 02:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
closed and I further declare that our
 
02:24:02.030 --> 02:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
session is adjourned for lunch until
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:16.000 --> 03:30:50.870 align:start position:0%
 
then

03:30:50.870 --> 03:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:54.469 --> 03:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
it's 1:30 and I would like to now open a
 
03:30:57.150 --> 03:30:57.160 align:start position:0%

release of polluting emissions including
 
03:31:06.830 --> 03:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
cloud seating weather
 
03:31:09.510 --> 03:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
modification excessive electromagnetic
 
03:31:12.830 --> 03:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
radio frequency and microwave radiation
 
03:31:15.150 --> 03:31:15.160 align:start position:0%
and making penalties for violation of
 
03:31:18.030 --> 03:31:18.040 align:start position:0%

legislation good afternoon and welcome
 
03:31:27.359 --> 03:31:29.990 align:start position:0%
legislation good afternoon and welcome
to

03:31:29.990 --> 03:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:31.710 --> 03:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
St good
 
03:31:33.389 --> 03:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you members of the
 
03:31:36.750 --> 03:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:39.790 --> 03:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
today let me just first say this I have
 
03:31:42.389 --> 03:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
never received so much positive feedback
 
03:31:44.950 --> 03:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
from a bill that I've put in this is
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
It's been insane I've had people contact
 
03:31:48.349 --> 03:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
me from all over the country uh South
 
03:31:50.550 --> 03:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
Dakota sen got in touch with me among
 
03:31:52.710 --> 03:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
other people it's been really really
 
03:31:54.550 --> 03:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
impressive so I want to thank everybody
 
03:31:56.550 --> 03:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
that came today first off and just the
 
03:31:58.550 --> 03:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
support I've had for this but this bill
 
03:32:01.110 --> 03:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
comes about because of quite frankly
 
03:32:03.870 --> 03:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
pollution being instituted implemented
 
03:32:05.990 --> 03:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
in our atmosphere from the government
 
03:32:08.670 --> 03:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
under the aices of countering global
 
03:32:13.110 --> 03:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
warming and increasing rainfall snow and
 
03:32:15.510 --> 03:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
and a number of other things that people
 
03:32:17.229 --> 03:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
much smer than myself will talk about
 
03:32:20.349 --> 03:32:20.359 align:start position:0%
after I step down but I want to bring up
 
03:32:23.790 --> 03:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
quite quickly that Mexico a year ago
 
03:32:27.070 --> 03:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
banned geoengineering in 2010 there was
 
03:32:29.750 --> 03:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
an international ban 190 countries I
 
03:32:32.110 --> 03:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
believe signed on to that yes and then
 
03:32:34.910 --> 03:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
Mexico last year did it again in
 
03:32:37.830 --> 03:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
reinstituted because of a company make
 
03:32:37.840 --> 03:32:38.910 align:start position:0%
reinstituted because of a company make
sunsets

03:32:38.910 --> 03:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
sunsets
 
03:32:40.990 --> 03:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
Incorporated changing the color of of a
 
03:32:43.469 --> 03:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
Sunset and they weren't happy about it
 
03:32:46.269 --> 03:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
so from their statement I just want to
 
03:32:49.309 --> 03:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:52.309 --> 03:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
words and of course I don't have that up
 
03:32:52.319 --> 03:32:58.910 align:start position:0%
words and of course I don't have that up
right

03:32:58.910 --> 03:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:01.630 --> 03:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
now the government of Mexico reiterates
 
03:33:02.990 --> 03:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
its unavoidable commitment to the
 
03:33:04.229 --> 03:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
protection and well-being of the
 
03:33:05.750 --> 03:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
population against practices that
 
03:33:07.110 --> 03:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
generate risks to human and
 
03:33:08.550 --> 03:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
environmental security working in a
 
03:33:10.110 --> 03:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
coordinated rigorous and responsible
 
03:33:11.990 --> 03:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
manner for the well being of the people
 
03:33:12.000 --> 03:33:12.950 align:start position:0%
manner for the well being of the people
of

03:33:12.950 --> 03:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:33:16.910 --> 03:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
Mexico and I think that's pretty pretty
 
03:33:17.910 --> 03:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
impressive because there's a lot of
 
03:33:19.750 --> 03:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
things that happen in Mexico that don't
 
03:33:21.630 --> 03:33:21.640 align:start position:0%
happen in the United States and the fact
 
03:33:23.870 --> 03:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
that they're regulating geoengineering
 
03:33:26.309 --> 03:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
more so than the United States is is
 
03:33:28.030 --> 03:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
something that we need to take a look at
 
03:33:30.870 --> 03:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
and especially in light of the damage
 
03:33:32.110 --> 03:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
that has occurred from excessive
 
03:33:34.389 --> 03:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
flooding and other catastrophes that
 
03:33:36.910 --> 03:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
have affected New Hampshire particular
 
03:33:39.110 --> 03:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
and I just find so I don't know if this
 
03:33:40.269 --> 03:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
is actually going to go forward but I
 
03:33:41.510 --> 03:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
know through the Great Vine there was
 
03:33:41.520 --> 03:33:42.670 align:start position:0%
know through the Great Vine there was
talk

03:33:42.670 --> 03:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
talk
 
03:33:44.950 --> 03:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
of uh providing a relief fund for
 
03:33:46.510 --> 03:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
Farmers that have been affected this
 
03:33:48.590 --> 03:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
year and I don't know exactly the status
 
03:33:51.110 --> 03:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
that is but the idea that the taxpayers
 
03:33:53.309 --> 03:33:53.319 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are going to subsidize
 
03:33:55.750 --> 03:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
destruction from the federal government
 
03:33:59.910 --> 03:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
through the weather manipulation is
 
03:34:02.950 --> 03:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
just it's absurd so that's why I brought
 
03:34:04.030 --> 03:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:34:07.510 --> 03:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
forward it's it's pretty wide ranging as
 
03:34:10.030 --> 03:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
you can tell and I don't even want to
 
03:34:12.070 --> 03:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
get too deep into into it but the basic
 
03:34:16.110 --> 03:34:16.120 align:start position:0%
point being the idea of trying to drop
 
03:34:19.870 --> 03:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
chemicals to stop global warming just
 
03:34:21.630 --> 03:34:21.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense we need to just
 
03:34:23.950 --> 03:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
step away let the environment do do what
 
03:34:25.830 --> 03:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
it needs to do and then figure out if
 
03:34:27.469 --> 03:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
there's any need for man-made
 
03:34:30.070 --> 03:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
manipulation of the weather so hopefully
 
03:34:31.710 --> 03:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
that makes some sense and if it doesn't
 
03:34:32.750 --> 03:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of people behind
 
03:34:35.110 --> 03:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
me that'll give more in detailed
 
03:34:37.349 --> 03:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
information I'll take questions if I can
 
03:34:40.229 --> 03:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
answer them if not I'm sure you'll find
 
03:34:41.870 --> 03:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
questions before the day is
 
03:34:45.110 --> 03:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
out okay thank you for answers
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
introducing this legislation questions
 
03:34:49.510 --> 03:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Corman
 
03:34:50.750 --> 03:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:34:52.349 --> 03:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
representative Gard for taking my
 
03:34:54.910 --> 03:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
question um I imagine that you've read
 
03:34:56.910 --> 03:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
the bill as is and that there's a fiscal
 
03:34:59.630 --> 03:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
note on the bill uh the Department of
 
03:35:03.269 --> 03:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services uh states that
 
03:35:04.870 --> 03:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
it's actually going to have quite a big
 
03:35:07.510 --> 03:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact on that department I'm
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could comment on
 
03:35:09.600 --> 03:35:13.469 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could comment on
that

03:35:13.469 --> 03:35:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:15.309 --> 03:35:15.319 align:start position:0%

03:35:24.990 --> 03:35:25.000 align:start position:0%

Harrington yeah thank you Mr chairman
 
03:35:31.469 --> 03:35:31.479 align:start position:0%
than be Tak my question on uh page one
 
03:35:37.070 --> 03:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
on getting down okay on line 21 it says
 
03:35:38.750 --> 03:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
talks about regulation by the state and
 
03:35:40.990 --> 03:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
it talks about all state CLA climate
 
03:35:43.309 --> 03:35:43.319 align:start position:0%
related appointees must be or have been
 
03:35:44.630 --> 03:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
administered the
 
03:35:47.229 --> 03:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
state oath of office and should fulfill
 
03:35:49.469 --> 03:35:49.479 align:start position:0%
the obligations there under to protect
 
03:35:51.750 --> 03:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
state and federal constitutions what
 
03:35:53.910 --> 03:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
exactly does that mean what's a what's a
 
03:35:56.070 --> 03:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
State climate related appoin ises that
 
03:35:59.950 --> 03:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
Define someplace and what oath that
 
03:36:01.790 --> 03:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
they're not taking would this require
 
03:36:04.349 --> 03:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
them to take I believe this was
 
03:36:07.429 --> 03:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
instituted to prohibit state employees
 
03:36:09.790 --> 03:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
from basically working hand inand with
 
03:36:11.070 --> 03:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
the federal government without letting
 
03:36:12.510 --> 03:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
us because right now on the books
 
03:36:14.349 --> 03:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to notify the people of
 
03:36:16.670 --> 03:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire when such geoengineering
 
03:36:18.950 --> 03:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
happens it hasn't happened there's been
 
03:36:20.790 --> 03:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
no notification and there's kind of a
 
03:36:22.750 --> 03:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
game where they they play the game of
 
03:36:24.950 --> 03:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
See No Evil Hear No Evil they weren't
 
03:36:27.070 --> 03:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
notified so they don't have to notify us
 
03:36:29.110 --> 03:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
and I think what this is attempting to
 
03:36:33.790 --> 03:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
get at is putting them under well the
 
03:36:36.229 --> 03:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
oath of fulfilling their duty to protect
 
03:36:37.950 --> 03:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
us from what the federal government's
 
03:36:39.790 --> 03:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
doing I mean I could be wrong if I'm
 
03:36:41.309 --> 03:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
wrong then I'm
 
03:36:43.070 --> 03:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's how I look at it but I
 
03:36:45.429 --> 03:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
followup followup okay you mentioned
 
03:36:47.750 --> 03:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
state employees but this talks about
 
03:36:49.189 --> 03:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
appointees so it wouldn't be state
 
03:36:50.630 --> 03:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
employees I assume this is someone with
 
03:36:52.309 --> 03:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
appointees meaning it was appointed by
 
03:36:54.150 --> 03:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
the governor confirmed by the executive
 
03:36:57.189 --> 03:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
counsel and they the ministered the oath
 
03:36:59.790 --> 03:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
of office I mean I was appointed and I
 
03:37:01.870 --> 03:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
had an oath of office it was it's done
 
03:37:03.750 --> 03:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
for everybody I'm not sure what this
 
03:37:05.229 --> 03:37:05.239 align:start position:0%
what is this doing that's different I
 
03:37:08.429 --> 03:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:10.870 --> 03:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
is I just thought it was put everybody
 
03:37:12.870 --> 03:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
on a Level Playing Field that everybody
 
03:37:15.030 --> 03:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
has take an out to defend the people of
 
03:37:16.229 --> 03:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and their rights and the
 
03:37:17.830 --> 03:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
environment and so forth that's what I
 
03:37:21.590 --> 03:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:25.790 --> 03:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
was representative Kaplan has a
 
03:37:27.910 --> 03:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:37:29.670 --> 03:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
you representative for coming today I
 
03:37:33.750 --> 03:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
have a question on um is line 14 in in
 
03:37:35.670 --> 03:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
the text it says uh I'll just read it
 
03:37:38.110 --> 03:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
due to necessity arising from federal
 
03:37:39.790 --> 03:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
stance and the potential needs for
 
03:37:41.429 --> 03:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
enemies for foreign and domestic to
 
03:37:44.269 --> 03:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
cause harm intentionally and it goes on
 
03:37:46.910 --> 03:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
so I was I was just curious are these
 
03:37:48.429 --> 03:37:48.439 align:start position:0%
enemies the foreign and domestic are
 
03:37:50.429 --> 03:37:50.439 align:start position:0%
they the enemies of the federal
 
03:37:52.429 --> 03:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
government or are they enemies of the
 
03:37:54.910 --> 03:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
state and is there a list somewhere that
 
03:37:57.309 --> 03:37:57.319 align:start position:0%
would define those the similar question
 
03:37:59.870 --> 03:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
is is this defined in statute anywhere
 
03:38:02.269 --> 03:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
or who who is going to determine who who
 
03:38:03.950 --> 03:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
these people are I would say anybody
 
03:38:05.510 --> 03:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's altering our environment without
 
03:38:07.429 --> 03:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
the people's permission I mean or the or
 
03:38:08.790 --> 03:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
the people's knowledge of what they're
 
03:38:10.349 --> 03:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
doing the idea of spraying a chemical
 
03:38:12.510 --> 03:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
into the air under the offices of making
 
03:38:15.150 --> 03:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
the the environment better it's just
 
03:38:16.910 --> 03:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
it's absurd I mean just I don't know how
 
03:38:19.150 --> 03:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
else to put it so I I don't know if that
 
03:38:22.510 --> 03:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:25.830 --> 03:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
but representative McGee has a question
 
03:38:27.229 --> 03:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:38:28.630 --> 03:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative Gard for taking my
 
03:38:30.910 --> 03:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
question um I had a bunch of stuff
 
03:38:33.110 --> 03:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
highlighted here but I wanted to talk a
 
03:38:35.950 --> 03:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
little bit about sort of the nuts and
 
03:38:38.189 --> 03:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
bolts of some of the points you have in
 
03:38:40.910 --> 03:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
here on page two sure let me put my
 
03:38:40.920 --> 03:38:41.870 align:start position:0%
here on page two sure let me put my
glasses

03:38:41.870 --> 03:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
glasses
 
03:38:46.349 --> 03:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
on um you you list that the commissioner
 
03:38:47.670 --> 03:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Environmental
 
03:38:50.550 --> 03:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
Services will immediately issue a cease
 
03:38:53.110 --> 03:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
and desist order upon the discovery of
 
03:38:55.469 --> 03:38:55.479 align:start position:0%
stratospheric aerosol injections cloud
 
03:38:57.990 --> 03:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
seeding weather modification or other
 
03:38:59.950 --> 03:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
atmospheric polluting activity including
 
03:39:02.469 --> 03:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
excessive electromagnet magnetic radio
 
03:39:05.830 --> 03:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
frequency microwave radiation emissions
 
03:39:07.830 --> 03:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
where an agency Department office
 
03:39:10.710 --> 03:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
program or member of the public uh um
 
03:39:13.189 --> 03:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
produces evidence to the department or
 
03:39:16.469 --> 03:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire County Sheriffs that
 
03:39:18.910 --> 03:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
the activity may be harmful or involves
 
03:39:21.910 --> 03:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
the releasing of polluting emissions my
 
03:39:24.630 --> 03:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
question is I did a little research into
 
03:39:27.389 --> 03:39:27.399 align:start position:0%
sort of how cloud seating or that type
 
03:39:29.229 --> 03:39:29.239 align:start position:0%
of thing has has happened in the United
 
03:39:31.790 --> 03:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
States so far and it's been the states
 
03:39:33.150 --> 03:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
that have been requesting it because
 
03:39:35.510 --> 03:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
they've been you know had lower amounts
 
03:39:38.309 --> 03:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
of rain or whatever so the so the wasn't
 
03:39:41.110 --> 03:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
the federal government imposing you know
 
03:39:43.750 --> 03:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
seating and this is saying that we're
 
03:39:47.349 --> 03:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
going to have um agency heads and local
 
03:39:49.950 --> 03:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
sheriffs be the people who will try and
 
03:39:51.750 --> 03:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
enforce this but how will they know
 
03:39:53.349 --> 03:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
who's seating if it's something that's
 
03:39:55.309 --> 03:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
happening that we're not already
 
03:39:57.469 --> 03:39:57.479 align:start position:0%
informed of I'm just trying to figure
 
03:40:00.550 --> 03:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
out how the bill would work indeed I
 
03:40:02.710 --> 03:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
would there's a delineation between
 
03:40:05.469 --> 03:40:05.479 align:start position:0%
cloud seating and then the solar
 
03:40:08.269 --> 03:40:08.279 align:start position:0%
radiation management nonsense stuff
 
03:40:09.790 --> 03:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
they're putting into thegu to block the
 
03:40:09.800 --> 03:40:10.950 align:start position:0%
they're putting into thegu to block the
Sun

03:40:10.950 --> 03:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
Sun
 
03:40:13.229 --> 03:40:13.239 align:start position:0%
so I think can I ask who is they though
 
03:40:14.750 --> 03:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
because you keep saying they and I who
 
03:40:16.550 --> 03:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
who is doing it is anyone doing it here
 
03:40:16.560 --> 03:40:19.870 align:start position:0%
who is doing it is anyone doing it here
federal

03:40:19.870 --> 03:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:21.910 --> 03:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
government if the state was doing it
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
then they're in violation of even more
 
03:40:24.110 --> 03:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
laws because they're supposed to be
 
03:40:26.830 --> 03:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
notifying us of as um representative
 
03:40:30.150 --> 03:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
Aaron's previous bill that was passed
 
03:40:30.160 --> 03:40:31.750 align:start position:0%
Aaron's previous bill that was passed
2020

03:40:31.750 --> 03:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
2020
 
03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
21 That was supposed to notify the
 
03:40:34.950 --> 03:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire when this was
 
03:40:36.630 --> 03:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
occurring we've never been notified so
 
03:40:38.269 --> 03:40:38.279 align:start position:0%
as far as State's concerned it isn't
 
03:40:40.830 --> 03:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
happening but we all know it's happening
 
03:40:42.309 --> 03:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
hence the turnout which is pretty
 
03:40:46.309 --> 03:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:50.030 --> 03:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
day additional questions representative
 
03:40:53.429 --> 03:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
PL has a question uh thank you chair and
 
03:40:55.229 --> 03:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question working
 
03:40:57.750 --> 03:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
off representative McGee's question is
 
03:41:00.670 --> 03:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
there any states that have looking into
 
03:41:03.150 --> 03:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
this similar type of legislation or has
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
it yes Rhode
 
03:41:09.030 --> 03:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
Island unfortunately my notes are a bit
 
03:41:09.040 --> 03:41:11.790 align:start position:0%
Island unfortunately my notes are a bit
messy

03:41:11.790 --> 03:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
messy
 
03:41:13.510 --> 03:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative poza has the list
 
03:41:14.630 --> 03:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
among other states R Island's
 
03:41:16.630 --> 03:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
introducing legislation right now
 
03:41:18.469 --> 03:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
Tennessee I believe there's a couple
 
03:41:21.710 --> 03:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
others as well Iowa and well trust me
 
03:41:23.070 --> 03:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of people here who have
 
03:41:25.910 --> 03:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
been studying this up to theth degree
 
03:41:27.630 --> 03:41:27.640 align:start position:0%
it's pretty impressive actually
 
03:41:30.070 --> 03:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
03:41:34.990 --> 03:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so I liken I mean
 
03:41:38.830 --> 03:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
nobody nobody is supports U pollution of
 
03:41:40.670 --> 03:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
any kind of course
 
03:41:43.630 --> 03:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
um and I Come From the Past pollution
 
03:41:46.189 --> 03:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
world of marac so I see a I see some
 
03:41:49.389 --> 03:41:49.399 align:start position:0%
similarities here on lines seven and
 
03:41:52.990 --> 03:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
eight on page one you talk about that it
 
03:41:55.429 --> 03:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
harms human health and the safety um the
 
03:41:57.309 --> 03:41:57.319 align:start position:0%

03:42:03.349 --> 03:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the problems we've had
 
03:42:09.389 --> 03:42:09.399 align:start position:0%
with p is proof of damage MH so um and
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
we've it's taken us seven years for to
 
03:42:14.990 --> 03:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
get proof of damage what are you relying
 
03:42:17.469 --> 03:42:17.479 align:start position:0%
on what statistics reports or studies
 
03:42:20.870 --> 03:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
are you relying on to prove all of these
 
03:42:23.309 --> 03:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
things are harmed for the actual in
 
03:42:24.910 --> 03:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
detailed statistics we're going to leave
 
03:42:26.630 --> 03:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
that to represent poten of but there's
 
03:42:29.070 --> 03:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
been studies on the snow pack and
 
03:42:30.870 --> 03:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
actually finding excessive amounts of
 
03:42:35.590 --> 03:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
aluminum barium barium stron stonum okay
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not so there's there's actually
 
03:42:40.830 --> 03:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
plenty of evidence believe or not
 
03:42:43.269 --> 03:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's just taking so long
 
03:42:45.590 --> 03:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
to get this off the ground because most
 
03:42:48.149 --> 03:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
people just dismiss it as craziness even
 
03:42:51.710 --> 03:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
though you can see it test for it so I
 
03:42:52.950 --> 03:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
know that's not exactly answering your
 
03:42:54.670 --> 03:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
question but trust me before this this
 
03:42:56.189 --> 03:42:56.199 align:start position:0%
hearing is over you will be fully
 
03:42:59.790 --> 03:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
satisfied I guarantee that I'm
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
out representative parshall has a
 
03:43:04.830 --> 03:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair thank you for
 
03:43:07.349 --> 03:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
being here today you just mentioned
 
03:43:11.229 --> 03:43:11.239 align:start position:0%
Barum barium was uh claimed in the 1990s
 
03:43:14.269 --> 03:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
to be included with Chemtrails in order
 
03:43:18.510 --> 03:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
to pacify our citizens uh it's a claim
 
03:43:22.229 --> 03:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
that I don't think is withstood uh any
 
03:43:24.550 --> 03:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
scientifically researched peer
 
03:43:24.560 --> 03:43:26.110 align:start position:0%
scientifically researched peer
peer-reviewed

03:43:26.110 --> 03:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed
 
03:43:28.389 --> 03:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
research however there is a lot of
 
03:43:31.630 --> 03:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
research on such things as uh CO2
 
03:43:33.990 --> 03:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
emissions and uh the effect of that on
 
03:43:36.750 --> 03:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
our environment such as what's going on
 
03:43:37.870 --> 03:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
in Hampton
 
03:43:40.469 --> 03:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
Beach um
 
03:43:43.110 --> 03:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
now while I am very concerned
 
03:43:47.309 --> 03:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
about the emissions that come from jet
 
03:43:51.790 --> 03:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
fuel I really find a lack of evidence
 
03:43:55.429 --> 03:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
towards all these allegations against
 
03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
things such as barium do you have any
 
03:43:59.990 --> 03:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
scientific research that you can point
 
03:44:00.000 --> 03:44:01.389 align:start position:0%
scientific research that you can point
to

03:44:01.389 --> 03:44:01.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:44:04.429 --> 03:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
and me personally no but my team yes we
 
03:44:05.750 --> 03:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
have plenty of evidence but getting back
 
03:44:07.309 --> 03:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
to the jet fuel it's not the jet fuel
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
this is not part of the concern at all
 
03:44:11.630 --> 03:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's the intentional spraying of
 
03:44:13.830 --> 03:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
chemicals while these airplanes are
 
03:44:16.349 --> 03:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
flying there's patents showing the
 
03:44:18.070 --> 03:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
actual spraying apparatus this is not
 
03:44:20.750 --> 03:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
just byproducts of the um burning of
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
fuel normal airplanes don't
 
03:44:26.149 --> 03:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
leave yes we'll we'll get to that and I
 
03:44:27.670 --> 03:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
will get back to you on the barium if
 
03:44:29.149 --> 03:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
somebody else doesn't answer that before
 
03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
the day is
 
03:44:34.910 --> 03:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
out representative Ms has a question uh
 
03:44:36.389 --> 03:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chair thank thank you
 
03:44:38.510 --> 03:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I I actually have
 
03:44:40.269 --> 03:44:40.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's like a two-part question that
 
03:44:42.590 --> 03:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
kind of talks follows on representative
 
03:44:44.670 --> 03:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
McGee's comment about you know the nuts
 
03:44:47.870 --> 03:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
and bolts of how this works sure um the
 
03:44:52.070 --> 03:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
the the the the first question is um I I
 
03:44:54.630 --> 03:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
found it interesting that the Bill calls
 
03:44:58.229 --> 03:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
out New Hampshire County Sheriffs as uh
 
03:45:00.750 --> 03:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
one of the entities to report these
 
03:45:03.710 --> 03:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
violations to and it was unclear as to
 
03:45:07.149 --> 03:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
why that wasn't um why the county
 
03:45:08.910 --> 03:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
sheriff's why not the New Hampshire
 
03:45:10.389 --> 03:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety
 
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
the county sheriffs are the highest law
 
03:45:14.110 --> 03:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer in the county
 
03:45:15.510 --> 03:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
they're directly responsible to the
 
03:45:17.710 --> 03:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
people obviously I mean that comes from
 
03:45:19.309 --> 03:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
the old English and so forth but the
 
03:45:20.910 --> 03:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
point being is they actually have a
 
03:45:22.349 --> 03:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
higher standing in the scheme of
 
03:45:24.510 --> 03:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
protecting the people than all these
 
03:45:27.030 --> 03:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
appointed entities that's why I chose
 
03:45:29.429 --> 03:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
the county sheriffs
 
03:45:29.439 --> 03:45:30.990 align:start position:0%
the county sheriffs
followup

03:45:30.990 --> 03:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
followup
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
followup and then I I guess the other
 
03:45:36.830 --> 03:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
question I had was um you know it talks
 
03:45:40.229 --> 03:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
about uh if if anyone
 
03:45:43.910 --> 03:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
um detects any of these um pollutants
 
03:45:45.990 --> 03:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
they they have an obligation to report
 
03:45:48.630 --> 03:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
them but you know is there a is there a
 
03:45:51.429 --> 03:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
standard that they need to follow I mean
 
03:45:54.590 --> 03:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
is the you know is and how do you me how
 
03:45:56.950 --> 03:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know how do we measure it you you
 
03:46:00.030 --> 03:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
know if you if you find one part per
 
03:46:03.149 --> 03:46:03.159 align:start position:0%
billion is that enough to report or is
 
03:46:05.710 --> 03:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
there going to be a higher standard you
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
know just can you shed some light on
 
03:46:08.600 --> 03:46:10.429 align:start position:0%
know just can you shed some light on
that

03:46:10.429 --> 03:46:10.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:46:12.950 --> 03:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
my my position would be to identify the
 
03:46:14.510 --> 03:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
aircraft then with flight trackers you
 
03:46:16.389 --> 03:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
can figure out who owns the plane and
 
03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
then at that point wait till it lands
 
03:46:21.429 --> 03:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
and you can do testing at that point or
 
03:46:22.790 --> 03:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
we can do other testing it's just
 
03:46:24.149 --> 03:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
obviously if there's a plane thousands
 
03:46:25.630 --> 03:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
of feet up how you going to say that
 
03:46:27.550 --> 03:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
even if you had a ground base test how
 
03:46:29.110 --> 03:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
you going to sa it's from that plane I
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
understand the complications but at the
 
03:46:32.349 --> 03:46:32.359 align:start position:0%
same time if these planes are doing this
 
03:46:34.429 --> 03:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
on the regular basis I don't think it
 
03:46:36.030 --> 03:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
would be that difficult to track said
 
03:46:37.910 --> 03:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
plane and wait till it lands or if need
 
03:46:41.110 --> 03:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
be force it to land
 
03:46:42.950 --> 03:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
03:46:44.349 --> 03:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:46:46.750 --> 03:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
again just following up on on that
 
03:46:49.510 --> 03:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
answer um a plane flying over New
 
03:46:51.910 --> 03:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not necessarily Landing in
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so how are you going to
 
03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
enforce checking on that
 
03:46:59.110 --> 03:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
plane plane flying over New Hampshire is
 
03:47:00.870 --> 03:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
VI is in our airspace and can be forced
 
03:47:05.389 --> 03:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:10.030 --> 03:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes follow up I mean just and
 
03:47:12.309 --> 03:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
and and what New Hampshire entity is
 
03:47:14.550 --> 03:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
going to force that plane to land we'll
 
03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
have to find out which one would be the
 
03:47:17.950 --> 03:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
most responsible I'm I'm assuming we
 
03:47:23.110 --> 03:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:25.389 --> 03:47:25.399 align:start position:0%
chose representative McGee has a
 
03:47:27.389 --> 03:47:27.399 align:start position:0%
question I I have a followup I'm just
 
03:47:29.510 --> 03:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
listening listening to everything um I
 
03:47:33.149 --> 03:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
actually I have a copy of the uh
 
03:47:35.950 --> 03:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
coverage of the prior bill that was
 
03:47:37.590 --> 03:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
passed saying that the measure requires
 
03:47:39.630 --> 03:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
that public input before experiments can
 
03:47:43.469 --> 03:47:43.479 align:start position:0%
be conducted and so my question goes to
 
03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
you're asserting that this is happening
 
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
right that you believe that this is
 
03:47:50.149 --> 03:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
happening yes and yet we have a law that
 
03:47:52.110 --> 03:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
says it can't happen without letting us
 
03:47:56.349 --> 03:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
know yes and so um I I I guess the
 
03:47:57.710 --> 03:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
question would be and I know you're
 
03:48:01.110 --> 03:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
going to say the people behind me but uh
 
03:48:04.429 --> 03:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
how we have evidence of this because my
 
03:48:07.110 --> 03:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the atmosphere is
 
03:48:09.630 --> 03:48:09.640 align:start position:0%
governed by the Environmental Protection
 
03:48:12.990 --> 03:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
agency and they have a Clean Air Act
 
03:48:15.149 --> 03:48:15.159 align:start position:0%
standard which has been updated like 28
 
03:48:16.830 --> 03:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
times since it was first put in place in
 
03:48:19.870 --> 03:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
1955 it doesn't include these types of
 
03:48:22.469 --> 03:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
pollutants at this point so that might
 
03:48:24.750 --> 03:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
be an appropriate place for some updates
 
03:48:28.510 --> 03:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
now but but what I uh as I was trying to
 
03:48:31.870 --> 03:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
kind of research the issue it appears
 
03:48:35.269 --> 03:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
that the federal government only
 
03:48:38.030 --> 03:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
authorizes state governments to
 
03:48:40.630 --> 03:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
undertake this type of proceeding if and
 
03:48:44.630 --> 03:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
when they feel they are in some kind of
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
danger of not having the rainfall or the
 
03:48:48.590 --> 03:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
snowfall that actually supports their
 
03:48:51.590 --> 03:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
economy so the decisions around whether
 
03:48:54.710 --> 03:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
someone is allowed to do this
 
03:48:58.990 --> 03:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
um appear to be made by the states and
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm just I'm just trying to figure
 
03:49:05.149 --> 03:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
out how you know something that none of
 
03:49:07.030 --> 03:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
those other entities that are involved
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
in it
 
03:49:11.349 --> 03:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
know I'm just trying to pull up the
 
03:49:13.670 --> 03:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
specific answer to your question which I
 
03:49:13.680 --> 03:49:15.149 align:start position:0%
specific answer to your question which I
actually

03:49:15.149 --> 03:49:15.159 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:49:17.630 --> 03:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
have so anyway
 
03:49:21.389 --> 03:49:21.399 align:start position:0%
states banned said spraying but then in
 
03:49:24.469 --> 03:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
1976 a law was passed by Congress to
 
03:49:26.710 --> 03:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
allow it at the federal level so what
 
03:49:29.149 --> 03:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
happened was basically they superseded
 
03:49:33.229 --> 03:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
the state's ability to regulate it until
 
03:49:34.550 --> 03:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
at this point which I think we should
 
03:49:36.550 --> 03:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
reassert our state sovereignty and say
 
03:49:38.750 --> 03:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
no we're done with that the point being
 
03:49:41.189 --> 03:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
is the cloud seeding I believe is two
 
03:49:43.750 --> 03:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
the two different topics going on so the
 
03:49:45.670 --> 03:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
geoengineering is kind of let's think
 
03:49:46.990 --> 03:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just now obviously I'm probably
 
03:49:48.670 --> 03:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
gonna be told that I'm wrong but it's
 
03:49:50.670 --> 03:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
the blocking of the Sun and other
 
03:49:52.309 --> 03:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
aspects of it but the cloud seating is
 
03:49:53.990 --> 03:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
simply increasing rainfall or snow or
 
03:49:57.189 --> 03:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be so the the federal
 
03:50:00.550 --> 03:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
government basically said this larger
 
03:50:03.790 --> 03:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
overarching mission is our primary
 
03:50:05.950 --> 03:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility and as far as cloud
 
03:50:08.349 --> 03:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
seating goes the state still because I I
 
03:50:09.790 --> 03:50:09.800 align:start position:0%
want to say it was out in Colorado I
 
03:50:11.189 --> 03:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
just reading about this last night they
 
03:50:13.429 --> 03:50:13.439 align:start position:0%
ended up stopping cloud seeding at one
 
03:50:15.030 --> 03:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
of the resorts just because the cost was
 
03:50:17.269 --> 03:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
too high so I mean this is still on
 
03:50:18.990 --> 03:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
going all over the place it's obviously
 
03:50:20.510 --> 03:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
when money gets tight they cut back on
 
03:50:23.790 --> 03:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
certain things but so I probably didn't
 
03:50:25.870 --> 03:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
answer your question but I'm hoping that
 
03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
someone behind me will fully answer that
 
03:50:29.429 --> 03:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
for you or represent poeno would
 
03:50:32.469 --> 03:50:32.479 align:start position:0%
probably be better for that thank you
 
03:50:34.630 --> 03:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
03:50:38.189 --> 03:50:38.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um on page three on
 
03:50:41.469 --> 03:50:41.479 align:start position:0%
lines 113 15 and 21 you reference the
 
03:50:44.309 --> 03:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services M
 
03:50:46.269 --> 03:50:46.279 align:start position:0%
however on line eight you reference the
 
03:50:48.070 --> 03:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental air
 
03:50:51.269 --> 03:50:51.279 align:start position:0%
Resources Division of
 
03:50:55.750 --> 03:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
compliance can you tell me
 
03:51:00.030 --> 03:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh why you called out that uh line eight
 
03:51:08.149 --> 03:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:08.159 --> 03:51:10.229 align:start position:0%
 
21

03:51:10.229 --> 03:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
21
 
03:51:12.870 --> 03:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's a typo yeah I'm not exactly
 
03:51:14.030 --> 03:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to answer that only
 
03:51:16.389 --> 03:51:16.399 align:start position:0%
because I know they do specific uh I'm
 
03:51:18.389 --> 03:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
going to just avoid that because I don't
 
03:51:19.630 --> 03:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
want to answer the wrong way you think
 
03:51:21.990 --> 03:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's a typo yes because the Department
 
03:51:24.349 --> 03:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services does have an
 
03:51:24.359 --> 03:51:25.229 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services does have an
air

03:51:25.229 --> 03:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
air
 
03:51:28.510 --> 03:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
resources no I understand that but why
 
03:51:30.750 --> 03:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
my my question is why does he reference
 
03:51:32.349 --> 03:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
on on line one the Department of
 
03:51:34.349 --> 03:51:34.359 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services line 13 the
 
03:51:35.950 --> 03:51:35.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
03:51:39.149 --> 03:51:39.159 align:start position:0%
line 15 and 21 same thing and yet online
 
03:51:41.189 --> 03:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
8 he references the Department of
 
03:51:43.830 --> 03:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
Environmental air Resources Division of
 
03:51:47.309 --> 03:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
compliance so why is that specific
 
03:51:49.910 --> 03:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
agency called out separate from the
 
03:51:52.389 --> 03:51:52.399 align:start position:0%
other ones my guess is that the air
 
03:51:55.110 --> 03:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
Resources Division is where you would
 
03:51:58.189 --> 03:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
register your uh that's where the
 
03:51:59.830 --> 03:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
evidence will be submitted right
 
03:52:00.990 --> 03:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
directly to them they're the ones that
 
03:52:03.189 --> 03:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
actually do fine particulate matter
 
03:52:05.269 --> 03:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
analysis I contacted them before putting
 
03:52:07.229 --> 03:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
the bill in and they basically said they
 
03:52:08.389 --> 03:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
are not testing for the certain
 
03:52:10.189 --> 03:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
chemicals that I asked so we have
 
03:52:12.950 --> 03:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
somebody from Dees who will be testified
 
03:52:16.870 --> 03:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions we
 
03:52:20.910 --> 03:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
want to thank you representative for
 
03:52:22.750 --> 03:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
introducing this legislation and next
 
03:52:25.590 --> 03:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
I'll call on representative Kelly
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:38.040 --> 03:52:53.269 align:start position:0%
 
19

03:52:53.269 --> 03:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:55.550 --> 03:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you committee
 
03:52:57.229 --> 03:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
for hearing my
 
03:53:00.510 --> 03:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
testimony so I'm I'm speaking on this
 
03:53:03.110 --> 03:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
specifically on the um underneath
 
03:53:05.349 --> 03:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
especially with being uh a member of
 
03:53:09.030 --> 03:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture on pollution
 
03:53:11.710 --> 03:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
so the toxicity of geoengineering
 
03:53:14.830 --> 03:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
geoengineering agents is well documented
 
03:53:17.229 --> 03:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
in scientific literature so there might
 
03:53:18.309 --> 03:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
be many people that are on this
 
03:53:20.229 --> 03:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
committee that are not familiar with it
 
03:53:22.030 --> 03:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
um there's many people that are New
 
03:53:24.630 --> 03:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens that have no idea
 
03:53:26.870 --> 03:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
what is happening what is happening not
 
03:53:29.950 --> 03:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
just in the state but AC but literally
 
03:53:31.910 --> 03:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh across the country and the entire
 
03:53:33.990 --> 03:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
planet so geoengineering is the
 
03:53:35.670 --> 03:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
intentional manipulation of course of
 
03:53:37.790 --> 03:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
the weather it's changing the Earth's
 
03:53:40.469 --> 03:53:40.479 align:start position:0%
atmosphere and ining the environment Geo
 
03:53:42.189 --> 03:53:42.199 align:start position:0%
engineering has been going on for
 
03:53:44.750 --> 03:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
decades and I have found early documents
 
03:53:47.750 --> 03:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
that date back a century on this the New
 
03:53:50.469 --> 03:53:50.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens never gave consent to
 
03:53:53.030 --> 03:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
manipulated man-made weather occurrences
 
03:53:55.950 --> 03:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
part one article one all men are born
 
03:53:58.110 --> 03:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
equally free and independent therefore
 
03:54:00.149 --> 03:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
all government of right originates from
 
03:54:03.990 --> 03:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
the people and is founded in in consent
 
03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
and instituted for the general good this
 
03:54:07.710 --> 03:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
is not for the general
 
03:54:11.990 --> 03:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
good uh part one article 8 all power
 
03:54:13.870 --> 03:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
residing origin in and being derived
 
03:54:15.510 --> 03:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
from the people all magistrates and
 
03:54:16.790 --> 03:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
officers of the government are
 
03:54:18.870 --> 03:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
substitutes and agents and all times
 
03:54:21.710 --> 03:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
accountable to them government therefore
 
03:54:24.269 --> 03:54:24.279 align:start position:0%
should be open accessible accountable
 
03:54:26.670 --> 03:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
and responsive to that end the Public's
 
03:54:28.950 --> 03:54:28.960 align:start position:0%

03:54:31.269 --> 03:54:31.279 align:start position:0%

12 nor the inhabitant of the state
 
03:54:43.149 --> 03:54:43.159 align:start position:0%

03:54:44.870 --> 03:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
those to which they or their
 
03:54:48.309 --> 03:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
representative body have given
 
03:54:51.269 --> 03:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
consent such Reckless interventions and
 
03:54:53.349 --> 03:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
injury are in our infringement on our
 
03:54:55.990 --> 03:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
rights and our extremely damaging to our
 
03:54:58.110 --> 03:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
life in Liberty in New Hampshire on this
 
03:55:01.309 --> 03:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
planet that's part one article one so
 
03:55:03.309 --> 03:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
founded in consent instituted for the
 
03:55:05.710 --> 03:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
general good so I want you to please
 
03:55:07.630 --> 03:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
support this effort to one protect our
 
03:55:09.189 --> 03:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
environment natural resource versus
 
03:55:11.550 --> 03:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
wildlife and most importantly the health
 
03:55:13.070 --> 03:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
safety and well-being of the people of
 
03:55:15.189 --> 03:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the protection of the
 
03:55:16.790 --> 03:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
environment and
 
03:55:19.269 --> 03:55:19.279 align:start position:0%
concerns um and concerns public health
 
03:55:21.469 --> 03:55:21.479 align:start position:0%
and safety must be of the highest
 
03:55:24.110 --> 03:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
priority not the agency that is supposed
 
03:55:28.149 --> 03:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
to be monitoring this stating we have no
 
03:55:30.030 --> 03:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge of this occurring in New
 
03:55:32.670 --> 03:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I put the packet that had
 
03:55:36.149 --> 03:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
Title One um chapter 12f the weather
 
03:55:39.510 --> 03:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
modification experimentation on E on in
 
03:55:41.750 --> 03:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
front of each of you and I'll get back
 
03:55:41.760 --> 03:55:43.030 align:start position:0%
front of each of you and I'll get back
to

03:55:43.030 --> 03:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:55:45.710 --> 03:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
that like I said we have no knowledge of
 
03:55:47.309 --> 03:55:47.319 align:start position:0%
this occurring in New Hampshire we all
 
03:55:49.309 --> 03:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
need to work together to pass the clean
 
03:55:51.870 --> 03:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
atmosphere preservation act this is not
 
03:55:54.269 --> 03:55:54.279 align:start position:0%
a political matter it's a people matter
 
03:55:57.110 --> 03:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
we must do more than prevent pollution
 
03:55:59.630 --> 03:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
especially which it's intentional
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
pollution regulations are essential to
 
03:56:04.710 --> 03:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
protect and preserve everyone's right to
 
03:56:07.110 --> 03:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
breathe clean air to breathe clean
 
03:56:08.870 --> 03:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
healthy air and prohibit harmful

and there's several others but those are
 
03:56:47.950 --> 03:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to cover today is

aluminum oxide also pose health risks
 
03:57:42.030 --> 03:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
and then the potential toxicity the full

scale of health health effects of
 
03:57:45.910 --> 03:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
graphine oxide are not yet fully
 
03:57:48.950 --> 03:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
understood but its toxicity has already
 
03:57:51.550 --> 03:57:51.560 align:start position:0%
been established and of course climate
 
03:57:54.910 --> 03:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
change contributing to uh global warming
 
03:57:57.269 --> 03:57:57.279 align:start position:0%
so certain aerosols including sulfur
 
03:57:59.389 --> 03:57:59.399 align:start position:0%
dioxide can contribute to the global
 
03:58:01.910 --> 03:58:01.920 align:start position:0%

03:58:06.110 --> 03:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
cooling effect it does not address the
 
03:58:08.950 --> 03:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
root cause of climate change and has of
 
03:58:12.110 --> 03:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
course unintended consequences ethical
 
03:58:14.630 --> 03:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
considerations Public Safety and Health
 
03:58:15.870 --> 03:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
governments have an ethical
 
03:58:18.510 --> 03:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to prioritize public
 
03:58:20.630 --> 03:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
health and safety releasing aerosols
 
03:58:22.670 --> 03:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
with health and environmental risks and
 
03:58:24.590 --> 03:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
consequences are considered a breach of
 
03:58:27.070 --> 03:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
their fiduciary responsibilities and
 
03:58:29.229 --> 03:58:29.239 align:start position:0%
then the most important thing I'd have
 
03:58:30.950 --> 03:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
to say and the ethical is informed
 
03:58:33.429 --> 03:58:33.439 align:start position:0%
consent there are ethical concerns about
 
03:58:35.830 --> 03:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
the releases of substances like graphine
 
03:58:38.590 --> 03:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
Oxide without fully understanding and
 
03:58:39.950 --> 03:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
everything else that I've mentioned
 
03:58:42.990 --> 03:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
their potential impacts informed consent
 
03:58:45.550 --> 03:58:45.560 align:start position:0%
of the public is crucial and matters
 
03:58:47.269 --> 03:58:47.279 align:start position:0%
that could affect health and
 
03:58:50.070 --> 03:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
well-being long-term side effects we
 
03:58:52.870 --> 03:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
have no idea what these could um what
 
03:58:55.870 --> 03:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
could equate to for our of course not
 
03:58:57.830 --> 03:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
just our New Hampshire citizens but our
 
03:59:00.950 --> 03:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
entire country and the planet so there
 
03:59:02.750 --> 03:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
are alternatives and sustainable
 
03:59:04.830 --> 03:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
practices that can be used to promote
 
03:59:07.309 --> 03:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
cleaner Technologies of course um with
 
03:59:09.269 --> 03:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
what they are trying to do in regards
 
03:59:11.349 --> 03:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
with their geoengineering that has not
 
03:59:13.469 --> 03:59:13.479 align:start position:0%
even been looked at um investment in
 
03:59:15.670 --> 03:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
Green Solutions um the government can
 
03:59:17.389 --> 03:59:17.399 align:start position:0%
invest in research and development
 
03:59:20.149 --> 03:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
certain alterio Sol um alternative
 
03:59:22.950 --> 03:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
solutions that do not pose significant
 
03:59:25.070 --> 03:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
environmental heal rks and then there's
 
03:59:27.269 --> 03:59:27.279 align:start position:0%
that red you know the Regulatory
 
03:59:29.990 --> 03:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
Compliance so we have to adhere to
 
03:59:32.389 --> 03:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
environmental regulations and right now
 
03:59:34.389 --> 03:59:34.399 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's basically like the Wild
 
03:59:37.189 --> 03:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
Wild West out there there's none of them
 
03:59:38.990 --> 03:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
and if
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of you guys want um data I will
 
03:59:44.710 --> 03:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
provide you with links to everything
 
03:59:47.349 --> 03:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
that's right on uh right on DC right
 
03:59:49.750 --> 03:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
from the White House's um their own
 
03:59:51.510 --> 03:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
studies and everything all the way up
 
03:59:54.229 --> 03:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
until 2024 I will give you everything
 
03:59:56.110 --> 03:59:56.120 align:start position:0%
that you need it's right there at your
 
03:59:58.630 --> 03:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
taking this is not hidden it's right in
 
04:00:00.990 --> 04:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
front of our it's right in front of our
 
04:00:03.550 --> 04:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
eyes so the government of course is
 
04:00:05.870 --> 04:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
fully responsible for acting ethically
 
04:00:08.590 --> 04:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
by considering the potential risks and
 
04:00:11.030 --> 04:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
consequences of these substances so I
 
04:00:12.189 --> 04:00:12.199 align:start position:0%
just want to
 
04:00:15.110 --> 04:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
speak try to go quickly let's just talk
 
04:00:17.630 --> 04:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
about sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid
 
04:00:19.710 --> 04:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
okay so we already know it's a
 
04:00:21.790 --> 04:00:21.800 align:start position:0%
respiratory irritant so SO2 is a known
 
04:00:23.790 --> 04:00:23.800 align:start position:0%
respiratory irritant exposure to high
 
04:00:25.510 --> 04:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
concentrations can cause resp
 
04:00:28.349 --> 04:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
respiratory problems in humans acid
 
04:00:30.189 --> 04:00:30.199 align:start position:0%
formation the release of so SO2
 
04:00:32.349 --> 04:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
contributes to acid formation which have
 
04:00:34.070 --> 04:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
of course detrimental effects on
 
04:00:36.309 --> 04:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
ecosystems so I don't know if everybody
 
04:00:38.950 --> 04:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
knows this but if we just go to dhh yes
 
04:00:40.790 --> 04:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
so right now New Hampshire has some of
 
04:00:43.149 --> 04:00:43.159 align:start position:0%
the highest rates of asthma across the
 
04:00:47.429 --> 04:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
country with with between 2014 in 2016
 
04:00:50.229 --> 04:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
the CDC estimates putting it as putting
 
04:00:52.550 --> 04:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
it as the state with the highest adult
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
asthma pre prevalence asthma affects
 
04:00:59.830 --> 04:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
13.2% of New Hampshire adults 7.2 7.21%
 
04:01:01.670 --> 04:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire children accounting for
 
04:01:04.670 --> 04:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
over 4,000 emergency room visits and
 
04:01:09.750 --> 04:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
over 177 million in direct medical costs
 
04:01:13.389 --> 04:01:13.399 align:start position:0%
graphine oxide this is taken from a
 
04:01:16.429 --> 04:01:16.439 align:start position:0%
study the band gap of graphine oxide can
 
04:01:18.870 --> 04:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
be easily tuned and therefore it has a a
 
04:01:21.830 --> 04:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
wide range of photocatalyic applications
 
04:01:24.269 --> 04:01:24.279 align:start position:0%
as well uh the degradation of organic
 
04:01:27.309 --> 04:01:27.319 align:start position:0%

04:01:40.550 --> 04:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
and high high density um as it is highly
 
04:01:42.469 --> 04:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
functional with oxygen containing
 
04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
functional groups well let's get to the
 
04:01:47.349 --> 04:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
the meat and bat the meat and potatoes
 
04:01:50.229 --> 04:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
it has been observed that the super
 
04:01:54.189 --> 04:01:54.199 align:start position:0%

04:01:57.349 --> 04:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
species R levels gradually increase over
 
04:02:00.469 --> 04:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
a period after gra graphine oxide is
 
04:02:03.189 --> 04:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
introduced into the biological systems
 
04:02:06.309 --> 04:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
hence specific concentrations are toxic
 
04:02:08.830 --> 04:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
for species like earthworms for our
 
04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and making our our our crops
 
04:02:15.269 --> 04:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
grow as well as for Aquatics zebra fish
 
04:02:17.349 --> 04:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
Etc aluminum
 
04:02:20.990 --> 04:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
oxide this is the big one so inhalation
 
04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
of fine aluminum oxide particles May
 
04:02:25.189 --> 04:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
pose health risks particularly to the
 
04:02:27.750 --> 04:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
respiratory system I talked about asthma
 
04:02:30.269 --> 04:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
before so a possible geoengineering
 
04:02:32.750 --> 04:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
method to mitigate the global warming
 
04:02:34.389 --> 04:02:34.399 align:start position:0%
aspect of climate change is the
 
04:02:36.110 --> 04:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
injection of aerosols into the lowest
 
04:02:38.830 --> 04:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
Stratosphere close closely Mimi in the
 
04:02:41.269 --> 04:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
way a large volcanic eruptions cool the
 
04:02:43.189 --> 04:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
climate the method is called solar
 
04:02:46.389 --> 04:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
radiation manage management SRM scheme
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
or simply solar gen geoengineering so s
 
04:02:53.070 --> 04:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
SRM has been suggested to be affordable
 
04:02:54.790 --> 04:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
and have high Effectiveness compared
 
04:02:56.950 --> 04:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
with other like geoengineering schemes
 
04:02:58.710 --> 04:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
that have been suggested to mitigate
 
04:03:01.429 --> 04:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
global warming so while sulfate aerosols
 
04:03:03.469 --> 04:03:03.479 align:start position:0%
are the most studied it has been
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
recently shown that aerosols with other
 
04:03:08.269 --> 04:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
compositions aluminum oxide alumina
 
04:03:10.030 --> 04:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
Diamond could be used to dramatically
 
04:03:12.309 --> 04:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of light scatter
 
04:03:15.429 --> 04:03:15.439 align:start position:0%
achieved on a per Mass basis aluminum
 
04:03:18.510 --> 04:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
particles found after the alumni aerosol
 
04:03:21.030 --> 04:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
injection are more efficient scatterers
 
04:03:24.309 --> 04:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
and may have less severe techn
 
04:03:26.750 --> 04:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
technology specific risks than
 
04:03:28.830 --> 04:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
sulfates thus they're expected to be
 
04:03:30.670 --> 04:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
more efficient per unit mass for
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
geoengine applications we conclude that
 
04:03:35.349 --> 04:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
there's strong evidence that aluminum
 
04:03:37.710 --> 04:03:37.720 align:start position:0%
can cause irritation following exposure
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
via inhalation or injection modest
 
04:03:42.590 --> 04:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
evidence of effects for Reproductive
 
04:03:46.070 --> 04:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
toxicity following oral exposure for
 
04:03:48.349 --> 04:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
neurological um toxicity following
 
04:03:50.389 --> 04:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
either oral or injection exposure and
 
04:03:52.710 --> 04:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
for bone toxicity following injection
 
04:03:57.110 --> 04:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
exposure all other effects um all other
 
04:03:58.830 --> 04:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
effects were judged to be supported by
 
04:04:00.830 --> 04:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
either limited evidence or no clear
 
04:04:03.510 --> 04:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
evidence at all exposure assessment dose
 
04:04:04.870 --> 04:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
response assessment risk
 
04:04:06.630 --> 04:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
characterization were conducted for
 
04:04:08.990 --> 04:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
those those effects which evidence was
 
04:04:11.790 --> 04:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
judged to be either strong or modest the
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
remainder of the section describes our
 
04:04:16.229 --> 04:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
findings for the general population at
 
04:04:19.429 --> 04:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
special risk um occupationally exposed
 
04:04:21.670 --> 04:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
population aluminum has also been
 
04:04:26.750 --> 04:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
regarded as um posing a health hazard if
 
04:04:29.269 --> 04:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
um specifically when we're talking about
 
04:04:32.030 --> 04:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
dementia and in Alzheimer's I have some
 
04:04:34.389 --> 04:04:34.399 align:start position:0%
hand outes if you'd like so the
 
04:04:35.830 --> 04:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
condition is most common form of
 
04:04:38.830 --> 04:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
dementia it may contribute to 60 70% of
 
04:04:41.910 --> 04:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
the cases of course of Alzheimer in 2015
 
04:04:44.110 --> 04:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
dementia affected 47 million people
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
worldwide or roughly 5% of the world's
 
04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
elderly population a figure predicted to
 
04:04:54.309 --> 04:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
increase to 75 million in 2030 and 132
 
04:04:57.309 --> 04:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
Million by 2050 recent reviews estimate
 
04:05:00.469 --> 04:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
that each near each year nearly 9.9
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
million people develop dementia globally
 
04:05:06.189 --> 04:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
this figure translates into one new case
 
04:05:09.429 --> 04:05:09.439 align:start position:0%
every 3 seconds so even prolonged
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
exposure to low levels of aluminum leads
 
04:05:14.950 --> 04:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
to changes associated with brain aging
 
04:05:16.429 --> 04:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
and neurod
 
04:05:18.910 --> 04:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
degeneration and as you know it's all
 
04:05:21.830 --> 04:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
about the load so how long you're
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
experien to that how many it it's just
 
04:05:28.710 --> 04:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
for for example for sickness I interrupt
 
04:05:30.830 --> 04:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
you for just a second you requested 10
 
04:05:34.349 --> 04:05:34.359 align:start position:0%
minutes from now going on 15 okay and
 
04:05:36.389 --> 04:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
you're wandering away from the subject
 
04:05:39.269 --> 04:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
of the bill so I'd like you to wrap it
 
04:05:41.429 --> 04:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
up if you could please okay but this is
 
04:05:43.389 --> 04:05:43.399 align:start position:0%
the subject of the bill because this is
 
04:05:48.469 --> 04:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
what is in um this is what is in these
 
04:05:53.349 --> 04:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
planes so I gave you uh first a copy of
 
04:05:55.469 --> 04:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
what the current weather modification
 
04:05:57.630 --> 04:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
experimentation is I gave you just a
 
04:06:01.149 --> 04:06:01.159 align:start position:0%
little handout um this here is the
 
04:06:04.510 --> 04:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
platform NOAA twin otter payload that is
 
04:06:07.469 --> 04:06:07.479 align:start position:0%
exactly what the the aircraft looks like
 
04:06:09.990 --> 04:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
that is filled with these chemicals and
 
04:06:14.469 --> 04:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
it tells you um it has all of the um it
 
04:06:15.870 --> 04:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
has it tells you exactly what gets
 
04:06:18.710 --> 04:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
loaded in there so
 
04:06:21.189 --> 04:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
um and then I also just so you could
 
04:06:23.710 --> 04:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of History because the
 
04:06:25.870 --> 04:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
the document that is from the White
 
04:06:28.750 --> 04:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
House that they just put out is um is a
 
04:06:31.670 --> 04:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
huge document it's I think it's over 70
 
04:06:33.710 --> 04:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
pages so I wasn't going to do that on my
 
04:06:36.550 --> 04:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
printer at home and do 20 copies but
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
this was from agriculture defense
 
04:06:41.469 --> 04:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
Coalition press release so this was in
 
04:06:45.229 --> 04:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
2010 and this shows you what um what
 
04:06:48.429 --> 04:06:48.439 align:start position:0%
they were spraying in the in the um
 
04:06:49.469 --> 04:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
through their
 
04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
SRM and what was happening then NASA
 
04:06:54.750 --> 04:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
research you know studies show that
 
04:06:56.950 --> 04:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
increasingly persistent jet contrails
 
04:06:59.030 --> 04:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
may turn into manmade clouds D trapping
 
04:07:00.910 --> 04:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
warmth in the atmosphere there's a whole
 
04:07:03.389 --> 04:07:03.399 align:start position:0%
slew of things here that talk about this
 
04:07:05.590 --> 04:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
and a and a lot and I have tons and tons
 
04:07:08.990 --> 04:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
of links that I can give you
 
04:07:11.790 --> 04:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
um the other piece that I wanted to talk
 
04:07:13.429 --> 04:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
about real quick and then I'll I'll wrap
 
04:07:18.189 --> 04:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
up is so the current 12f document let's
 
04:07:20.670 --> 04:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
be clear here under one any department
 
04:07:23.750 --> 04:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
or agency of the state may with the
 
04:07:25.590 --> 04:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
approval of the government and Council
 
04:07:27.550 --> 04:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
and within limits of appropriated funds
 
04:07:29.790 --> 04:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
or by means of gifts donations or grants
 
04:07:32.429 --> 04:07:32.439 align:start position:0%
engage in undertake experimentation in
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
the techniques and methods for weather
 
04:07:37.149 --> 04:07:37.159 align:start position:0%
modification and may cooperate therein
 
04:07:39.030 --> 04:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
with the Federal ederal government with
 
04:07:41.910 --> 04:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
authorized agencies of other states and
 
04:07:43.870 --> 04:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
with interested persons and
 
04:07:47.389 --> 04:07:47.399 align:start position:0%
organizations so now if we go to at
 
04:07:49.349 --> 04:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
least two months prior to the
 
04:07:51.710 --> 04:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
presentation approval of Engagement or
 
04:07:53.149 --> 04:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
experimentation in techniques and
 
04:07:54.990 --> 04:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
methods for weather modification the
 
04:07:56.750 --> 04:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
department or agency of the state
 
04:07:58.830 --> 04:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
participating in such engagement or
 
04:08:00.630 --> 04:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
experimentation shall do the following
 
04:08:02.469 --> 04:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
place a public notice and all of that
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
the federal government is included in
 
04:08:07.830 --> 04:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
this and just to speak to the question
 
04:08:09.670 --> 04:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
in regards with
 
04:08:13.149 --> 04:08:13.159 align:start position:0%
um the cost of this or there shouldn't
 
04:08:14.910 --> 04:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
have to be any cost this would be a
 
04:08:17.830 --> 04:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
request so for example this committee
 
04:08:22.109 --> 04:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
could um could put in a uh request or in
 
04:08:24.830 --> 04:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
a sense a legislative uh you know uh
 
04:08:27.550 --> 04:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
demand to get for the last three years
 
04:08:32.349 --> 04:08:32.359 align:start position:0%
since 2021 how many uh Federal planes
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
how much geoengineering has taken place
 
04:08:36.349 --> 04:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I think that's where we
 
04:08:38.990 --> 04:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
start to see exact L what has what has
 
04:08:41.349 --> 04:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
gone on now that should have happened
 
04:08:44.070 --> 04:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
from Dees that's a simple ask that
 
04:08:46.229 --> 04:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't need a a new salary a new
 
04:08:47.910 --> 04:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
position or anything like that it's
 
04:08:51.269 --> 04:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
about what for us to know what is going
 
04:08:54.030 --> 04:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
on I'm I'm in Rochester I'm very close
 
04:08:57.189 --> 04:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
to peas Air Force Base I can tell you
 
04:08:59.590 --> 04:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
that I have a neighbor across the street
 
04:09:02.550 --> 04:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh she's 80 years old she she has never
 
04:09:05.109 --> 04:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
seen this kind of weather that we've had
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
um ever and and in planes flying and
 
04:09:12.309 --> 04:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
Cloud patterns and all of that kind of
 
04:09:15.870 --> 04:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
stuff and uh and she actually um she's a
 
04:09:19.229 --> 04:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
graduate of unh and um and is very very
 
04:09:22.030 --> 04:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
inen with the environment so listening
 
04:09:24.070 --> 04:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
to people and this is a huge thing I've
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
had the same thing contact from all over
 
04:09:29.590 --> 04:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
legislators from um other states I've
 
04:09:31.070 --> 04:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
talked to people in New Jersey
 
04:09:34.590 --> 04:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania Florida uh Colorado New
 
04:09:39.109 --> 04:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
Mexico so this is a huge issue and uh we
 
04:09:40.790 --> 04:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
need to know what's going on here and
 
04:09:45.030 --> 04:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:47.590 --> 04:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you questions from the
 
04:09:49.790 --> 04:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
committee representative Kaplan has a
 
04:09:51.750 --> 04:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:09:53.109 --> 04:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
you representative for coming in and
 
04:09:56.189 --> 04:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
presenting your bill you know I I also
 
04:09:57.550 --> 04:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
have a lot of concerns about the
 
04:09:59.309 --> 04:09:59.319 align:start position:0%
environment I agree the weather is is
 
04:10:01.309 --> 04:10:01.319 align:start position:0%
changing the climate is changing and and
 
04:10:03.189 --> 04:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
we know what the causes of that are it's
 
04:10:05.870 --> 04:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
not contrails and the planes uh so you
 
04:10:08.349 --> 04:10:08.359 align:start position:0%
know there's climate change um
 
04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm concerned with some of the
 
04:10:11.229 --> 04:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
effects of the pollutants that you
 
04:10:13.550 --> 04:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned aluminum lead in the air all
 
04:10:15.309 --> 04:10:15.319 align:start position:0%
these things have tremendous detrimental
 
04:10:18.750 --> 04:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
effects on on on us on on on the public
 
04:10:20.070 --> 04:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
and we ought to be doing something about
 
04:10:23.109 --> 04:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
it with this bill you you claim that you
 
04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
you know that this is happening yet you
 
04:10:26.710 --> 04:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
say you want to find out what's going on
 
04:10:28.429 --> 04:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
I agree I would like to find out what's
 
04:10:30.510 --> 04:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
going on if this is happening I I think
 
04:10:32.389 --> 04:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
we need to find out but I'm not sure
 
04:10:33.790 --> 04:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
it's happening and I'm not sure you're
 
04:10:35.910 --> 04:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
sure either so I think really what you
 
04:10:37.550 --> 04:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
want to do is have maybe a study
 
04:10:40.389 --> 04:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
commission where the state requests this
 
04:10:42.349 --> 04:10:42.359 align:start position:0%
information and puts together some some
 
04:10:44.790 --> 04:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
of the data that is lacking and and we
 
04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
go from there but this this none of that
 
04:10:50.070 --> 04:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
is in this bill so my question to you is
 
04:10:51.510 --> 04:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
why haven't you formed a study
 
04:10:53.189 --> 04:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
commission before coming forward with
 
04:10:53.199 --> 04:10:55.349 align:start position:0%
commission before coming forward with
this

04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill well I jumped on this bill as a
 
04:11:00.149 --> 04:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor I know it's an issue I do
 
04:11:01.950 --> 04:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
know that it's happening I'm not talking
 
04:11:04.109 --> 04:11:04.119 align:start position:0%
about contrails I'm talking about
 
04:11:06.510 --> 04:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
man-made geoengineering that has been
 
04:11:08.910 --> 04:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
going on for decades to in like
 
04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
literally a century so I'll provide
 
04:11:13.990 --> 04:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
every single document that will come
 
04:11:15.389 --> 04:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
from the federal government that will
 
04:11:17.590 --> 04:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
prove to you that they are doing it they
 
04:11:19.710 --> 04:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
tell you that they're doing it that
 
04:11:22.429 --> 04:11:22.439 align:start position:0%
there's no secret here so it's that
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
that's to me I didn't even feel like I
 
04:11:26.349 --> 04:11:26.359 align:start position:0%
had to be on this committee and argue
 
04:11:29.590 --> 04:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
that that's a given it's happening there
 
04:11:31.229 --> 04:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
there's Partnerships right now with
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
United Nations in doing it it it's
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
happening so um but if that me a study
 
04:11:41.670 --> 04:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
committee is is fantastic but I also
 
04:11:44.550 --> 04:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
want to make sure um I want to know what
 
04:11:46.630 --> 04:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
has been happening in New Hampshire
 
04:11:49.109 --> 04:11:49.119 align:start position:0%
since 2021 when reporting was supposed
 
04:11:51.510 --> 04:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
to be done if that if that a study
 
04:11:53.590 --> 04:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
committee will help with that wonderful
 
04:11:54.910 --> 04:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
but there was a study committee that
 
04:11:57.309 --> 04:11:57.319 align:start position:0%
took place with had everything to do
 
04:11:59.910 --> 04:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
with my committee with cob bacteria and
 
04:12:01.469 --> 04:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
I think the state spent
 
04:12:04.229 --> 04:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
$30,000 and we've done nothing with that
 
04:12:07.630 --> 04:12:07.640 align:start position:0%
and our Lakes continue to be uh poison
 
04:12:10.189 --> 04:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
by fertilizer phosphorus and some other
 
04:12:11.910 --> 04:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
entities that people don't realize are
 
04:12:15.950 --> 04:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
running off into the Lakes so this is
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
a this is one of the biggest issues that
 
04:12:22.109 --> 04:12:22.119 align:start position:0%
we're facing right now and um there's a
 
04:12:24.109 --> 04:12:24.119 align:start position:0%
I would I'm going to provides tons of
 
04:12:26.269 --> 04:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
information for you the folks over in
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
California in regards with wildfires and
 
04:12:31.030 --> 04:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
stuff like that um that that are
 
04:12:33.870 --> 04:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
happening that that are that we know are
 
04:12:35.189 --> 04:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
happening from some of these things that
 
04:12:38.309 --> 04:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
are taking place um
 
04:12:40.189 --> 04:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll get every bit of testimony
 
04:12:42.229 --> 04:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
every bit of of reports that you need
 
04:12:43.590 --> 04:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
from the federal government that will
 
04:12:45.790 --> 04:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
tell you what is happening but I for
 
04:12:47.910 --> 04:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
specifically to New Hampshire I think we
 
04:12:50.109 --> 04:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
have to I think we have to find out and
 
04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
if a study committee is where we go then
 
04:12:55.349 --> 04:12:55.359 align:start position:0%
great representative licki has a
 
04:12:56.790 --> 04:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:12:59.790 --> 04:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative uh
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
I just looked up you mentioned graphine
 
04:13:04.469 --> 04:13:04.479 align:start position:0%
oxides I just looked up graphine and
 
04:13:06.830 --> 04:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
according to what I saw it says it's
 
04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
just a form of carbon why would the
 
04:13:11.670 --> 04:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
oxide of graphine be any different from
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
the oxide of anything from charcoal to
 
04:13:19.710 --> 04:13:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:23.710 --> 04:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
Co so I am not a scientist I read you
 
04:13:25.990 --> 04:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
scientific documents I will be happy to
 
04:13:28.269 --> 04:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
provide all of that to you just so you
 
04:13:31.670 --> 04:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
can understand where the when you're
 
04:13:33.109 --> 04:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
putting things in the environment and
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
how they impact yeah I can't I'm not
 
04:13:37.429 --> 04:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
going to be able to to answer answer
 
04:13:39.309 --> 04:13:39.319 align:start position:0%
that question I'm just not I will be
 
04:13:40.750 --> 04:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
able to provide you an answer to that
 
04:13:43.750 --> 04:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
question though representative Noel has
 
04:13:46.389 --> 04:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:13:50.229 --> 04:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh I assume that
 
04:13:52.910 --> 04:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
the uh pilots and the crew that are
 
04:13:54.590 --> 04:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
putting together these chemicals have
 
04:13:57.510 --> 04:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
looked at the msdss for graphine oxide
 
04:13:59.710 --> 04:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
or the aluminum oxide or all of the
 
04:14:02.149 --> 04:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
other components and they've made the
 
04:14:04.910 --> 04:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
determinations as to what the lethal
 
04:14:07.389 --> 04:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
dose is and what the correct
 
04:14:09.149 --> 04:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
concentration needs to be when they go
 
04:14:11.830 --> 04:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
to distribute these chemicals otherwise
 
04:14:15.670 --> 04:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
they would be in violation of Osha
 
04:14:20.149 --> 04:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
law um the the federal study that I will
 
04:14:23.349 --> 04:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
give you that just came out in in 2024
 
04:14:26.429 --> 04:14:26.439 align:start position:0%
will um be very will show you that there
 
04:14:29.630 --> 04:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
is no monitoring uh there we don't know
 
04:14:32.349 --> 04:14:32.359 align:start position:0%
any of that information at all um we
 
04:14:34.269 --> 04:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
don't know who these Pilots are or any
 
04:14:37.309 --> 04:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
of that so this is its think of it like
 
04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know think of it like its own you
 
04:14:41.550 --> 04:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
know space force NASA or whatever
 
04:14:43.389 --> 04:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
there're there there's an own entity
 
04:14:46.189 --> 04:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
here that's running that's separate from
 
04:14:48.429 --> 04:14:48.439 align:start position:0%
all regulation there's no government or
 
04:14:50.870 --> 04:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation in any of this right
 
04:14:53.830 --> 04:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
now at all that is the reason why we're
 
04:14:55.510 --> 04:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
like I said earlier it's like the Wild
 
04:14:58.630 --> 04:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
Wild West so there is
 
04:15:02.070 --> 04:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
nothing representative Ms has a question
 
04:15:04.990 --> 04:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chairman
 
04:15:08.990 --> 04:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
um um I I was going to follow up on on
 
04:15:11.469 --> 04:15:11.479 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan's comments but I I
 
04:15:13.550 --> 04:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
I I I do need to ask you a question in
 
04:15:16.710 --> 04:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
light of what you just said um so what
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
evidence is there that these flights
 
04:15:21.790 --> 04:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
have actually taken place do we have any
 
04:15:25.950 --> 04:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
record of takeoffs Landings flight
 
04:15:30.269 --> 04:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:32.870 --> 04:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there is a gentleman that
 
04:15:35.950 --> 04:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
is um he's a former pilot uh former
 
04:15:38.550 --> 04:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
military that has been tracking planes
 
04:15:40.750 --> 04:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
out of P's Air Force Base he couldn't be
 
04:15:44.309 --> 04:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
here today to testify so so all flight
 
04:15:48.229 --> 04:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
records of course we you know um this is
 
04:15:51.229 --> 04:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
coming from a I'm not a pilot so I don't
 
04:15:53.790 --> 04:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
know the terms so that he there's
 
04:15:55.550 --> 04:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
different tracking mechanisms that you
 
04:15:57.269 --> 04:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
can see where flight records are and
 
04:16:00.750 --> 04:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
where where planes are going so um some
 
04:16:03.910 --> 04:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
some planes of course are on you know
 
04:16:06.309 --> 04:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
they're just normal you know uh take off
 
04:16:08.469 --> 04:16:08.479 align:start position:0%
whatever where they're going that then
 
04:16:10.750 --> 04:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
there's a military entity of course to
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
pece but those are on a different
 
04:16:15.790 --> 04:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
tracking mechanism as well um for all
 
04:16:18.630 --> 04:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
the recorded flights so there are
 
04:16:22.349 --> 04:16:22.359 align:start position:0%
flights that he that he has documented
 
04:16:25.750 --> 04:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
that there is no documentation at all so
 
04:16:28.030 --> 04:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
they're not showing takeoff Landings or
 
04:16:31.030 --> 04:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
any of that kind of stuff cuz he's there
 
04:16:33.229 --> 04:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
he's been following this for a very long
 
04:16:35.630 --> 04:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
time but there's many other entities all
 
04:16:37.469 --> 04:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
throughout the United States that I will
 
04:16:41.670 --> 04:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
connect you with followup followup so I
 
04:16:45.510 --> 04:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
I I live in in Hampton I live um a half
 
04:16:48.990 --> 04:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
mile from the water um I see the planes
 
04:16:52.109 --> 04:16:52.119 align:start position:0%
taking off and landing at peas all the
 
04:16:55.910 --> 04:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
time um I have never seen a plane like
 
04:17:00.750 --> 04:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
you have described in this handout um so
 
04:17:02.389 --> 04:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
I I mean are you suggesting that the
 
04:17:04.429 --> 04:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
flights are originating at
 
04:17:07.229 --> 04:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
peace I'm not I'm not suggesting in that
 
04:17:09.229 --> 04:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
they're originating from peas I'm
 
04:17:10.710 --> 04:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
suggesting that they could be
 
04:17:13.510 --> 04:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
originating from anywhere but there's
 
04:17:17.870 --> 04:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
been multiple flights where you can see
 
04:17:17.880 --> 04:17:18.990 align:start position:0%
been multiple flights where you can see
[Music]

04:17:18.990 --> 04:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:17:22.149 --> 04:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
um you can see literally emissions
 
04:17:26.950 --> 04:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
coming out of a plane that are that stay
 
04:17:29.149 --> 04:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
it's not a contrail or anything like
 
04:17:31.550 --> 04:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
that and I don't like to use you know
 
04:17:33.910 --> 04:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to use the that dirty word
 
04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
that people like to talk about cuz then
 
04:17:37.870 --> 04:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
we're all like you know oh with this is
 
04:17:40.510 --> 04:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
some big conspiracy because it is not
 
04:17:42.630 --> 04:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
and it's been going on for a long time
 
04:17:45.389 --> 04:17:45.399 align:start position:0%
why would Mexico why why would why would
 
04:17:48.189 --> 04:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
Mexico ban this why is the United States
 
04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
the only one that um basically said hey
 
04:17:52.469 --> 04:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be part of that out
 
04:17:55.469 --> 04:17:55.479 align:start position:0%
of 190 other countries that are that are
 
04:17:57.189 --> 04:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
have basically said no we're not going
 
04:17:59.389 --> 04:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
to pollute with Geo you know we're not
 
04:18:02.429 --> 04:18:02.439 align:start position:0%
going to experiment on um you know on
 
04:18:05.870 --> 04:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
our citizens so this stuff is happening
 
04:18:07.309 --> 04:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
it's been happening
 
04:18:09.670 --> 04:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
there's I see planes all of the time
 
04:18:12.389 --> 04:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
that are not just regular planes
 
04:18:16.469 --> 04:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
so this is literally
 
04:18:22.830 --> 04:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:27.349 --> 04:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
taken from our government so this is the
 
04:18:31.910 --> 04:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
um the NOAA chemical Sciences laboratory
 
04:18:33.670 --> 04:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
they are part of the US Department of
 
04:18:35.670 --> 04:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
Commerce they are also part of the
 
04:18:38.309 --> 04:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
national ocean Oceanic Atmospheric
 
04:18:41.229 --> 04:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
Administration and part of the ocean
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
office of Oceanic and Atmospheric
 
04:18:48.189 --> 04:18:48.199 align:start position:0%
research Department n o AA o a r so this
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
isn't I'm not pulling these you know
 
04:18:54.510 --> 04:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
up to follow up on representative mun's
 
04:18:59.510 --> 04:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
question how do you tell the difference
 
04:19:02.070 --> 04:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
between a regular plane and a plane
 
04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
that's doing whatever it is you're
 
04:19:08.229 --> 04:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
suggesting that they're doing
 
04:19:10.590 --> 04:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
you can see it
 
04:19:12.710 --> 04:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
from you can see it right from the
 
04:19:15.309 --> 04:19:15.319 align:start position:0%
ground so I mean I have of course
 
04:19:17.870 --> 04:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
pictures on my phone they
 
04:19:21.550 --> 04:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
leave they leave a white they do leave a
 
04:19:24.830 --> 04:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
white Trail for a long period of time
 
04:19:28.469 --> 04:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
and then it dissipates into like
 
04:19:30.349 --> 04:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's like ribbon kind of
 
04:19:33.550 --> 04:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
looking clouds that are it's really hard
 
04:19:37.349 --> 04:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
to describe but there's um
 
04:19:39.030 --> 04:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
there's a document
 
04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
here that I gave you guys that's what it
 
04:19:42.000 --> 04:19:43.950 align:start position:0%
here that I gave you guys that's what it
looks

04:19:43.950 --> 04:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
looks
 
04:19:47.510 --> 04:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
like okay thank you representative
 
04:19:49.950 --> 04:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:19:51.750 --> 04:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Penza for taking my
 
04:19:54.990 --> 04:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
question um I think we we are not
 
04:19:56.790 --> 04:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
environment nag right so we don't get a
 
04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
lot of the bills that are about um
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
pollution and additives in water and
 
04:20:04.030 --> 04:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
land I think you guys see most of those
 
04:20:07.830 --> 04:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
and we do definitely have um um an issue
 
04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
with thank you um we definitely do have
 
04:20:13.790 --> 04:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
an issue with contaminants in our
 
04:20:15.750 --> 04:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
environment now that we're all concerned
 
04:20:17.910 --> 04:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
about and they're they're kind of hard
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
to um to localize in some ways because I
 
04:20:23.469 --> 04:20:23.479 align:start position:0%
don't know if any of you have ever heard
 
04:20:25.229 --> 04:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
that New England is called the tailpipe
 
04:20:28.229 --> 04:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
of the US because the wind flows from
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
west to east and we get a lot of
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
contaminants from o from other areas
 
04:20:35.790 --> 04:20:35.800 align:start position:0%
Industrial Waste in the midwest it it
 
04:20:39.710 --> 04:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
flows this way so my question is you're
 
04:20:42.790 --> 04:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
you're naming contaminants but I am
 
04:20:44.630 --> 04:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
wondering how you know that these
 
04:20:46.030 --> 04:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
contaminants are
 
04:20:48.070 --> 04:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
related first of all how do you know
 
04:20:50.429 --> 04:20:50.439 align:start position:0%
that these contaminants are here and
 
04:20:52.030 --> 04:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
second how do you know these
 
04:20:54.710 --> 04:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
contaminants are related to
 
04:20:57.070 --> 04:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
geoengineering versus some other way of
 
04:20:58.870 --> 04:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
getting here which I would I would
 
04:21:00.630 --> 04:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
imagine our Dees person might be able to
 
04:21:03.309 --> 04:21:03.319 align:start position:0%
speak to that too how they get here
 
04:21:05.389 --> 04:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
right CU you're making you're trying to
 
04:21:07.109 --> 04:21:07.119 align:start position:0%
make the connection and say this is what
 
04:21:09.070 --> 04:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
it's from and this is how we know so I
 
04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:17.349 --> 04:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
know so I I've got eyes to see right so
 
04:21:21.349 --> 04:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
I've seen this uh um I've seen this on
 
04:21:24.109 --> 04:21:24.119 align:start position:0%
my own uh I know I have constituents
 
04:21:25.990 --> 04:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
that have contacted the Department of
 
04:21:29.790 --> 04:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and received
 
04:21:34.750 --> 04:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
um no answer uh their answer
 
04:21:44.830 --> 04:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:46.710 --> 04:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
Dees has no knowledge of anyone spraying
 
04:21:48.070 --> 04:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
chemicals into the atmosphere from
 
04:21:50.070 --> 04:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
aircraft other than exhaust gases from
 
04:21:52.030 --> 04:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
combustion and fuel aircraft Dees
 
04:21:53.710 --> 04:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
understands that some limited testing or
 
04:21:55.429 --> 04:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
research may have occurred in this field
 
04:21:56.910 --> 04:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
but we have no specific information
 
04:21:58.710 --> 04:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
related to such testing and are not
 
04:22:00.630 --> 04:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
aware of it currently occurring in New
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire elsewhere Dees is aware of the
 
04:22:05.349 --> 04:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements contained in RSA
 
04:22:08.710 --> 04:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
12f so they're not looking into it
 
04:22:10.710 --> 04:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
there's been con there's been multiple
 
04:22:12.710 --> 04:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
constituents that have called on this
 
04:22:15.149 --> 04:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
that have asked for it to be looked at
 
04:22:18.910 --> 04:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
um so all I know is that I have eyes to
 
04:22:22.349 --> 04:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
see I know what they look
 
04:22:26.830 --> 04:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
like that is what from the NOAA it tells
 
04:22:29.229 --> 04:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
you what's get gets
 
04:22:31.990 --> 04:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
released um into the
 
04:22:35.389 --> 04:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
atmosphere and that's really when you're
 
04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's in a sense it's playing God is
 
04:22:39.950 --> 04:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
really what it comes down to we are
 
04:22:42.030 --> 04:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
we're messing with things that we
 
04:22:44.349 --> 04:22:44.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be messing with and it affects
 
04:22:46.309 --> 04:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
everything from ecosystems to People's
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
Health to all of that but if we can find
 
04:22:52.149 --> 04:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
out that information then we need to
 
04:22:53.590 --> 04:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
find that
 
04:22:57.830 --> 04:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
out followup so I I I agree with you you
 
04:22:59.510 --> 04:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
know it's a little scary to think that
 
04:23:00.910 --> 04:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
people are messing with things they may
 
04:23:03.349 --> 04:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
not understand the outcomes of I I agree
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
with that I have that same feeling about
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
geoengineering I just just think that um
 
04:23:10.269 --> 04:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
we're trying to prove a negative here
 
04:23:12.590 --> 04:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
right we're saying that our Department
 
04:23:14.429 --> 04:23:14.439 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services doesn't know
 
04:23:17.229 --> 04:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
about any activity and they should
 
04:23:19.269 --> 04:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
because we know there is activity but
 
04:23:21.389 --> 04:23:21.399 align:start position:0%
you haven't provided any real evidence
 
04:23:24.550 --> 04:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
of activity and so I'm I'm just trying
 
04:23:27.710 --> 04:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
to figure out if you understand how the
 
04:23:29.630 --> 04:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
system is supposed to work right the any
 
04:23:31.750 --> 04:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
geoengineering that's happening in the
 
04:23:34.590 --> 04:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
country is authorized at the federal
 
04:23:38.030 --> 04:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
level and requested at the state level
 
04:23:42.750 --> 04:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
which means we have to assume that that
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
the proposal that you're putting out
 
04:23:46.229 --> 04:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
here is that someone other than those
 
04:23:50.189 --> 04:23:50.199 align:start position:0%
entities somebody is deciding to seed
 
04:23:52.309 --> 04:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
the clouds over New Hampshire without
 
04:23:55.590 --> 04:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
anybody's knowledge and I
 
04:23:58.710 --> 04:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
don't I just I don't know how you how
 
04:24:02.149 --> 04:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
you um how you want us to to go along
 
04:24:05.309 --> 04:24:05.319 align:start position:0%
with you on that because somebody has to
 
04:24:06.830 --> 04:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
be behind it
 
04:24:09.950 --> 04:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
and so is it is it the federal
 
04:24:11.389 --> 04:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
government is that what you're trying to
 
04:24:12.950 --> 04:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
say that the federal government is doing
 
04:24:15.870 --> 04:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
this to us correct without our input
 
04:24:18.550 --> 04:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
correct that's just clear as day well
 
04:24:21.149 --> 04:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
the record of all of the Geo seeding
 
04:24:22.870 --> 04:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's happened in the United States has
 
04:24:24.750 --> 04:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
been at the states requests that had
 
04:24:26.109 --> 04:24:26.119 align:start position:0%
that Geo seating though whether it's
 
04:24:28.870 --> 04:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
California or Colorado the the places
 
04:24:31.229 --> 04:24:31.239 align:start position:0%
that are listed as the places that have
 
04:24:34.109 --> 04:24:34.119 align:start position:0%
had it from the research that I've done
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
remember uh representative we're not
 
04:24:37.389 --> 04:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
here to well I'm just trying to get an
 
04:24:39.550 --> 04:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
idea because I don't know how the
 
04:24:41.790 --> 04:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
process you're talking about where a
 
04:24:43.550 --> 04:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
state and that's you're talking about
 
04:24:45.189 --> 04:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
something separate so you're talking
 
04:24:48.309 --> 04:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
about if a state is requiring or asking
 
04:24:50.469 --> 04:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
for the federal government to do some to
 
04:24:53.070 --> 04:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
you do some cloud seating in regards
 
04:24:55.109 --> 04:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
with like the that's happened in
 
04:24:57.189 --> 04:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
multiple places that have been affected
 
04:25:00.790 --> 04:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
by drought um and all of that that's not
 
04:25:02.429 --> 04:25:02.439 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about so we're
 
04:25:04.389 --> 04:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
talking about literally the federal
 
04:25:07.870 --> 04:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
government that is doing full-blown
 
04:25:11.189 --> 04:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
experimentation and it it's all I'll
 
04:25:13.389 --> 04:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
send you every single document that you
 
04:25:15.950 --> 04:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
need it's all right out there for you to
 
04:25:18.910 --> 04:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
find and in my press release that I did
 
04:25:23.830 --> 04:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
that has been picked up everywhere
 
04:25:27.750 --> 04:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
um right on www white house.gov
 
04:25:30.389 --> 04:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
congressionally mandated report on solar
 
04:25:32.630 --> 04:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
radiation modification that's what this
 
04:25:35.070 --> 04:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
bill is it talks about
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
SRM so it it's a huge report and then
 
04:25:42.910 --> 04:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
I'll give you studies from um actually
 
04:25:45.510 --> 04:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth has a study uh UNH is is
 
04:25:46.790 --> 04:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
familiar with this I've already talked
 
04:25:49.229 --> 04:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
to my folks over there um I have someone
 
04:25:52.830 --> 04:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
that's willing to pay um after rainfall
 
04:25:54.790 --> 04:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
when when we have witnesses that are
 
04:25:58.790 --> 04:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of the um a lot of the um a
 
04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
lot of the cloud formations that we're
 
04:26:04.710 --> 04:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
talking about from from aircraft um to
 
04:26:07.149 --> 04:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
test the ground and to test the rainfall
 
04:26:09.349 --> 04:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
afterwards um so there's a lot of people
 
04:26:11.790 --> 04:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
that are very very interested in this
 
04:26:13.229 --> 04:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
however we can prove this to make it
 
04:26:14.990 --> 04:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
happen but when it comes this is the
 
04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
federal government this is there's no um
 
04:26:22.349 --> 04:26:22.359 align:start position:0%
there's no regul there's nothing's being
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:30.790 --> 04:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
experiments representative clog has a
 
04:26:32.710 --> 04:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair and thank you
 
04:26:36.109 --> 04:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm a segue
 
04:26:40.109 --> 04:26:40.119 align:start position:0%
off of um other reps
 
04:26:42.750 --> 04:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
now we see the I can see the weather
 
04:26:44.070 --> 04:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
changing in my
 
04:26:46.990 --> 04:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
lifetime in this committee I hear it's
 
04:26:50.750 --> 04:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
CO2 methane we've taken sulfur out of
 
04:26:52.750 --> 04:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
our diesel fuels we taken the
 
04:26:55.070 --> 04:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
particulates out of our diesel fuels and
 
04:26:57.950 --> 04:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
what I heard today from testimony that
 
04:27:01.469 --> 04:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
we're putting sulfur dioxide U sulfur
 
04:27:08.349 --> 04:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
dioxide um and um graphite carbon in the
 
04:27:08.359 --> 04:27:10.109 align:start position:0%
dioxide um and um graphite carbon in the
air

04:27:10.109 --> 04:27:10.119 align:start position:0%
air
 
04:27:13.469 --> 04:27:13.479 align:start position:0%
now these same things are attributing to
 
04:27:18.030 --> 04:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
health of this um our citizens
 
04:27:22.950 --> 04:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
so U my question is if there is a study
 
04:27:26.590 --> 04:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
committee you can provide documents it's
 
04:27:30.510 --> 04:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
a question can you provide documents to
 
04:27:30.520 --> 04:27:32.109 align:start position:0%
a question can you provide documents to
to

04:27:32.109 --> 04:27:32.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:27:36.149 --> 04:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
prove or identify where this is
 
04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
happening 100% thank
 
04:27:43.189 --> 04:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
you representative Thomas has a
 
04:27:47.349 --> 04:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um so this
 
04:27:49.750 --> 04:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
bill starts off in the air literally
 
04:27:51.189 --> 04:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
you're talking about planes and
 
04:27:53.149 --> 04:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
everything and then on page four it kind
 
04:27:54.630 --> 04:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
of brings it down to the Earth where
 
04:27:57.109 --> 04:27:57.119 align:start position:0%
you're talking about facilities and
 
04:27:58.590 --> 04:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
towers and
 
04:28:01.870 --> 04:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
antennas um and you're saying that any
 
04:28:04.349 --> 04:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
facility Tower or antenna that uses
 
04:28:08.269 --> 04:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
ionizing radiation has um concentrated
 
04:28:08.279 --> 04:28:09.429 align:start position:0%
ionizing radiation has um concentrated
energy

04:28:09.429 --> 04:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
energy
 
04:28:13.030 --> 04:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
Transmissions exposure to um people
 
04:28:15.630 --> 04:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
could an unintended consequence of this
 
04:28:17.670 --> 04:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
bill be that it could shut down seab
 
04:28:21.710 --> 04:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
Brook power stations and 5G
 
04:28:25.050 --> 04:28:25.060 align:start position:0%
Towers no so if
 
04:28:25.060 --> 04:28:26.670 align:start position:0%
Towers no so if
[Music]

04:28:26.670 --> 04:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:28:30.229 --> 04:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
um let me grab my I have a piece of
 
04:28:32.950 --> 04:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:35.790 --> 04:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
that and of course if there needs to be
 
04:28:38.790 --> 04:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this bill in any way cuz
 
04:28:41.710 --> 04:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
you know it's not perfect this is a um
 
04:28:45.070 --> 04:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a monster of a bill and uh
 
04:28:48.790 --> 04:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of experts help with this
 
04:28:53.309 --> 04:28:53.319 align:start position:0%
um with its crafting of course um but
 
04:28:54.990 --> 04:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
that it could be changed you know if
 
04:28:58.469 --> 04:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
there was any um if there was any
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
question to that where am I looking a
 
04:29:03.870 --> 04:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
followup there it is
 
04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
oh do you have an answer for that
 
04:29:09.870 --> 04:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
yes so I just wanted to um I wanted to
 
04:29:13.309 --> 04:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
let you know that uh folks that are all
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
about 5G 6G and all of that kind of
 
04:29:17.590 --> 04:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
stuff uh which is you know the huge
 
04:29:19.590 --> 04:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
corporations like Verizon and all of
 
04:29:22.269 --> 04:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
that they all support this because this
 
04:29:24.750 --> 04:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
has interference with their frequencies
 
04:29:27.229 --> 04:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
so what's happening when you are when
 
04:29:31.070 --> 04:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
you are um making it like a you know
 
04:29:33.750 --> 04:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
aluminum dust or heavy metals that are
 
04:29:35.429 --> 04:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
that are taking place in the atmosphere
 
04:29:39.870 --> 04:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
it also affects that so um so Verizon
 
04:29:44.030 --> 04:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
18t so I'm going to actually quote them
 
04:29:47.109 --> 04:29:47.119 align:start position:0%
um so even Verizon and AT&amp;T Define what
 
04:29:49.149 --> 04:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
we're referring to as pollution to be
 
04:29:50.950 --> 04:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
clear we're not you know worried about
 
04:29:53.389 --> 04:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
snow making cannons like we talked about
 
04:29:56.030 --> 04:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
um we're looking to regulate airplane
 
04:29:59.030 --> 04:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
engine emissions have you know some and
 
04:30:00.750 --> 04:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
we're not looking that's the other thing
 
04:30:03.070 --> 04:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
is like everybody keeps talking about
 
04:30:05.070 --> 04:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
domestic airplane engine emissions and
 
04:30:07.910 --> 04:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's all disingenuous but for
 
04:30:10.830 --> 04:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
Verizon and AT&amp;T to come out and say
 
04:30:12.750 --> 04:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
that what that this is pollution and it
 
04:30:16.109 --> 04:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
affects their operations is quite big
 
04:30:16.119 --> 04:30:17.349 align:start position:0%
affects their operations is quite big
okay

04:30:17.349 --> 04:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:30:21.469 --> 04:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
followup followup thank you um and on uh
 
04:30:24.910 --> 04:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
page four line 26 you reference ecode
 
04:30:28.070 --> 04:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
360 can you tell me what that is please
 
04:30:32.510 --> 04:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
no probably can't page what uh it's page
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
four of the bill line
 
04:30:38.750 --> 04:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
26 uh any vibration noise I think that's
 
04:30:42.389 --> 04:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
laser not CER is CER okay uh Sonic
 
04:30:44.429 --> 04:30:44.439 align:start position:0%
weapon or other physical agent exceeding
 
04:30:46.149 --> 04:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
other official limits guidelines or
 
04:30:48.510 --> 04:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
standards such as eode
 
04:30:52.109 --> 04:30:52.119 align:start position:0%
360 is what is
 
04:30:54.790 --> 04:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry what line are you on I
 
04:31:00.389 --> 04:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:02.950 --> 04:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
okay so I can provide some of that
 
04:31:07.710 --> 04:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
information to you um I EOD 360 is is uh
 
04:31:10.030 --> 04:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
that is a um that's a federal uh that's
 
04:31:13.030 --> 04:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
a federal code so as you know that um
 
04:31:16.710 --> 04:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
our government has been um developing
 
04:31:19.590 --> 04:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
and has for decades as well Sonic
 
04:31:22.149 --> 04:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
weapons laser weapons all of that from
 
04:31:23.910 --> 04:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
from satellites and everything that you
 
04:31:27.630 --> 04:31:27.640 align:start position:0%
could possibly imagine so um there's a
 
04:31:29.790 --> 04:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
there's a document and I'm pretty sure
 
04:31:34.710 --> 04:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
it's from UCLA that talks about how and
 
04:31:37.630 --> 04:31:37.640 align:start position:0%
this is getting very very technical um
 
04:31:41.269 --> 04:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
where the satellite um coordinates of
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
course with what's being released in the
 
04:31:46.910 --> 04:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
atmosphere and that actually creates um
 
04:31:48.910 --> 04:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
that actually creates in a sense kind of
 
04:31:52.269 --> 04:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
a a weapon um an environmental weapon
 
04:31:55.349 --> 04:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
that is taking place too but this is way
 
04:31:56.830 --> 04:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
beyond my pay
 
04:31:58.710 --> 04:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
grade I went to school for
 
04:32:00.550 --> 04:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
communications I'm a minor in public
 
04:32:03.469 --> 04:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
relations I'm hope I'm doing thank you
 
04:32:06.630 --> 04:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
so um repres pres ative Corman has a
 
04:32:08.309 --> 04:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:32:10.590 --> 04:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm I'm a bit
 
04:32:12.990 --> 04:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about U some of the assertions
 
04:32:15.790 --> 04:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
that you've made so you you said that um
 
04:32:19.750 --> 04:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid are
 
04:32:22.229 --> 04:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
causes of asthma you stated a link
 
04:32:25.109 --> 04:32:25.119 align:start position:0%
between aluminum and Alzheimer's and I
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
took the liberty of going to the
 
04:32:28.910 --> 04:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
American Lung Association site and they
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
have a page called what causes asthma
 
04:32:33.790 --> 04:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
and it lists family history allergies
 
04:32:35.830 --> 04:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
viral respiratory infections
 
04:32:38.510 --> 04:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
occupational exposur smoking air
 
04:32:40.429 --> 04:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
pollution and under air pollution it
 
04:32:42.429 --> 04:32:42.439 align:start position:0%
says exposure to the main component of
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
smog ozone raises the risk for asthma
 
04:32:48.349 --> 04:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
and then obesity nowhere is anything
 
04:32:51.030 --> 04:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
about sulfur dioxide mentioned you just
 
04:32:52.469 --> 04:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned it you just mentioned air
 
04:32:53.750 --> 04:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
pollution that's what we're talking
 
04:32:55.790 --> 04:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
about well you mentioned Su dioxide
 
04:32:57.630 --> 04:32:57.640 align:start position:0%
specifically and there's nothing here
 
04:33:01.830 --> 04:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
about that and then um I'm also at the
 
04:33:04.750 --> 04:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh Lung Association site uh not excuse
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
me Alzheimer's Association site and uh
 
04:33:10.709 --> 04:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
it says and I'm quoting no convincing
 
04:33:12.590 --> 04:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
relationship between aluminum and the
 
04:33:14.349 --> 04:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
development of Alzheimer's disease has
 
04:33:17.869 --> 04:33:17.879 align:start position:0%
been established so um are you are you
 
04:33:20.990 --> 04:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
contradicting these authoritative sites

I'm going to give you literally other
 
04:33:33.029 --> 04:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
medical sites that state um High toxic
 
04:33:36.230 --> 04:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
levels of aluminum in that load how it
 
04:33:38.510 --> 04:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
does have those types of effects which
 
04:33:40.590 --> 04:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
it has other types of effects as well
 
04:33:42.670 --> 04:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
aluminum has effects with respiratory as
 
04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
well aluminum has effects with um with
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
neurological different components
 
04:33:51.910 --> 04:33:51.920 align:start position:0%

you know what the uh leading cause of of
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
um second leading cause of lung cancer
 
04:34:02.949 --> 04:34:02.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:05.670 --> 04:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
country uh according to who in not ask
 
04:34:07.390 --> 04:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
the questions of you not the other way

around okay so it's raidon so and and
 
04:34:12.189 --> 04:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
actually that's why if you want to talk
 
04:34:13.750 --> 04:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
about cancer rates and all of that kind
 
04:34:15.551 --> 04:34:15.561 align:start position:0%
of stuff here in New Hampshire we have a
 
04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
huge problem and that's not just with
 
04:34:19.109 --> 04:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
radon in the water that's radon in the
 
04:34:23.189 --> 04:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
air so um yeah we I'm very familiar with
 
04:34:25.910 --> 04:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
um with those types of pollutants okay
 
04:34:27.709 --> 04:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
representative Penza I want to thank you
 
04:34:28.830 --> 04:34:28.840 align:start position:0%

legislation thank you Mr chair again
 
04:35:51.230 --> 04:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
Craig Wright I serve as the Director of
 
04:35:53.470 --> 04:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
the air division at the Department of
 
04:35:55.629 --> 04:35:55.639 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services a pleasure to be
 
04:35:55.639 --> 04:35:56.429 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services a pleasure to be
here

04:35:56.429 --> 04:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:35:59.869 --> 04:35:59.879 align:start position:0%
today um there's a lot in this bill um
 
04:36:03.109 --> 04:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
as you've heard already um I think if
 
04:36:04.390 --> 04:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
you read the fiscal note that the
 
04:36:07.269 --> 04:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
department wrote I think it's
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
clear is this better okay sorry um Dees
 
04:36:15.269 --> 04:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
does not have expertise knowledge or any
 
04:36:17.429 --> 04:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
other information regarding the subject
 
04:36:20.510 --> 04:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
topics of this bill nor do we have any
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
information regarding potential Health
 
04:36:25.189 --> 04:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
impacts or environmental
 
04:36:29.429 --> 04:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
impacts um Dees as noted in the fiscal
 
04:36:32.310 --> 04:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
note Dees does not have the staff
 
04:36:35.109 --> 04:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
resources to research monitor or for
 
04:36:37.869 --> 04:36:37.879 align:start position:0%
Force the provisions of this
 
04:36:40.349 --> 04:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
bill we would need to hire technical
 
04:36:42.590 --> 04:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
staff investigative staff and
 
04:36:42.600 --> 04:36:43.789 align:start position:0%
staff investigative staff and
enforcement

04:36:43.789 --> 04:36:43.799 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
04:36:46.949 --> 04:36:46.959 align:start position:0%
staff regardless of all that um and I
 
04:36:48.990 --> 04:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
think this is also noted in the fiscal
 
04:36:52.029 --> 04:36:52.039 align:start position:0%
note from the Department of Justice I
 
04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
would question whether um even with this
 
04:36:57.269 --> 04:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
bill uh the state would have
 
04:36:59.349 --> 04:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over things that may be
 
04:36:59.359 --> 04:37:00.830 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over things that may be
federally

04:37:00.830 --> 04:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
federally
 
04:37:00.840 --> 04:37:02.390 align:start position:0%
federally
regulated

04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
04:37:05.910 --> 04:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
um this type of work is not typical to
 
04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
the work that thees performs under our
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
air pollution control statutes RSA
 
04:37:14.189 --> 04:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
125c or the federal Clean Air Act under
 
04:37:16.670 --> 04:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
the federal Clean Air Act EPA sets
 
04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
health-based air quality standards it's
 
04:37:21.269 --> 04:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
the state's responsibility to monitor
 
04:37:23.189 --> 04:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
the equality with respect to those
 
04:37:25.189 --> 04:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
standards and if we don't meet those
 
04:37:27.070 --> 04:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
standards we need to develop plans
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
policies programs uh to ensure that the
 
04:37:32.470 --> 04:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
state meets those standards um we need
 
04:37:36.189 --> 04:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
to submit such plans to EPA for approval
 
04:37:38.750 --> 04:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
um also in reading the bill I would
 
04:37:40.269 --> 04:37:40.279 align:start position:0%
think that there's a things that we
 
04:37:41.910 --> 04:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
would need to consult with the AG's
 
04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
office on regarding the enforcement
 
04:37:46.629 --> 04:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
Provisions including issu and cease and
 
04:37:49.869 --> 04:37:49.879 align:start position:0%
desist orders um there are emergency air
 
04:37:52.230 --> 04:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
pollution episode provisions of
 
04:37:54.551 --> 04:37:54.561 align:start position:0%
125c um but I don't know that that would
 
04:37:56.789 --> 04:37:56.799 align:start position:0%
qualify as a cease and desist
 
04:37:58.949 --> 04:37:58.959 align:start position:0%
order I would have to consult with the
 
04:38:00.990 --> 04:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
AG's office on our ability to notify
 
04:38:03.789 --> 04:38:03.799 align:start position:0%
federal agencies of doing things if if
 
04:38:06.230 --> 04:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
authorized by the federal government
 
04:38:08.390 --> 04:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
and the same goes with notifying foreign
 
04:38:10.670 --> 04:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
States or International bodies of
 
04:38:13.349 --> 04:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
potential activities under the bill I
 
04:38:15.551 --> 04:38:15.561 align:start position:0%
have we have another number of technical
 
04:38:17.551 --> 04:38:17.561 align:start position:0%
issues with the bill um regarding some
 
04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
of the specific Provisions I'm not sure
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
how we would Implement them um I'll just
 
04:38:24.349 --> 04:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
use as an example the bill States Dees
 
04:38:26.150 --> 04:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
shall post advertisements in newspapers
 
04:38:27.629 --> 04:38:27.639 align:start position:0%
and other websites encouraging the
 
04:38:29.670 --> 04:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
public to monitor measured document and
 
04:38:33.551 --> 04:38:33.561 align:start position:0%
report that requirement is is unclear to
 
04:38:35.789 --> 04:38:35.799 align:start position:0%
me and not very specific I don't know
 
04:38:37.590 --> 04:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
how I would satisfy that requirement
 
04:38:40.629 --> 04:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
without further guidance it talks about
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
submitting photographs videos
 
04:38:45.470 --> 04:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
audiography lab tests microscopy
 
04:38:48.670 --> 04:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
spectroscopy meter unsure what Dees
 
04:38:49.869 --> 04:38:49.879 align:start position:0%
would do with those pieces of
 
04:38:52.629 --> 04:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
information um I I I don't know that a
 
04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
single photograph of a of a airplane in
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
the sky um would be evidence of
 
04:38:59.279 --> 04:39:03.349 align:start position:0%
the sky um would be evidence of
anything

04:39:03.349 --> 04:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:05.910 --> 04:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
um I guess the only other thing I would
 
04:39:08.189 --> 04:39:08.199 align:start position:0%
say is with respect to the uh resource
 
04:39:11.109 --> 04:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
load of this bill um there certainly is
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
no revenues associated with this bill
 
04:39:15.551 --> 04:39:15.561 align:start position:0%
and I can guarantee you that I do not
 
04:39:17.349 --> 04:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
have the staff to do that without a
 
04:39:17.359 --> 04:39:19.789 align:start position:0%
have the staff to do that without a
revenue

04:39:19.789 --> 04:39:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
Source thank you do you have any
 
04:39:24.269 --> 04:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
estimate at all of what it might end up
 
04:39:26.590 --> 04:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
costing to
 
04:39:29.670 --> 04:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
enforce the provisions of this bill what
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
it might cost agency given our lack of
 
04:39:34.629 --> 04:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
expertise and knowledge in this area I
 
04:39:36.390 --> 04:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
think I think we estimated in the fiscal
 
04:39:38.628 --> 04:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
note it could be upwards of 10
 
04:39:42.868 --> 04:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
staff I I I can't sit here today and say
 
04:39:45.190 --> 04:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
I can guarantee that could it be five
 
04:39:47.910 --> 04:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
maybe could it be 15
 
04:39:53.230 --> 04:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:55.590 --> 04:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:39:58.830 --> 04:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
muns thank you Mr chair thank you for uh
 
04:40:01.230 --> 04:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
for coming in um I I think you already
 
04:40:02.670 --> 04:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
answered the question but I want to just
 
04:40:04.990 --> 04:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
be very very sure I understood do
 
04:40:08.990 --> 04:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
correctly to your knowledge there are no
 
04:40:14.350 --> 04:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
published reports that um document any
 
04:40:17.550 --> 04:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
of what is um what we've heard has been
 
04:40:19.910 --> 04:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
happening in New Hampshire there's no
 
04:40:22.350 --> 04:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
documentation of that available that you
 
04:40:25.470 --> 04:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
know we we could
 
04:40:28.948 --> 04:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
review I I personally am not aware of
 
04:40:30.910 --> 04:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
any such reports that appear reviewed
 
04:40:34.708 --> 04:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
scientific studies um I've heard it
 
04:40:36.310 --> 04:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned here today that such reports
 
04:40:38.910 --> 04:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
exist I I am not aware of them and I do
 
04:40:43.510 --> 04:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:46.470 --> 04:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
them followup please uh keep your
 
04:40:48.470 --> 04:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
comments to yourself thank you
 
04:40:50.390 --> 04:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative Ms you need a followup
 
04:40:53.550 --> 04:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
followup yeah I I I would just ask that
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
um if there are reports available um
 
04:41:00.190 --> 04:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
that um they be forwarded to us but um
 
04:41:03.708 --> 04:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
that they be specific to experience in
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm not really interested
 
04:41:07.868 --> 04:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
in knowing what happened in
 
04:41:09.948 --> 04:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
California additional questions
 
04:41:13.510 --> 04:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
04:41:17.310 --> 04:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
um as as um someone who works in the uh
 
04:41:21.150 --> 04:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Air uh resources do you
 
04:41:24.590 --> 04:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
does New Hampshire or I'm sorry oh the
 
04:41:24.600 --> 04:41:25.830 align:start position:0%
does New Hampshire or I'm sorry oh the
director

04:41:25.830 --> 04:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
director
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
sorry um in New Hampshire do you test
 
04:41:33.590 --> 04:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
for sulfur uh chemicals and graphite
 
04:41:36.270 --> 04:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
chemicals so so in the air thank you for
 
04:41:38.708 --> 04:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
the question um in New Hampshire we
 
04:41:41.190 --> 04:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
operate a network of I think 13
 
04:41:41.200 --> 04:41:42.310 align:start position:0%
operate a network of I think 13
monitoring

04:41:42.310 --> 04:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring
 
04:41:42.320 --> 04:41:44.190 align:start position:0%
monitoring
sites

04:41:44.190 --> 04:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
sites
 
04:41:47.948 --> 04:41:47.958 align:start position:0%
we monitor for sulfur dioxide at three
 
04:41:50.708 --> 04:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
sites in New Hampshire one in Penbrook
 
04:41:56.270 --> 04:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
one in um top of Pacman adock and um the
 
04:41:59.070 --> 04:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
other one in londonairy we also monitor
 
04:42:02.030 --> 04:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
for ozone at a number of sites across
 
04:42:05.390 --> 04:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
the state uh we monitor for
 
04:42:08.270 --> 04:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
certain ozone precursor organic
 
04:42:10.390 --> 04:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
compounds at two sites in the state I
 
04:42:13.310 --> 04:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
could certainly provide to the committee
 
04:42:15.270 --> 04:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
um what we monitor for and where we
 
04:42:17.990 --> 04:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
monitor it um representative gearhard
 
04:42:20.628 --> 04:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned particular matter we do
 
04:42:22.550 --> 04:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
monitor for a particular matter at six
 
04:42:25.948 --> 04:42:25.958 align:start position:0%
sites across the state um three of those
 
04:42:27.868 --> 04:42:27.878 align:start position:0%
sites are filter-based
 
04:42:30.910 --> 04:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
sites um we do not monitor those filters
 
04:42:33.350 --> 04:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
for chemical composition we simply weigh
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
them for the amount of particular matter
 
04:42:37.470 --> 04:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
that is collected we're measuring all
 
04:42:39.350 --> 04:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
those up against what we call the
 
04:42:41.110 --> 04:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
Federal National ambient air quality
 
04:42:43.750 --> 04:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
standards follow up follow up and are
 
04:42:48.590 --> 04:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
you seeing an increase in any um any
 
04:42:52.990 --> 04:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
particular uh component in general
 
04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
long-term pollution trends for the
 
04:42:56.948 --> 04:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
pollutants that we monitor for are
 
04:42:58.670 --> 04:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
decreasing over
 
04:43:00.550 --> 04:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
time I'm sorry you say they're
 
04:43:04.270 --> 04:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
decreasing decreasing over time um one
 
04:43:04.280 --> 04:43:05.150 align:start position:0%
decreasing decreasing over time um one
uh

04:43:05.150 --> 04:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:43:07.310 --> 04:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
this past summer with the wildfires up
 
04:43:10.150 --> 04:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
in Canada we probably saw some very
 
04:43:12.948 --> 04:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
extreme PM events uh particularly to our
 
04:43:14.708 --> 04:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
South and West not necessarily here in
 
04:43:18.590 --> 04:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um but that is certainly
 
04:43:21.510 --> 04:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
something we monitor for and we we
 
04:43:24.030 --> 04:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
prepare periodically an annual what we
 
04:43:26.310 --> 04:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
call stateof the air report and I could
 
04:43:27.910 --> 04:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
certainly make that available to the
 
04:43:29.868 --> 04:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
committee as well thank you
 
04:43:32.510 --> 04:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
04:43:35.390 --> 04:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you uh uh
 
04:43:38.310 --> 04:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
Mr R for coming uh to follow up on
 
04:43:39.910 --> 04:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative mun's question about your
 
04:43:42.190 --> 04:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge of of ongoing programs in the
 
04:43:44.310 --> 04:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
area of geoengineering going on anywhere
 
04:43:46.670 --> 04:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
in the continental United States do you
 
04:43:49.750 --> 04:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
have any knowledge of such research
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
programs going on or carried out by the
 
04:43:55.670 --> 04:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
federal government dealing with airplane
 
04:43:57.628 --> 04:43:57.638 align:start position:0%
emissions having to do with
 
04:43:59.670 --> 04:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
geoengineering do have you seen any you
 
04:44:02.830 --> 04:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
know National Oceanic and Atmospheric
 
04:44:04.990 --> 04:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
agency anything any federal agency is
 
04:44:07.070 --> 04:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
doing that kind of research I am not
 
04:44:08.830 --> 04:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
aware of it I haven't seen it I haven't
 
04:44:10.910 --> 04:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
looked for it
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
though additional questions for Mr
 
04:44:18.190 --> 04:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
Wright representative McGee thank you
 
04:44:20.550 --> 04:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
are you are you that Mr Wright no I'm
 
04:44:22.030 --> 04:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
just kidding my mother always told me
 
04:44:23.868 --> 04:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
I'm Mr could use a little
 
04:44:28.230 --> 04:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
break you can ask my ex-wife so so my
 
04:44:31.788 --> 04:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
question that's funny um see you had the
 
04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
less left that's great um Okay so so my
 
04:44:36.430 --> 04:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
question goes back to something I was
 
04:44:38.750 --> 04:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
questioning before which is that a lot
 
04:44:40.628 --> 04:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
of times we have folks come into the
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
committee room who aren't really sure
 
04:44:46.230 --> 04:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
how um there are many systems involved
 
04:44:48.868 --> 04:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
and many people making decisions up and
 
04:44:50.550 --> 04:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
down the ladder and everyone isn't
 
04:44:52.788 --> 04:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
always you know is isn't always aware of
 
04:44:55.190 --> 04:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
that my understanding is that the state
 
04:44:56.470 --> 04:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire would have to be
 
04:44:58.350 --> 04:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
consulted if there was going to be any
 
04:45:01.550 --> 04:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
type of geoengineering over us and so I
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
would like you
 
04:45:05.948 --> 04:45:05.958 align:start position:0%
to chime in on that if you're aware of
 
04:45:08.150 --> 04:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
that in terms of just the governmental
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
hierarchy I I can't say that I could you
 
04:45:13.390 --> 04:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't know okay I hate I
 
04:45:18.390 --> 04:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:22.628 --> 04:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
thanks okay any other questions seeing
 
04:45:24.270 --> 04:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
none I want to thank you Mr Wright for
 
04:45:26.510 --> 04:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
being here toh testify and we'll look
 
04:45:28.350 --> 04:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
forward to the information you can send
 
04:45:31.550 --> 04:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
us about air quality in New Hampshire
 
04:45:33.990 --> 04:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
and with that we're going to recess this
 
04:45:36.350 --> 04:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
public public hearing until Monday the
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
22nd of January at 100
 
04:45:46.270 --> 04:45:46.280 align:start position:0%

22nd so we're going to take a five
 
04:45:49.590 --> 04:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
minute break and then we're going to
 
04:45:51.868 --> 04:45:51.878 align:start position:0%
come back for a short work session and

I can let uh 10 people have five
 
04:46:19.708 --> 04:46:19.718 align:start position:0%
minutes you don't ask a lot of questions
 
04:46:23.150 --> 04:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
one correct
 
04:46:25.628 --> 04:46:25.638 align:start position:0%
correct however if I start hearing
 
04:46:28.750 --> 04:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
repetitive testimony then I'm going to
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of time allowed to two
 
04:46:33.200 --> 04:46:36.150 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of time allowed to two
minutes

04:46:36.150 --> 04:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
04:46:39.150 --> 04:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
please uh come up here if you want to
 
04:46:39.160 --> 04:47:03.110 align:start position:0%

04:55:23.230 --> 04:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
went to oh there he
 
04:55:26.150 --> 04:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
is I'd like to ask representative
 
04:55:29.830 --> 04:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
Bernardi to uh make a few comments
 
04:55:32.270 --> 04:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
before we have a discussion amongst the
 
04:55:34.590 --> 04:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee about this this
 
04:55:39.190 --> 04:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman uh rep clog
 
04:55:43.270 --> 04:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
is handing out our um
 
04:55:43.280 --> 04:55:45.070 align:start position:0%
is handing out our um
some

04:55:45.070 --> 04:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:55:49.350 --> 04:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh sheets which indicate the uh well
 
04:55:51.948 --> 04:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
there's three of them one you saw last
 
04:55:54.230 --> 04:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
last time we met on this bill which is
 
04:55:58.430 --> 04:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
the uh the cost of Power by eversource
 
04:56:02.310 --> 04:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and and uh
 
04:56:04.990 --> 04:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and what the how the rates
 
04:56:09.548 --> 04:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
went up and down the second two are the
 
04:56:13.708 --> 04:56:13.718 align:start position:0%
costs of natural gas uh one says natural
 
04:56:16.150 --> 04:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
gas US Dollars mm
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
BTUs um and the cost is going from0 to
 
04:56:23.628 --> 04:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
$10 on the right hand side you see it
 
04:56:28.750 --> 04:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
peaks in August uh around
 
04:56:33.830 --> 04:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
$95 August of 22 that is uh the second
 
04:56:39.390 --> 04:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
is natural gas Dutch TTC that's how they
 
04:56:42.070 --> 04:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh in Euros per megawatt hour that's how
 
04:56:48.830 --> 04:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
they uh Co do their GS gas costing um
 
04:56:51.470 --> 04:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
and I've written at the top of that
 
04:56:54.750 --> 04:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
August Peak that equates to
 
04:57:03.310 --> 04:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
$72 per uh um uh million uh BTUs uh
 
04:57:07.590 --> 04:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
equating it to the US equivalent so 9
 
04:57:11.190 --> 04:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
and a half in the US at the peak
 
04:57:15.590 --> 04:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
72 in Europe at the peak Mr
 
04:57:17.948 --> 04:57:17.958 align:start position:0%
chairman yes I'm sorry to interrupt
 
04:57:19.548 --> 04:57:19.558 align:start position:0%
representative Berard we don't have this
 
04:57:20.910 --> 04:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
information in front of us yet and it
 
04:57:23.190 --> 04:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
would be really helpful as as you're
 
04:57:25.310 --> 04:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
narrating about it to have it so can you
 
04:57:26.830 --> 04:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
is it possible to just hold up for a
 
04:57:30.070 --> 04:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
moment until we have it two seconds okay
 
04:57:31.990 --> 04:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
just suspend for a second while we get
 
04:57:33.990 --> 04:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
this material pass
 
04:57:34.000 --> 04:57:52.548 align:start position:0%
this material pass
out

04:57:52.548 --> 04:57:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:55.390 --> 04:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
yeah there there should be three sheets
 
04:57:58.230 --> 04:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
one is one is the eversource rates New
 
04:58:00.310 --> 04:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Massachusetts with the red
 
04:58:04.270 --> 04:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
and blue lines that we saw last
 
04:58:07.270 --> 04:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
session last committee meeting excuse me
 
04:58:10.510 --> 04:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
the second is natural gas in the EU has
 
04:58:18.470 --> 04:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:21.590 --> 04:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
bucks and the third is natural gas
 
04:58:23.190 --> 04:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
prices in the
 
04:58:31.670 --> 04:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:35.230 --> 04:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:37.750 --> 04:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
three okay I got one now you want got
 
04:58:42.030 --> 04:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
one yeah okay you have another one send
 
04:58:48.690 --> 04:58:48.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:48.700 --> 04:58:52.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:58:52.750 --> 04:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:55.670 --> 04:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
fun are we
 
04:58:59.590 --> 04:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
so I have
 
04:59:02.040 --> 04:59:05.470 align:start position:0%
so I have
mine

04:59:05.470 --> 04:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:07.110 --> 04:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
there should be a couple extra and I
 
04:59:11.390 --> 04:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:17.390 --> 04:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:21.150 --> 04:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
are so uh the
 
04:59:24.390 --> 04:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
reason I I did this was to try to
 
04:59:26.230 --> 04:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
understand in Greater
 
04:59:29.510 --> 04:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
granularity the first uh sheet that we
 
04:59:34.390 --> 04:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
got from uh the DOE last committee
 
04:59:36.830 --> 04:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
meeting which gave the New Hampshire and
 
04:59:39.310 --> 04:59:39.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts rates and showed that
 
04:59:42.190 --> 04:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
tremendous doubling in New
 
04:59:44.628 --> 04:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh around the August time
 
04:59:48.030 --> 04:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
frame this these other two documents
 
04:59:51.548 --> 04:59:51.558 align:start position:0%
explain that whereas most most gas in
 
04:59:57.110 --> 04:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
the US is at the at the US rate which
 
05:00:00.430 --> 05:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
obviously went up significantly we do
 
05:00:04.750 --> 05:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
get the residual or the EXT that we need
 
05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
uh from
 
05:00:11.548 --> 05:00:11.558 align:start position:0%
um uh by boat uh and that reflects the
 
05:00:14.390 --> 05:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
European rate so that's why we're also
 
05:00:18.310 --> 05:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
influenced by that uh that costing as
 
05:00:21.150 --> 05:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
well and you see that it did Peak
 
05:00:23.990 --> 05:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
significantly in August up the
 
05:00:29.708 --> 05:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
$72 so um having listened to uh the Pu
 
05:00:34.470 --> 05:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
and the doe last uh committee meeting uh
 
05:00:39.190 --> 05:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
I thought it a appropriate uh to
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
continue to evaluate this uh they were
 
05:00:46.030 --> 05:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
not very sanguin on the bill that was
 
05:00:49.548 --> 05:00:49.558 align:start position:0%
proposed I would I asked uh assistant
 
05:00:52.150 --> 05:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh Elms this morning
 
05:00:58.788 --> 05:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
whether doe could model the impact of uh
 
05:01:02.910 --> 05:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
changing our electric rates still having
 
05:01:06.310 --> 05:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
standard six-month contracts yet do it
 
05:01:09.628 --> 05:01:09.638 align:start position:0%
on a quarterly basis so every quarter
 
05:01:12.230 --> 05:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
one half of the contracts that are that
 
05:01:16.990 --> 05:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
need to be renewed get reviewed if they
 
05:01:21.390 --> 05:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
modeled uh what the likely cost would be
 
05:01:25.110 --> 05:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
to our rates based on that kind of
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
approach with the natural gas prices
 
05:01:32.910 --> 05:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
being the driver um would that show that
 
05:01:36.150 --> 05:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
we would not have paid as much for as
 
05:01:41.190 --> 05:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
long by my unsophisticated eyeball
 
05:01:44.948 --> 05:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
not not any mathematical modeling I
 
05:01:47.110 --> 05:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
would say yes it
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
would um so I'm interested in seeing
 
05:01:52.628 --> 05:01:52.638 align:start position:0%
whether that approach would work that is
 
05:01:55.310 --> 05:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
not going full laddering and allowing
 
05:01:57.150 --> 05:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
contracts of all kinds of differential
 
05:01:59.708 --> 05:01:59.718 align:start position:0%
rates and and whatnot but a a
 
05:02:04.030 --> 05:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
programmatic approach of uh uh quarterly
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
rate setting half of the contracts up
 
05:02:10.150 --> 05:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
each quarter would that have been a
 
05:02:13.868 --> 05:02:13.878 align:start position:0%
benefit to New Hampshire rate payers um
 
05:02:16.590 --> 05:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
so that modeling uh
 
05:02:21.910 --> 05:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
again your boss said is okay so um I'm
 
05:02:25.948 --> 05:02:25.958 align:start position:0%
GNA ask that Doe would do that um and if
 
05:02:28.708 --> 05:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
that shows a benefit then I would
 
05:02:33.230 --> 05:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
suggest that we um amend the bill to
 
05:02:35.910 --> 05:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
reflect that and I and also I'm
 
05:02:39.390 --> 05:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
sensitive to what I heard last uh
 
05:02:42.948 --> 05:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
committee meeting that we not prescribe
 
05:02:46.590 --> 05:02:46.600 align:start position:0%
that as the defined and only method but
 
05:02:49.590 --> 05:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
that we allow the
 
05:02:52.990 --> 05:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
uh that approach or other approaches be
 
05:02:56.430 --> 05:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
used that would have the opportunity to
 
05:02:59.628 --> 05:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
drive our prices closer to Market rates
 
05:02:59.638 --> 05:03:00.548 align:start position:0%
drive our prices closer to Market rates
and

05:03:00.548 --> 05:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:05.830 --> 05:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
therefore minimize imp PS uh that a
 
05:03:10.190 --> 05:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
long-term contract has in keeping rates
 
05:03:13.548 --> 05:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
elevated so that's that's my my thought
 
05:03:17.510 --> 05:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
here um and as far as I'm concerned we
 
05:03:20.190 --> 05:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
can discuss whether that makes sense and
 
05:03:22.750 --> 05:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
and if it does then I would propose this
 
05:03:25.990 --> 05:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
bill go to interim study to get that
 
05:03:29.470 --> 05:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
information we also I think should get
 
05:03:32.750 --> 05:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
Doe's promised report on this issue
 
05:03:37.470 --> 05:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
before we take any um any new bill up or
 
05:03:39.470 --> 05:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
an amended Bill
 
05:03:42.390 --> 05:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
up okay thank you I would concur with
 
05:03:45.868 --> 05:03:45.878 align:start position:0%
you that referring this bill for interim
 
05:03:48.310 --> 05:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
study would probably be the best way to
 
05:03:51.030 --> 05:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
go because there are many many
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions here and a lot of
 
05:03:57.070 --> 05:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
data Gathering that needs to be done to
 
05:03:59.510 --> 05:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
fully understand this issue
 
05:03:59.520 --> 05:04:01.310 align:start position:0%
fully understand this issue
representative

05:04:01.310 --> 05:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:04:04.750 --> 05:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
Thomas um thank you um thank you for
 
05:04:08.350 --> 05:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
clarifying uh this bill a little bit
 
05:04:11.350 --> 05:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
more um in my notes from from the
 
05:04:14.708 --> 05:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
hearing I wrote uh risk premium is the
 
05:04:18.030 --> 05:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
culprit so how does the change that
 
05:04:20.110 --> 05:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
you're talking about right now how does
 
05:04:24.590 --> 05:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:27.310 --> 05:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
premium well well the the spikes that
 
05:04:28.670 --> 05:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
you see
 
05:04:33.110 --> 05:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
are are risk premium driven
 
05:04:37.150 --> 05:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
to some extent particularly the giant
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
spikes I mean that that's uh that's a
 
05:04:43.310 --> 05:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
response to different activities that
 
05:04:46.190 --> 05:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
are occurring in the world at the time
 
05:04:49.310 --> 05:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
and you see it drops off significantly
 
05:04:53.510 --> 05:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
after the those spikes occur that's the
 
05:04:57.548 --> 05:04:57.558 align:start position:0%
risk is now considered less urgent and
 
05:04:59.350 --> 05:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
less compelling and therefore the price
 
05:05:02.548 --> 05:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
is dropping back to a more normal Market
 
05:05:07.310 --> 05:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
Market uh level so
 
05:05:11.430 --> 05:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
um as I suggested the approach of of
 
05:05:14.750 --> 05:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
having defined contracts uh done on a
 
05:05:17.310 --> 05:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis half of them each
 
05:05:23.310 --> 05:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
quarter um I I think just by ey takes
 
05:05:26.868 --> 05:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
some of that risk premium off the table
 
05:05:29.868 --> 05:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
but I would like to see that modeled to
 
05:05:32.030 --> 05:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
verify my assumption I don't I can't
 
05:05:34.590 --> 05:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
swear to you that that's truth
 
05:05:37.070 --> 05:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a comment
 
05:05:39.110 --> 05:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you um a couple of
 
05:05:41.430 --> 05:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
comments actually uh first with the risk
 
05:05:44.750 --> 05:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
premium changing it it reduces that
 
05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't reduce the RIS risk premium but
 
05:05:49.708 --> 05:05:49.718 align:start position:0%
reduces the amount of the load that's
 
05:05:51.230 --> 05:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
subject to that because you're going to
 
05:05:53.510 --> 05:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
break it up into two separate contracts
 
05:05:55.628 --> 05:05:55.638 align:start position:0%
that are going to be half the load for
 
05:05:57.548 --> 05:05:57.558 align:start position:0%
this six-month period and have to load
 
05:05:59.670 --> 05:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
for another so if you were in a period
 
05:06:02.990 --> 05:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
of highrisk Premium because it would be
 
05:06:04.310 --> 05:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
basically the you know more or less the
 
05:06:05.430 --> 05:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
same because you're looking into the
 
05:06:07.548 --> 05:06:07.558 align:start position:0%
future that's what sets the risk premium
 
05:06:10.430 --> 05:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
so if there was a high spike in there it
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
would only affect half the load so it
 
05:06:13.788 --> 05:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be as impactful of course when
 
05:06:16.110 --> 05:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
the prices go down you would only get it
 
05:06:18.070 --> 05:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
going down for half the load so I mean
 
05:06:21.670 --> 05:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
it's a balance um this was done in the
 
05:06:23.948 --> 05:06:23.958 align:start position:0%
days before uh Public Service had
 
05:06:26.510 --> 05:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
divested all of their generation the
 
05:06:28.788 --> 05:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
other utilities like Unitil and Liberty
 
05:06:30.830 --> 05:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
did come in with contracts where it was
 
05:06:33.110 --> 05:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
for I think it was 50% of their load I
 
05:06:35.070 --> 05:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
may not be sure but I I know they had
 
05:06:37.590 --> 05:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
them staggered like that in the past now
 
05:06:39.910 --> 05:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
why they stopped doing that I don't know
 
05:06:42.230 --> 05:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
I just I I wasn't at the Pu when it when
 
05:06:44.910 --> 05:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
that occurred so but again I want to get
 
05:06:46.390 --> 05:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
back to the point here I I understand
 
05:06:47.948 --> 05:06:47.958 align:start position:0%
the inim study which I think is a good
 
05:06:50.310 --> 05:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
idea I'm not sure that there's much
 
05:06:52.030 --> 05:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
we're still talking about that the Pu
 
05:06:54.150 --> 05:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't already have the authority to do
 
05:06:55.868 --> 05:06:55.878 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to go to splitting them
 
05:06:58.510 --> 05:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
up into you know 50% of the load
 
05:07:01.430 --> 05:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
contracts uh and staggered the starting
 
05:07:03.270 --> 05:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh times of those I think they have the
 
05:07:05.948 --> 05:07:05.958 align:start position:0%
authority to do that but there seems to
 
05:07:08.070 --> 05:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
be enough questions so I would I could
 
05:07:10.190 --> 05:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
certainly approve uh go along with uh
 
05:07:12.110 --> 05:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
inum study and then get all of those
 
05:07:15.230 --> 05:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
answered get the report that your that U
 
05:07:17.470 --> 05:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
representative was referring to back and
 
05:07:20.070 --> 05:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh we can go forward from there yeah the
 
05:07:22.868 --> 05:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
uh the concept of uh
 
05:07:26.230 --> 05:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
um the Pu being able to do this on their
 
05:07:29.230 --> 05:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
own I I I did hear them say that that's
 
05:07:31.390 --> 05:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
potentially an opportunity that's why
 
05:07:33.910 --> 05:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not proposing that we do something
 
05:07:37.708 --> 05:07:37.718 align:start position:0%
foolish and cement in approach but keep
 
05:07:41.430 --> 05:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for the puc open and to
 
05:07:44.110 --> 05:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
also you know if some other brilliant
 
05:07:46.390 --> 05:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
idea comes up they have the opportunity
 
05:07:48.310 --> 05:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
to uh Implement
 
05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
that representative Ms has a comment
 
05:07:56.830 --> 05:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm glad you said that because um
 
05:07:59.990 --> 05:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
I I'm you know I was I I'm wondering
 
05:08:01.510 --> 05:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
whether other members of the committee
 
05:08:04.310 --> 05:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
took a look at the amendment that uh
 
05:08:06.270 --> 05:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
eversource had proposed or the language
 
05:08:09.948 --> 05:08:09.958 align:start position:0%
that eversource had proposed which I
 
05:08:12.470 --> 05:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
think does what you just said you were
 
05:08:14.628 --> 05:08:14.638 align:start position:0%
hoping to do which is kind of keeps it
 
05:08:17.110 --> 05:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
keeps it like wide open it doesn't set a
 
05:08:18.868 --> 05:08:18.878 align:start position:0%
prescription that says it's got to be
 
05:08:20.868 --> 05:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
every six months and it's got to be
 
05:08:24.868 --> 05:08:24.878 align:start position:0%
50% um so I mean I after I read that
 
05:08:26.788 --> 05:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
proposed language I thought that made
 
05:08:29.788 --> 05:08:29.798 align:start position:0%
some sense and keeps our options open so
 
05:08:33.510 --> 05:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
I just was curious what others felt
 
05:08:36.310 --> 05:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
I I agree with the eversource approach
 
05:08:41.190 --> 05:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
does keep the options open for best uh
 
05:08:43.230 --> 05:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
practices further
 
05:08:46.110 --> 05:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
comments representative McGee this was
 
05:08:47.590 --> 05:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
just kind of a clarification I was
 
05:08:49.390 --> 05:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
looking at my notes as well and I had
 
05:08:53.190 --> 05:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
the note um that the that the utilities
 
05:08:55.150 --> 05:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
can already pursue lading and that the
 
05:09:00.030 --> 05:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
Pu already has the latitude to make uh
 
05:09:02.990 --> 05:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
their review more frequent if or you
 
05:09:05.390 --> 05:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
know they can they can schedule things
 
05:09:08.190 --> 05:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
how it makes the most sense so I don't
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
think we need to step into those
 
05:09:12.070 --> 05:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
processes but I think the interim stud
 
05:09:13.750 --> 05:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
is a good idea and the thing I wanted to
 
05:09:17.030 --> 05:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
make comment on was I guess maybe I'm
 
05:09:19.750 --> 05:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
all on an island but my understanding of
 
05:09:24.110 --> 05:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
the risk premium was that if if uh if a
 
05:09:27.070 --> 05:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
buyer enters into a long-term contract
 
05:09:29.310 --> 05:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
the risk premium often has something to
 
05:09:31.788 --> 05:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
do with taking into account the fact
 
05:09:33.628 --> 05:09:33.638 align:start position:0%
that the market May fluctuate over the
 
05:09:36.270 --> 05:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
course of that contract right so if
 
05:09:40.548 --> 05:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
everybody's paying 4 cents um they may
 
05:09:43.070 --> 05:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
make it six cents or a little high you
 
05:09:44.590 --> 05:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
know they may say I can give you this
 
05:09:46.868 --> 05:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
for 20 years but I I can't go below that
 
05:09:48.510 --> 05:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
because I have to build in the risk of
 
05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that the prices could go up so
 
05:09:54.230 --> 05:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
the length of the contract also
 
05:09:57.628 --> 05:09:57.638 align:start position:0%
contributes to both stability which we
 
05:09:59.190 --> 05:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
had that language in here right that we
 
05:10:02.150 --> 05:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
wanted price stability and also uh
 
05:10:03.750 --> 05:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
whether somebody can actually guarantee
 
05:10:05.390 --> 05:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
you that they can give you that that
 
05:10:08.628 --> 05:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
price over time so it's there's a lot
 
05:10:11.390 --> 05:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
here to study and I don't think we're
 
05:10:13.390 --> 05:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
ready to pass a bill that has language
 
05:10:15.548 --> 05:10:15.558 align:start position:0%
in it that that everybody could live
 
05:10:18.350 --> 05:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
with I concur that's why I think inter
 
05:10:18.360 --> 05:10:24.190 align:start position:0%
with I concur that's why I think inter
studies

05:10:24.190 --> 05:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:26.830 --> 05:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate all right other comments
 
05:10:26.840 --> 05:10:28.670 align:start position:0%
appropriate all right other comments
representative

05:10:28.670 --> 05:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:10:31.390 --> 05:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
cren thank you turbos thanks for taking
 
05:10:32.548 --> 05:10:32.558 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:10:35.548 --> 05:10:35.558 align:start position:0%
um I guess just going back to last year
 
05:10:37.470 --> 05:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we heard I could
 
05:10:39.910 --> 05:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
swear that we heard testimony that part
 
05:10:42.230 --> 05:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
of the reason that Community power was
 
05:10:44.788 --> 05:10:44.798 align:start position:0%
able to kind of keep their rates a
 
05:10:47.590 --> 05:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
little bit flatter than um eversource
 
05:10:49.708 --> 05:10:49.718 align:start position:0%
and Liberty was because they were
 
05:10:53.310 --> 05:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to pursue this approach and the
 
05:10:55.150 --> 05:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
other utilities weren't so I feel like
 
05:10:57.990 --> 05:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit confused about now the
 
05:11:00.510 --> 05:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
idea that actually they always did have
 
05:11:02.590 --> 05:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
this power because I feel like we heard
 
05:11:04.030 --> 05:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
alternatively that they didn't and I'm
 
05:11:05.788 --> 05:11:05.798 align:start position:0%
sorry if I'm not articulating this very
 
05:11:08.190 --> 05:11:08.200 align:start position:0%
well but can someone tell me that I'm
 
05:11:10.548 --> 05:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
not crazy or how I was misunderstanding
 
05:11:12.868 --> 05:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
that testimony last
 
05:11:16.910 --> 05:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
year I don't think you're crazy I I I I
 
05:11:19.548 --> 05:11:19.558 align:start position:0%
I I think I I think that was one of the
 
05:11:22.070 --> 05:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
arguments that Community power made and
 
05:11:23.910 --> 05:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
I think eversource came to the table and
 
05:11:26.708 --> 05:11:26.718 align:start position:0%
said we have an order from the P that we
 
05:11:29.310 --> 05:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
have to do this every six months so
 
05:11:31.750 --> 05:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
they're operating that way now I don't
 
05:11:31.760 --> 05:11:33.030 align:start position:0%
they're operating that way now I don't
you

05:11:33.030 --> 05:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:11:35.470 --> 05:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
Liberty and Unitil I don't know if they
 
05:11:37.628 --> 05:11:37.638 align:start position:0%
have an order doing it but that's how
 
05:11:39.470 --> 05:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
they do
 
05:11:43.830 --> 05:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
it yes followup so it was a pu order but
 
05:11:47.510 --> 05:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
now we're understanding that the Pu can
 
05:11:50.670 --> 05:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
change that order or relax that order
 
05:11:53.030 --> 05:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
whenever they want to and that would
 
05:11:55.230 --> 05:11:55.240 align:start position:0%
solve the problem their testimony was
 
05:11:57.830 --> 05:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
that they have the capability to uh
 
05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:00.878 --> 05:12:02.628 align:start position:0%
 
order

05:12:02.628 --> 05:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
order
 
05:12:04.750 --> 05:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas has a comment thank
 
05:12:07.548 --> 05:12:07.558 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you so I'm I'm just I
 
05:12:09.230 --> 05:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify something you said
 
05:12:12.270 --> 05:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
earlier you at the one hand you said you
 
05:12:14.628 --> 05:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
think interim study is might be a good
 
05:12:16.390 --> 05:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
way to go for this bill but then you
 
05:12:18.310 --> 05:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
also mentioned that you thought that the
 
05:12:21.190 --> 05:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
eversource amendment uh was something
 
05:12:23.590 --> 05:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
that uh was much better and could be
 
05:12:27.628 --> 05:12:27.638 align:start position:0%
pursued so which which is
 
05:12:30.190 --> 05:12:30.200 align:start position:0%
it I think the interim study can look at
 
05:12:32.310 --> 05:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
the words in the eversource amendment as
 
05:12:35.230 --> 05:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
well as what comes out of the doe report
 
05:12:37.948 --> 05:12:37.958 align:start position:0%
and then have a full discussion and see
 
05:12:39.868 --> 05:12:39.878 align:start position:0%
what's the best bill that we can come up
 
05:12:43.990 --> 05:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
with follow up followup okay so
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
essentially then uh you're not
 
05:12:49.628 --> 05:12:49.638 align:start position:0%
recommending uh any bill go forward this
 
05:12:51.548 --> 05:12:51.558 align:start position:0%
year then you're going to wait for
 
05:12:54.310 --> 05:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
interim study to basically say yes we
 
05:12:56.910 --> 05:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
need more legislation or no we don't for
 
05:13:00.070 --> 05:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:02.470 --> 05:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
bium no I think we can have an interim
 
05:13:04.750 --> 05:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
study this year and hopefully get
 
05:13:08.310 --> 05:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
something done the doe bill is supposed
 
05:13:10.030 --> 05:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
doe report supposed to be coming out
 
05:13:11.670 --> 05:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
shortly so hopefully we could have this
 
05:13:14.708 --> 05:13:14.718 align:start position:0%
done by what we have to have it done by
 
05:13:19.350 --> 05:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh mid-march is that correct so the way
 
05:13:21.830 --> 05:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
interim study works is if we put this
 
05:13:24.910 --> 05:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
bill into interim study then we can
 
05:13:27.590 --> 05:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
decide as a committee whether we want to
 
05:13:33.390 --> 05:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
do any further interim study work on it
 
05:13:36.590 --> 05:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
whether we do or not come November we're
 
05:13:39.110 --> 05:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
going to have to issue a report that
 
05:13:44.350 --> 05:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
says we recommend this bill for this for
 
05:13:47.110 --> 05:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
additional legislation or we do not
 
05:13:50.150 --> 05:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
recommend this for additional
 
05:13:52.470 --> 05:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
legislation and usually there's a
 
05:13:55.750 --> 05:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
rationale that's attached to that
 
05:13:59.670 --> 05:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation so if in November we
 
05:14:02.510 --> 05:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
decide that future leg legislation is
 
05:14:04.830 --> 05:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
warranted then we should provide a
 
05:14:07.990 --> 05:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
written La rationale for why we believe
 
05:14:11.628 --> 05:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
that future legislation is
 
05:14:14.150 --> 05:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
needed to get there we probably would
 
05:14:16.590 --> 05:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
have to have a couple of meetings uh to
 
05:14:19.628 --> 05:14:19.638 align:start position:0%
study this uh in the interim between now
 
05:14:22.470 --> 05:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
and next
 
05:14:24.830 --> 05:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
November representative
 
05:14:26.670 --> 05:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr chair I just
 
05:14:27.990 --> 05:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to be clear on the risk premium
 
05:14:29.270 --> 05:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
we've been kind of tossing that term
 
05:14:33.190 --> 05:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
around so the people the main
 
05:14:35.470 --> 05:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
uh source of the risk premium is the
 
05:14:38.190 --> 05:14:38.200 align:start position:0%
day-to-day supply of electricity so it
 
05:14:39.750 --> 05:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
really doesn't make too much difference
 
05:14:42.190 --> 05:14:42.200 align:start position:0%
how longterm the contract is because
 
05:14:44.628 --> 05:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
you're going to be locked into prices so
 
05:14:46.830 --> 05:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
if you make it longer you may see that
 
05:14:48.750 --> 05:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
the supplier might say well I don't know
 
05:14:51.230 --> 05:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
what the gas prices are going to be a
 
05:14:53.350 --> 05:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
year from now so I have to build in a
 
05:14:54.910 --> 05:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
little bit more of my contract just in
 
05:14:56.830 --> 05:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
case they're higher than I expect but
 
05:14:59.190 --> 05:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
the other part of that is on any given
 
05:15:02.628 --> 05:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
day it can be rainy orow know or sunnier
 
05:15:05.548 --> 05:15:05.558 align:start position:0%
colder whatever than was expected and
 
05:15:07.590 --> 05:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
because of that you have to have a risk
 
05:15:09.670 --> 05:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
premium built in to make sure you have
 
05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
enough generation there's going to be
 
05:15:13.470 --> 05:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
times when the supplier is paying
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
someone not to generate electricity
 
05:15:19.110 --> 05:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
because it's a warmer day or it's a
 
05:15:20.868 --> 05:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
cooler day than expected and it's less
 
05:15:22.868 --> 05:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
air conditioning load and it's raining
 
05:15:25.150 --> 05:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
out or whatever so that's that's part of
 
05:15:27.110 --> 05:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
the risk premium it's it's not only just
 
05:15:29.910 --> 05:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
the risk of going forward uh on the
 
05:15:31.150 --> 05:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
contracts because most of those
 
05:15:34.030 --> 05:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
contracts get locked up the supplier who
 
05:15:36.190 --> 05:15:36.200 align:start position:0%
who signs the contract with utility is
 
05:15:38.350 --> 05:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
going to have a contract with generators
 
05:15:39.830 --> 05:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
and they're going to give them more or
 
05:15:42.708 --> 05:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
less a fixed price but we no one knows
 
05:15:44.190 --> 05:15:44.200 align:start position:0%
what the weather is going to be 6 months
 
05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
from now and that's what the real risk
 
05:15:47.948 --> 05:15:47.958 align:start position:0%
premium is built in and it's that 247
 
05:15:52.030 --> 05:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
365 matching load to
 
05:15:55.868 --> 05:15:55.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:59.070 --> 05:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
comments representative L Wiki uh thank
 
05:16:01.548 --> 05:16:01.558 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um might it me more
 
05:16:03.310 --> 05:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do something like tabling
 
05:16:05.350 --> 05:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
rather than interm study basically defer
 
05:16:06.628 --> 05:16:06.638 align:start position:0%
this until we have a little bit more
 
05:16:08.708 --> 05:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
information but not um you know do a
 
05:16:11.750 --> 05:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
formal interm St
 
05:16:14.670 --> 05:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
study well a committee can't table a
 
05:16:18.750 --> 05:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
bill we could defer an exec
 
05:16:21.670 --> 05:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
session but I don't see personally any
 
05:16:24.788 --> 05:16:24.798 align:start position:0%
need to do that because uh I don't think
 
05:16:27.190 --> 05:16:27.200 align:start position:0%
there's any part of this bill that would
 
05:16:31.470 --> 05:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
be worthwhile going forward with and if
 
05:16:32.990 --> 05:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
If all we're going to do is study this
 
05:16:34.350 --> 05:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
question then we can do that by
 
05:16:39.590 --> 05:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:39.600 --> 05:16:41.430 align:start position:0%
 
study

05:16:41.430 --> 05:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
study
 
05:16:43.868 --> 05:16:43.878 align:start position:0%
okay representative Kennedy did you have
 
05:16:46.470 --> 05:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
a comment yeah uh JD were you were you
 
05:16:48.230 --> 05:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
thinking this could be done by March
 
05:16:50.670 --> 05:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
because can you end an interim study
 
05:16:52.990 --> 05:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
early I mean can you issue the report
 
05:16:55.788 --> 05:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
you know in a by March and then have an
 
05:16:57.868 --> 05:16:57.878 align:start position:0%
amendment and somehow get it get it to
 
05:17:00.948 --> 05:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
the General Session well I understand a
 
05:17:03.270 --> 05:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
normal circumstances interim study
 
05:17:07.910 --> 05:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
reports I due in March before the next
 
05:17:11.830 --> 05:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
election that's that's but I I
 
05:17:15.628 --> 05:17:15.638 align:start position:0%
did think that potentially if all all
 
05:17:17.708 --> 05:17:17.718 align:start position:0%
stars aligned we could have something
 
05:17:20.470 --> 05:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
that we could work on before the house
 
05:17:23.788 --> 05:17:23.798 align:start position:0%
bills all have to cross over but that
 
05:17:27.830 --> 05:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
probably is a an error on my part yes
 
05:17:29.910 --> 05:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
you misspoke you said March you meant
 
05:17:33.190 --> 05:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
November yes that's when as a matter of
 
05:17:36.390 --> 05:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
fact the way this works is once we
 
05:17:38.708 --> 05:17:38.718 align:start position:0%
submit this bill for interim study the
 
05:17:41.150 --> 05:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
clerk and the speaker will not let us
 
05:17:44.030 --> 05:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
touch it again until next
 
05:17:48.430 --> 05:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
fall it'll be off limits until fall so
 
05:17:49.788 --> 05:17:49.798 align:start position:0%
we late
 
05:17:54.110 --> 05:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
summer uh Vice chair Thomas yeah um just
 
05:17:56.030 --> 05:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
not to money the water but just to
 
05:17:58.948 --> 05:17:58.958 align:start position:0%
rephrase uh what the chair just said
 
05:17:58.958 --> 05:18:00.070 align:start position:0%
rephrase uh what the chair just said
interim

05:18:00.070 --> 05:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
interim
 
05:18:02.788 --> 05:18:02.798 align:start position:0%
study if effectively kills the bill for
 
05:18:05.708 --> 05:18:05.718 align:start position:0%
this year the study can we can do a
 
05:18:07.868 --> 05:18:07.878 align:start position:0%
study which will only produce a
 
05:18:09.230 --> 05:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation whether or not there can
 
05:18:12.830 --> 05:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
be legislation or not and then
 
05:18:14.868 --> 05:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
information from that study could be
 
05:18:18.750 --> 05:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
used to write a new bill next bium by
 
05:18:21.270 --> 05:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
whoever happens to be here at the time
 
05:18:23.430 --> 05:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
so that's so effectively nothing will
 
05:18:26.430 --> 05:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
happen with inum study except to come up
 
05:18:28.390 --> 05:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
with a little report on why we should go
 
05:18:31.750 --> 05:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
forward or or not so that's to be be
 
05:18:31.760 --> 05:18:35.910 align:start position:0%
forward or or not so that's to be be
clear

05:18:35.910 --> 05:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:38.310 --> 05:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
okay okay I think that gives us an
 
05:18:41.548 --> 05:18:41.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity now to open an executive
 
05:18:47.430 --> 05:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:51.708 --> 05:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
FN and I will recognize representative
 
05:18:54.430 --> 05:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
Bernardi for a
 
05:18:56.910 --> 05:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
motion as soon as he gets back to his
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
seat thank you Mr chair I move interim

Thomas second it's been moved and
 
05:19:11.310 --> 05:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
seconded that we refer House Bill 1617
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
FN for interim study Is there further
 
05:19:17.590 --> 05:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Thomas thank
 
05:19:20.390 --> 05:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um my only question is
 
05:19:22.548 --> 05:19:22.558 align:start position:0%
there was discussion of the eversource
 
05:19:25.150 --> 05:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
amendment um is there agreement on that
 
05:19:27.590 --> 05:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
can we go forward no there's not okay
 
05:19:32.430 --> 05:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
okay um good I'm good thank you

05:19:39.670 --> 05:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none it appears that
 
05:19:40.948 --> 05:19:40.958 align:start position:0%
we can ask the
 
05:19:44.270 --> 05:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
clerk if he's ready to call the
 
05:19:47.708 --> 05:19:47.718 align:start position:0%
role on the question of refer for
 
05:19:50.350 --> 05:19:50.360 align:start position:0%

due to the house
 
05:21:44.510 --> 05:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
clerk by noon on Wednesdays I'm going to
 
05:21:46.470 --> 05:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
have to ask representative Bernardi to
 
05:21:50.628 --> 05:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
stay here until he finishes writing his
 
05:21:50.638 --> 05:21:55.750 align:start position:0%
stay here until he finishes writing his
report

05:21:55.750 --> 05:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:57.868 --> 05:21:57.878 align:start position:0%
okay and with that we'll end the
 
05:22:02.430 --> 05:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 1616 7-
 
05:22:04.830 --> 05:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
FN and now I'm going to open an
 
05:22:08.750 --> 05:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
executive session on a house bill
 
05:22:11.948 --> 05:22:11.958 align:start position:0%
1627 by agreement with the ranking
 
05:22:14.070 --> 05:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
member we're going
 
05:22:18.310 --> 05:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
to pass judgment on House Bill 1627 Rel
 
05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
which we heard earlier today relative to
 
05:22:26.868 --> 05:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
rodifer railroads transportation and
 
05:22:29.110 --> 05:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications and I recognize
 
05:22:31.948 --> 05:22:31.958 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi for a
 
05:22:35.788 --> 05:22:35.798 align:start position:0%
motion I move out to pass I recognize
 
05:22:37.470 --> 05:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
Vice chair
 
05:22:41.070 --> 05:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
Thomas yes the
 
05:22:43.948 --> 05:22:43.958 align:start position:0%
second it's been moved and seconded that
 
05:22:48.390 --> 05:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
we judge House Bill 1627 to be worthy of
 
05:22:53.548 --> 05:22:53.558 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and let me just say that
 
05:22:55.628 --> 05:22:55.638 align:start position:0%
because this is essentially a
 
05:22:58.628 --> 05:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill that just moves
 
05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
statutes from one title to another
 
05:23:03.670 --> 05:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
there's nothing controversial about it
 
05:23:05.948 --> 05:23:05.958 align:start position:0%
there's nothing partisan about it it's
 
05:23:08.948 --> 05:23:08.958 align:start position:0%
strictly a
 
05:23:11.948 --> 05:23:11.958 align:start position:0%
uh a housekeeping measure and so I would
 
05:23:14.548 --> 05:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
urge you all to support the the motion
 
05:23:16.788 --> 05:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
about to pass any further
 
05:23:19.948 --> 05:23:19.958 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Corbin thank
 
05:23:22.430 --> 05:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
you uh I worked with chair Vose on this
 
05:23:24.350 --> 05:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
and I could not agree
 
05:23:27.470 --> 05:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
more thank you representative reels
 
05:23:28.830 --> 05:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just think we
 
05:23:31.510 --> 05:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
should express our appreciation to you
 
05:23:33.868 --> 05:23:33.878 align:start position:0%
and representative Corman for doing what
 
05:23:36.628 --> 05:23:36.638 align:start position:0%
was surely some tedious work in uh in
 
05:23:39.510 --> 05:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
getting this all down for us it was a
 
05:23:41.830 --> 05:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
tad tedious I will admit and and it was
 
05:23:43.788 --> 05:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
chair Vose who shouldered the tedious
 
05:23:45.390 --> 05:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
05:23:50.350 --> 05:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:52.948 --> 05:23:52.958 align:start position:0%

about our our committee work over the
 
05:25:54.430 --> 05:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
next couple of
 
05:25:58.150 --> 05:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
weeks as you know we missed yesterday
 
05:26:02.070 --> 05:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
because it was a state holiday and next
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
week the Tuesday of next week is primary
 
05:26:07.708 --> 05:26:07.718 align:start position:0%
election day so we've been told we can't
 
05:26:10.628 --> 05:26:10.638 align:start position:0%
schedule committee meetings on that
 
05:26:14.628 --> 05:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
day so next Monday the 22nd of January
 
05:26:16.628 --> 05:26:16.638 align:start position:0%
at 9 o'l in the morning we're going to
 
05:26:19.868 --> 05:26:19.878 align:start position:0%
have a one-hour presentation on Forest
 
05:26:23.628 --> 05:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
carbon credits by Charles
 
05:26:26.270 --> 05:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
LC immediately following that
 
05:26:29.230 --> 05:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
presentation we're going to continue the
 
05:26:31.510 --> 05:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
or resume the public caring on House
 
05:26:31.520 --> 05:26:33.948 align:start position:0%
or resume the public caring on House
Bill

05:26:33.948 --> 05:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:26:37.150 --> 05:26:37.160 align:start position:0%
1697 which is a bill that seeks to
 
05:26:40.390 --> 05:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
suspend Forest carbon
 
05:26:43.868 --> 05:26:43.878 align:start position:0%
credits and due to the large number of
 
05:26:46.750 --> 05:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
pink cards that we had when we sus when
 
05:26:49.070 --> 05:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
we recessed that public hearing last
 
05:26:52.230 --> 05:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
week I'm going to hold two hours for
 
05:26:56.788 --> 05:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
that public hearing so from 10 to to
 
05:27:01.270 --> 05:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
um to 12 will'll have time for that
 
05:27:04.070 --> 05:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
public hearing on 1697 then we'll take a
 
05:27:06.788 --> 05:27:06.798 align:start position:0%
break for lunch and then at 1:00 we're
 
05:27:10.030 --> 05:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
going to come back and have a 2hour
 
05:27:14.310 --> 05:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB 1700 the bill that
 
05:27:17.990 --> 05:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
we started to hear earlier
 
05:27:22.070 --> 05:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
today and I will likely schedule at
 
05:27:25.070 --> 05:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
least one maybe two other hearings after
 
05:27:28.788 --> 05:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
that um in the hope that we can squeeze
 
05:27:31.310 --> 05:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
them in but because we can't meet on
 
05:27:34.708 --> 05:27:34.718 align:start position:0%
Tuesday next week I I'd like to get more
 
05:27:37.788 --> 05:27:37.798 align:start position:0%
than just two bills done next week if
 
05:27:41.830 --> 05:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
possible that means that on the 29th and
 
05:27:44.670 --> 05:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
30th of January which are a Monday and a
 
05:27:46.788 --> 05:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
Tuesday we're going to fill up the
 
05:27:50.390 --> 05:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
calendar on both days with bills and
 
05:27:52.590 --> 05:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
executive sessions work sessions and
 
05:27:55.670 --> 05:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
executive sessions so I don't haven't
 
05:27:58.310 --> 05:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
got that mapped out exactly just yet
 
05:28:00.868 --> 05:28:00.878 align:start position:0%
because the schedule's a little flu with
 
05:28:05.190 --> 05:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
all the uh multi-hour sessions that I'm
 
05:28:08.230 --> 05:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
having to schedule here but uh as soon
 
05:28:10.310 --> 05:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
as I know what we're doing I'll let you
 
05:28:13.110 --> 05:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
guys know but please hold in reserves
 
05:28:15.510 --> 05:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
Monday Tuesday the 29th and 30th for
 
05:28:15.520 --> 05:28:17.190 align:start position:0%
Monday Tuesday the 29th and 30th for
committee

05:28:17.190 --> 05:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:28:20.350 --> 05:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
days and that's uh what we're looking at
 
05:28:22.430 --> 05:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
going forward Vice chair
 
05:28:25.390 --> 05:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
Thomas yes Todd question for the chair
 
05:28:28.230 --> 05:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
um my recommendation might be just to
 
05:28:31.788 --> 05:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
play it safe for Monday can we perhaps
 
05:28:36.110 --> 05:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
on HP 1700 schedule an hour and a half
 
05:28:39.230 --> 05:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh for the bill uh this way uh if we do
 
05:28:41.310 --> 05:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
finish early uh we'll have a little more
 
05:28:44.270 --> 05:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
time to to pick up two other bills that
 
05:28:46.430 --> 05:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
really we need to look at that's a good
 
05:28:46.440 --> 05:28:47.868 align:start position:0%
really we need to look at that's a good
idea

05:28:47.868 --> 05:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
idea
 
05:28:51.510 --> 05:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Thomas yes so are
 
05:28:55.868 --> 05:28:55.878 align:start position:0%
you anticipating by um the 30th that
 
05:28:59.310 --> 05:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:59.320 --> 05:29:01.230 align:start position:0%
 
bills

05:29:01.230 --> 05:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
bills
 
05:29:03.510 --> 05:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's possible but I'm not sure we can
 
05:29:06.590 --> 05:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
fit them all in so if you if you don't
 
05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
mind me ask what what's what's the rush
 
05:29:10.628 --> 05:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
I mean some committees are just meeting
 
05:29:13.868 --> 05:29:13.878 align:start position:0%
for the first time well the only Rush is
 
05:29:15.830 --> 05:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
the speaker has requested that we get
 
05:29:18.990 --> 05:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
bills to him in a timely manner so that
 
05:29:21.910 --> 05:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
he can hold regular Thursday sessions he
 
05:29:23.788 --> 05:29:23.798 align:start position:0%
told us this morning in a chairs meeting
 
05:29:25.708 --> 05:29:25.718 align:start position:0%
that was in this room right before this
 
05:29:28.350 --> 05:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
committee room uh this Committee hearing
 
05:29:32.030 --> 05:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
that he wants to have house sessions all
 
05:29:34.270 --> 05:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
four of the first four Thursdays of
 
05:29:37.310 --> 05:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
February okay so in order for him to be
 
05:29:39.868 --> 05:29:39.878 align:start position:0%
able to do that we have to fill up the
 
05:29:43.470 --> 05:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
pipeline with bills and when I say we I
 
05:29:47.190 --> 05:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
mean all house committees not just s&amp;
 
05:29:49.230 --> 05:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
but we want to do our fair share we want
 
05:29:52.750 --> 05:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
to do our part so I'm trying to get
 
05:29:52.760 --> 05:29:53.830 align:start position:0%
to do our part so I'm trying to get
stuff

05:29:53.830 --> 05:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
05:29:57.628 --> 05:29:57.638 align:start position:0%
done uh in as timely a fashion as I
 
05:29:57.638 --> 05:29:59.230 align:start position:0%
done uh in as timely a fashion as I
can

05:29:59.230 --> 05:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:30:03.350 --> 05:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
and the idea that that we
 
05:30:06.430 --> 05:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
can take a lot of time to do these bills
 
05:30:09.350 --> 05:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
and do it in a casual fashion that's the
 
05:30:12.548 --> 05:30:12.558 align:start position:0%
kind of attitude that puts us in the
 
05:30:15.350 --> 05:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
untenable position of having to have
 
05:30:18.708 --> 05:30:18.718 align:start position:0%
three long session days at in the middle
 
05:30:21.270 --> 05:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
of March at the end of March no we're
 
05:30:23.350 --> 05:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid that I understand that
 
05:30:25.990 --> 05:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
um but we've had two hearings now that
 
05:30:29.390 --> 05:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
have had to be stopped early because so
 
05:30:31.830 --> 05:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
many people have shown up so I I just
 
05:30:35.030 --> 05:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know at what point do we balance
 
05:30:37.070 --> 05:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
moving these bills out of our committee
 
05:30:39.190 --> 05:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
with with hearing what people have to
 
05:30:42.310 --> 05:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:44.990 --> 05:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
them it's typically what happens is you
 
05:30:47.270 --> 05:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
just do that on a case-by Case basis
 
05:30:49.868 --> 05:30:49.878 align:start position:0%
like I had no idea that HB 1700 was
 
05:30:53.910 --> 05:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
going to be oh I knew that I didn't
 
05:30:57.590 --> 05:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
because the sponsors never contacted me
 
05:30:59.350 --> 05:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh in fact I got a telephone call from
 
05:31:01.030 --> 05:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
one of the sponsors
 
05:31:03.788 --> 05:31:03.798 align:start position:0%
on uh Saturday this just this past
 
05:31:06.910 --> 05:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
Saturday saying you scheduled this bill
 
05:31:08.750 --> 05:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
for for
 
05:31:11.990 --> 05:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
Monday we need more time we're bringing
 
05:31:15.110 --> 05:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
in uh people to testify from Texas you
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
got to give us more time and I said to
 
05:31:20.110 --> 05:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
that person well you didn't call me
 
05:31:22.628 --> 05:31:22.638 align:start position:0%
ahead of time I had no idea that there
 
05:31:25.150 --> 05:31:25.160 align:start position:0%
was some kind of a time constraint on
 
05:31:26.910 --> 05:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:31:29.750 --> 05:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm doing the best I can but I'm not
 
05:31:32.750 --> 05:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
perfect I make uh judgments judgment
 
05:31:34.350 --> 05:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
calls and sometimes they're right
 
05:31:36.310 --> 05:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're not that's all I can
 
05:31:39.270 --> 05:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
say y thank
 
05:31:43.310 --> 05:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
you Vice chair Thomas yes uh also should
 
05:31:47.270 --> 05:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
we should we finish earlier than normal
 
05:31:49.868 --> 05:31:49.878 align:start position:0%
uh and we have enough time to work on
 
05:31:51.990 --> 05:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
these bills and we may have extra time
 
05:31:53.788 --> 05:31:53.798 align:start position:0%
maybe if we have to schedule more time
 
05:31:57.628 --> 05:31:57.638 align:start position:0%
for them being upfront allows us to be
 
05:31:59.830 --> 05:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
able to go later on to cover bills that
 
05:32:03.030 --> 05:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
may we need more time but in addition by
 
05:32:05.590 --> 05:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
somewhat finishing early when we can
 
05:32:07.430 --> 05:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
gives us opportunity perhaps to have
 
05:32:12.110 --> 05:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
some presentations here uh which are
 
05:32:14.708 --> 05:32:14.718 align:start position:0%
long we haven't had the ones that we
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
normally had to have pre pandemic and so
 
05:32:19.230 --> 05:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
this gives us an opportunity now to to
 
05:32:22.110 --> 05:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
hear things that normally even freshman
 
05:32:23.430 --> 05:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
here would have
 
05:32:25.990 --> 05:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
heard representative MC
 
05:32:27.910 --> 05:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
Williams thank you so much for the
 
05:32:30.590 --> 05:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
information on um having house session
 
05:32:32.628 --> 05:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
Thursdays in February I noticed that the
 
05:32:35.110 --> 05:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
calendar for February actually has five
 
05:32:37.628 --> 05:32:37.638 align:start position:0%
Thursdays so do you mean that the first
 
05:32:39.590 --> 05:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
Thursday which is the 1 of February
 
05:32:41.150 --> 05:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
would be the first house session just
 
05:32:43.110 --> 05:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
for calendaring
 
05:32:47.390 --> 05:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
purposes yes the only Thursday that the
 
05:32:49.830 --> 05:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
speaker didn't want to schedule was the
 
05:32:51.670 --> 05:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
last one because that's during school
 
05:32:54.470 --> 05:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
vacation week Le here the 29th all right
 
05:32:54.480 --> 05:32:56.350 align:start position:0%
vacation week Le here the 29th all right
thank

05:32:56.350 --> 05:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:32:58.788 --> 05:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
you anything else representative
 
05:33:00.830 --> 05:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
parshall yes thank you for your work I
 
05:33:04.788 --> 05:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
first appreciate that and um I'm also
 
05:33:05.708 --> 05:33:05.718 align:start position:0%
glad that we're trying to keep the
 
05:33:08.548 --> 05:33:08.558 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House happy um is there
 
05:33:11.110 --> 05:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
any possibility of getting a little uh
 
05:33:13.390 --> 05:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
alteration of our house calendar to move
 
05:33:16.788 --> 05:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
St so we're not always last in the
 
05:33:19.510 --> 05:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
day I've been asking for that ever since
 
05:33:22.548 --> 05:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
I've been a chair and have bumped up
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
against the stone wall every time okay
 
05:33:27.470 --> 05:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's good answer not the one I want but
 
05:33:30.350 --> 05:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
so along those lines uh representative n
 
05:33:32.590 --> 05:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
made a suggestion a long time ago that
 
05:33:35.150 --> 05:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
we change our committee name to energy
 
05:33:37.628 --> 05:33:37.638 align:start position:0%
and that would solve the
 
05:33:40.190 --> 05:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
problem that's not a bad idea we would
 
05:33:42.350 --> 05:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
have to go to the rules committee
 
05:33:44.270 --> 05:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
because the names of the Committees are
 
05:33:46.548 --> 05:33:46.558 align:start position:0%
defined in rules so the the rule would
 
05:33:48.590 --> 05:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
have to be changed but maybe that's
 
05:33:50.990 --> 05:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
something we should push for um let's
 
05:33:53.070 --> 05:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
let's have that discussion at one of our
 
05:33:55.628 --> 05:33:55.638 align:start position:0%
next uh meetings representative Corman
 
05:33:57.270 --> 05:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
oh appr propo of some of what we've been
 
05:33:59.350 --> 05:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
hearing maybe we should call it Alchemy
 
05:33:59.360 --> 05:34:02.948 align:start position:0%
hearing maybe we should call it Alchemy
technology

05:34:02.948 --> 05:34:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:05.390 --> 05:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
energy then we'd always be first that's
 
05:34:08.150 --> 05:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
a good idea representative
 
05:34:10.548 --> 05:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
nter with the American legislators
 
05:34:12.868 --> 05:34:12.878 align:start position:0%
exchange Council I'm um I chair the
 
05:34:15.030 --> 05:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
communications and Technology task force
 
05:34:16.270 --> 05:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
so that would that would put us up but
 
05:34:19.548 --> 05:34:19.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:22.868 --> 05:34:22.878 align:start position:0%
so all right be thinking of creative uh
 
05:34:25.750 --> 05:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
ways to rename the committee that get us
 
05:34:28.430 --> 05:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
closer to the top of the calendar maybe
 
05:34:30.470 --> 05:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
we could push for that
 
05:34:32.788 --> 05:34:32.798 align:start position:0%
okay well everybody drive safely on your
 
05:34:35.310 --> 05:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
way home watch out for the other guy and
 
05:34:37.830 --> 05:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh take it slow and we'll see you uh
 
05:34:58.788 --> 05:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:58.798 --> 05:35:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
care
