00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to have this on right yep
 
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
um the point to this this whole bill
 
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
that's been going on now my
 
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
understanding since
 
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
2017 is that um we know that there's a
 
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
problem with pain care in the United
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
States that we have a prescription and a
 
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
procedure epidemic um but we don't
 
00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
really provide access to services that
 
00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
we think help meaning like integrative
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
care which is putting all these things
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
together in a unified piece which we
 
00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
know works for chronic disabilities that
 
00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
model works the best um but we also know
 
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
that we tell people you can't have pills
 
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
but we think you should be able to do
 
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
this this and that and the patient will
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
commonly say well I can't access that
 
00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons not the least
 
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
of which is cost so the whole point of
 
00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 align:start position:0%
this bill from the very beginning was to
 
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
provide an alternative to opioid therapy
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
the people have been asking for for a
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
long time um I think we've made some
 
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
progress but we have a long ways to go
 
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
and that was the point so the next thing
 
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
that we've been doing this has been an
 
00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
ongoing discussion that some of us in
 
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
this room have been involved with for at
 
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
least six years um and it's actually
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
what led to me running for this office
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
which is why I'm sitting here right now
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe we'll be sitting here again in
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
January hopefully
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
um I I did cheuck with my mental health
 
00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
expert and they said it was fine um but
 
00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
anyways um
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
anybody yeah a lot of people right four
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
Dems and six Republicans all together
 
00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
they can't be all they must
 
00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 align:start position:0%
be four seats for four seats yeah so um
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's going to be a
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
challenge how many
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
Democrats there's four Dems in our
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
running in our
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
our um District I think pretty much sure
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
four so they they they won't have a
 
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
primary they they did that on purpose I
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
I actually work with them on a regular
 
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
basis on a lot of stuff so I know the
 
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
inside dirt but the Republicans there
 
00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:49.879 align:start position:0%
were two new ones that chose to
 
00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
run um we'll see I'm not as confident as
 
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
you are but anyway so that that's kind
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
of where we are with this bill I I um I
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
think the bill needs a lot of work um I
 
00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759 align:start position:0%
tried to put together something that
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
I've shared with all of you um and I
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
would be happy to start anywhere um
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer and I talked in
 
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
the cafeteria earlier and I don't know
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
how much you want me to go over the
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
history of this before we get into
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
that all right so um actually I
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
met um M croll and Miss Don like as part
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
of this process about Gary Merchant
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
several year representative Gary
 
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
Merchant uh several years ago um put
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
together an ad hoc committee to look at
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
how we provide nonopioid Therapies in
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
the state and um I don't think there was
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
a clear Direction Where We wanted that
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
to go but I was actually kind of not
 
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
totally invited to that um um I was
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
actually supposed to go to a different
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee but Jim Potter asked me to
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
attend on behalf of the med Society so I
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
went and when I sat down when I realized
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
that not a single person in the room
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
knew what the CDC guidelines to opio
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
prescribing was I knew that there was a
 
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
problem so I immediately gave a
 
00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:13.079 align:start position:0%
discussion on that and um the next thing
 
00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
I know is Gary Merchant says you
 
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be out there you should be up
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
here so the next thing I know when you
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
were there too and I I I got asked to go
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
sit up there and Peter Schmidt came
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
later and whatever um but anyways um it
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
was a really great process um that
 
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
committee led to three bills um one of
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
which passed which is one that I wrote
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
with um uh ironically Bill Murphy on no
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
relation um but it changed the way we we
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
allow prescribing opioids in the state
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
which helped patients which is a good
 
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
thing um but anyways in the midst of all
 
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
that um representative maputi was there
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
at several meetings and she was talking
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
about a bill that she wanted to create
 
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
um she's that basically is what the
 
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
first two sections of this bill are or
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
three sections I think um the ones that
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
are all bleed
 
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
out so um you know it was the problem
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
with the bill was it made sense it
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to increase access to these
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
services but it put in a lot of
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions on doctors who prescribe
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
and so that raised a lot of warning
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
signs for us because to be honest
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
everything that was in that section was
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
already in our rules so um we met
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
together as a separate ad hoc group um
 
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
San Savage me Jim Potter Mike padmore
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
and Cindy Steinberg U the reason why
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
Cindy is important is she is a
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
legislative director for the US pain
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
foundation and the Executive Vice
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
President for the Massachusetts pain
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
initiative she's been involved in
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
National pain policy for over 20 years
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
and there was a similar Bill crafted in
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that she was the author of
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
so she and I've been friends for a long
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
time and I asked her up and get involved
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
and advise us so a lot of what you're
 
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
seeing in the second section the part
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
that's not bed out in this is the work
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
that we all did together um we all
 
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
agreed something needed a change um how
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
purpose of that was that existing law um
 
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.710 align:start position:0%
purpose of that was that existing law um
not

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
really wonder why I've never seen that
 
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
before seen a different color oh oh
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
that's me that's you that's me so
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
anything that's blue is an edit from the
 
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
original Bill okay yeah because I've
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
never seen that before oh yeah I
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
normally it's red but my printer
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do red for some reason when it
 
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
came email you got it in red my printer
 
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
it in blue don't I have no idea why my
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
printer yeah so um so basically anything
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
in blue that's struck out is something
 
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
that's been taken out of the bill that
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
was in the original bill um anything
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
that's in blue that's not struck out as
 
00:12:00.639 --> 00:12:01.389 align:start position:0%
that's in blue that's not struck out as
an

00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
addition um so anyway so that's kind of
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
how we came down to this um you know the
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
way they did it in Massachusetts was I
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
mean there was a lot of discussion um
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
between insurers between
 
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
providers um and they came to some
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
conclusions that that basically mandated
 
00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
insurers had to provide a plan on how
 
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
they provide um integrative services for
 
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
pain care that they had to provide so
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
many visits for I think it was like one
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
particular modality that they could
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
choose um and they they gave a basically
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
the same things that are in this bill
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
the same options you know whether it was
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
movement therapies manual therapies
 
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
what's important to realize is we're not
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
talking about physical therapy we're not
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
talking about occupational therapy we're
 
00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:48.519 align:start position:0%
not talking about anything that's
 
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
already covered um well um so anything
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
that's not covered well that's provide
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
and this was the other thing that became
 
00:12:58.269 --> 00:12:58.279 align:start position:0%
very important our discussions because
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
the original bill includes ta Chi Yoga
 
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
chiong things like that the reason why
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
those were struck is those are not
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
provided by licensed providers so we
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
came to the conclusion based on a
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
discussion with insurers as well that
 
00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
the only thing that made any sense from
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
a legislative point of view was that it
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
had to be provided by a licensed
 
00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
sort yes and to be honest those those
 
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
words we can put back in here I I
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
struggle with those words but um they
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
they actually were in here and taken out
 
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
um um I struggle with those words
 
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
because right now if you look at the
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
agency for healthc care research quality
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
report on back pain there's virtually
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
nothing that
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
supports anything for back pain so
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's when evidence gets kind of
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
sketchy with the exception of um two
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
things um lumbar epidural corro
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
injection for short-term relief for um
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
radicular pain and back surgery for
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
ridic back pain those are the only
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
things that have any evidence that that
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
meet met their level with that said
 
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
there's an acupuncture project that
 
00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:11.959 align:start position:0%
lists 117 different diagnoses for which
 
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
there's some element of evidence there's
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
plenty of evidence for cognitive
 
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
behavioral therapy for treatment of pain
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
um there is evidence for massage there
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
is definitely one of the things that was
 
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
presented to our integrative Pain Care
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
committee from Amy Goldstein from the
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
alliance to advance comprehensive
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
integrative pain management was there's
 
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
actually strong evidence that um
 
00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:33.759 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic is cost effective for acute
 
00:14:33.759 --> 00:14:34.509 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic is cost effective for acute
back

00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:34.519 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
pain um there's the most cost effective
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
intervention for acute back pain um so
 
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
um so yes that we probably should throw
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
evidence base back in there in
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere um but to me I think we kind
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
of Def need to Define it because I think
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
we use that term a lot without ever
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm pretty much done I think with
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
the history so um yeah let's let's just
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
have people talk and we have three
 
00:15:13.749 --> 00:15:13.759 align:start position:0%
guests in the audience um that are
 
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:27.949 align:start position:0%
 
wishm

00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
bever is that the underl yeah with the
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
other with that said we do need to
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
Define What alternative therapies means
 
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
if we're going to put that word in
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
there so is this is this driven by
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
insurance is it driven by reimbursement
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
okay it's driven by a lot of separate
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders so I've met I mean as part
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
of what I do I meet with people all over
 
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
the country in different disciplines so
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
I've met with massage people Psych
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
people like people um chiropractors I
 
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
met with actually both of the State
 
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic agencies I actually work
 
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
with the acupuncture Association so
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
we've met with all of them they they're
 
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
the ones that are driving this when I
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
gave you the history what I was trying
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
to do was give
 
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
people's um position on this as best as
 
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
simple so I'm glad you said that
 
00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:56.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
obious can I help you with that so we we
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
have a an an in house bill 66 now 1712
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
created a committee that look at Pilot
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
programs and I do want to stress that I
 
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
think what we're doing here is different
 
00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:20.039 align:start position:0%
than that I'd be happy to address that
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
if anybody wants me to but our first
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
session we spent the entire session
 
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
coming up with a d def um definition the
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
pain the definition that's actually in
 
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
this here if you look down at the lower
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
sections pain is defined there but it's
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
using the International Association for
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
the study of pain definition the only
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
minor problem with that and I think we
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
should modify that to use the same
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
definition that we used in the
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
integrative Pain Care committee um but
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
it it the definition actually appears
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
twice in the bill um I can find it for
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
you but I really do think we should use
 
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:01.640 align:start position:0%
the definition that we came up with that
 
00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:04.039 align:start position:0%
representative McKay was a huge help in
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
helping us with because he said exactly
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
said yeah it's the definition if you
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
look at our report that I actually do
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
have here um if you look at our report
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
um we defined it there it's not actually
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
bill and so at this point it does not
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
appear in
 
00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:57.549 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
yep yeah the those definitions actually
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
came from Cindy Steinberg so that's what
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
they use in Massachusetts um and that's
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
what they use nationally but I I based
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
on our discussions I mean this went on
 
00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
for two
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
hours um you know we came I'm sorry I
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
have the this is the actual report I'll
 
00:19:20.149 --> 00:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
I'll send you a copy of the actual
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
definition that we have that we used but
 
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's the International Association
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
of the study of pain met again um within
 
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
the last couple years is redefine pain
 
00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
um and um it's it's broader it's more
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
biopsychosocial um um but it it was
 
00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
really more gerine to what we wanted to
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
do with that committee and what this
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
bill and that committee do does overlaps
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
a lot in that
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
help so
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
Avail the
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
y so my this is what I'd like to do I
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to start a discussion I wanted we
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't even need to go over in detail
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
what I did here if you don't want um
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
which is fine and we can look at it what
 
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
I would like to do is put together if
 
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
that's all right with you guys um
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
because this worked really well for our
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
prior authorization process and also a
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
couple other things we've done is put
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
together a small group of people that
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
represent multiple stakeholders not just
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
one um and sit down look at this and
 
00:20:48.669 --> 00:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
come up with something that um I be
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
honest I really do think we need to move
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
with this I I don't want to kill this um
 
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
but I want to do something that I think
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
satisfactory from a lot of different
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
perspectives and what I wrote here to me
 
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
is a starting point um and I I I was
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
under the impression that we needed to
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
have this done in the next week I found
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
out we don't so we have the whole summer
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
to work on it but I mean if if that's if
 
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
that's okay with people here that's what
 
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
I would like to do um and then have
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
everybody sit down look at it see what
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
they think um I will tell you that the
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that I've referred to
 
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
there's not a unanimous belief on this
 
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
bill at all all like I I'm on the
 
00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
legislative committee for the American
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
of medical acupuncture and I asked him I
 
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
says why the hell would you want to do
 
00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
this and I said you know right now it's
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
all cash and a lot of the old school
 
00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic is Cash massage is Cash
 
00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:48.039 align:start position:0%
which means you don't have an electronic
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
record you don't need one you certainly
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
don't have to have an expensive one that
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
TI and with other systems um you don't
 
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
have to get prior authorizations you
 
00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
don't have any of those headaches and
 
00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:00.279 align:start position:0%
you can charge a reasonable price and do
 
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
what you like to do without any
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
stress and um about half of them will
 
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
say that's what I want the other half
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
says they want insurance coverage
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
because it gives them access to
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
populations they don't have access to
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
now meaning lower income people things
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
like that the other little Minor Detail
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
or problem that you guys have pointed
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
out multiple times what we're doing here
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
only affects 22% of the insurance market
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
and that's a problem and um um um you
 
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
know especially when you're looking at
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
lower income people that group of people
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
you're looking really more at Medicaid
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
Medicare um you know especially people
 
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
with disabilities they're going to have
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
potentially both insurances or maybe
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
more likely Medicare than
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but we don't have any effect on
 
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
that we don't have this bill does not
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
address the self-insured market either
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's like 78% of the market and that's
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
a problem and I totally understand why
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
the ERS have a problem with that is
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
because you know you're you're basically
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
limiting it to one small group and and
 
00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
that's why they have an issue I'm
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
speaking for you guys sorry but that is
 
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
you feel free to say something if you
 
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:49.710 align:start position:0%
you feel free to say something if you
wish

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
you you can hear me all right right yeah
 
00:23:56.679 --> 00:24:01.190 align:start position:0%
you you can hear me all right right yeah
okay

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
I I had no idea we're online oh God I
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.549 --> 00:24:11.559 align:start position:0%
with go
 
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
ahead my interest uh is in mental health
 
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
and uh as as you probably all know
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
middle illnesses are
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
misunderstood and U often uh antagonist
 
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
towards those
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
individuals uh I'm retired now but
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
there's a neighbor of mine who comes
 
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
over to see me and he's very concerned
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
about the people that live with him are
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
poisoning his
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
food and U and uh and he finds that very
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
disturbing uh so he takes all of the
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
food puts it in his
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
car and uh now everybody is thinking
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
this man is very
 
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:09.559 align:start position:0%
strange and instead of the fact that
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
he's severely mentally
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
ill um all I can do is to say when
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
you're upset come and talk to me and see
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
if we can't uh work this
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
out uh he's been a homeless person uh uh
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
he has addictions uh he's got medical
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
marijuana which have got him into
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
trouble at work because he has the
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana in a package in his
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
pocket and the people at work want to
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
know what's in his pocket and I said
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
that's none of their
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
business uh kind of thing so that um
 
00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:00.279 align:start position:0%
people don't think so much about the
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
issue of pain and Mental Illness but
 
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
it's been my
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
experience I was just telling my friend
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
here that I had a patient that came to
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
me she was very angry with me as to how
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
incompetent I was and she was screaming
 
00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.710 align:start position:0%
incompetent I was and she was screaming
and

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
hollering and she said
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
your confidence is about as important as
 
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
she rattled off a number
 
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
and I said can you think about that
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
number turned out to be her
 
00:26:33.159 --> 00:26:34.669 align:start position:0%
number turned out to be her
grandfather's

00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
grandfather's
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
birthday and it turned out that she was
 
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.710 align:start position:0%
birthday and it turned out that she was
sexually

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
sexually
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
molested as a child by that grandfather
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
she had carried that hate probably for
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
50 years and that's what I was
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
experiencing was that hate uh based on
 
00:26:59.230 --> 00:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
that experience it was very um uh
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
enlightening uh for me uh to hear what
 
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
she had to say uh because it was clear
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
that what she was
 
00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:11.559 align:start position:0%
carrying was was
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
unresolved hate towards that grandfather
 
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
that could never be
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
experienced so it was a unique
 
00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
experience uh for me um to recognize
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
that the importance of that the hate
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
part of uh mental illness so I think
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
what Dave is doing is very
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
important if if somewhat unique in his
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
approach I'd love to tell you it's mine
 
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of people involved in
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
this discussion yeah I meant your unique
 
00:27:53.509 --> 00:27:53.519 align:start position:0%
approach to legislation oh
 
00:27:57.149 --> 00:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
okay I actually I I wanted to know yeah
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%

representative Nagel has reached out um
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
a number of bills a number of occasions
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
so we definitely appreciate the the back
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
and forth dialogue and the um
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work on this um there's a
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
a handout here which I know I sent to um
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel and I'm happy to
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
send it around to others we
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
preped um two I think it was two years
 
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
ago when we were um there's an ad hoc
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
committee that was working on this issue
 
00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
and so I just wanted to call your
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
attention to it on the first page so
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
it's just a one page two-sided document
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
but on the first page it does kind of go
 
00:29:05.509 --> 00:29:05.519 align:start position:0%
over the information again it's it's
 
00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
slightly dated but I think it you know
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
generally representative of where things
 
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.039 align:start position:0%
stand today as well um just kind of
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
about the different markets and again
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
just a reminder that um any legislation
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
that um is put into state law relative
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
to insurance coverage mandates um can
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
only apply to the fully insured um
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
commercial market so it's as
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel um correctly
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
pointed out it's it's not the
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
self-funded it's not Medicaid it's not
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare um and then within that fully
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
insured Market there's the individual
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
market and then there's the employer
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
sponsored Health Plan market so um and
 
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
often the state um does not apply
 
00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:51.559 align:start position:0%
mandates to the individual Market
 
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
because um there could potentially be a
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
state Li a financial liability um
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
associated with that um through the ACA
 
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
so I it's just something to important to
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
keep in mind because I think um we need
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
to remember um that there are businesses
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
mediumsized businesses out out there
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
that are you know continue to struggle
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
to to even afford to pay for health
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage um for their
 
00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:23.559 align:start position:0%
employees and so we just um want to
 
00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
always keep in mind about who's going to
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
be paying the premiums um and you know
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
typically employers or perhaps employers
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
and employees shared so um to keep that
 
00:30:38.909 --> 00:30:38.919 align:start position:0%
in mind um and the other side of this
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
page um and I think it's probably again
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
still um
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative perhaps there are some
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
updates but generally speaking um what
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
the um plan the carriers were covering
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
in standard plans um and again it's
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
important to remember there's a whole
 
00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
variety of um
 
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
benefit coverage benefits that carriers
 
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
offer um to try to have a variety of
 
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
offerings and choices in the market for
 
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
employers and individuals um and so
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
there's you know there's a lot of
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
variability but um looking at sign kind
 
00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
of some standard plans you can see that
 
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
chiropractic Services PT and OT 10 units
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
um all typically covered um acupuncture
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
coverage conveyor vary so there are some
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
plans that may cover it but not all
 
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:34.039 align:start position:0%
necessarily um gym reimbursement again
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
um same situation and massage um can be
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
covered if it's part of covered Cairo PT
 
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
or OT but not um as a standalone
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
typically um and then meditation again
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
not covered um but a number of the
 
00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:54.919 align:start position:0%
carriers provide resources on their
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
website that's available not just to
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
their members but really to anybody you
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
can access it without a log in or
 
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
anything like that and um that provided
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
a couple of links here that would get
 
00:32:08.509 --> 00:32:08.519 align:start position:0%
you to um kind of meditation and
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
mindfulness um resources that the
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
carriers do make available so um I just
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of make sure it sounds
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
like you all have that page but I wanted
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure um that you had a chance to
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just looking over my notes
 
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:34.039 align:start position:0%
um you know we one of the things that we
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
were concerned about um a couple of
 
00:32:39.149 --> 00:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
concerns um there were 18 Services
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
listed and I haven't gone back to
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
compare and see if there are still 18
 
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
Services listed um when it was qualified
 
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
by the phrase including but not limited
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
to so which would indicate that there
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
was an unknown number of other services
 
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
you know beyond those listed um and I
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
think I saw the number 12 um as you know
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
coverage of a minimum number of visits
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
um for each of the services so that
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
would be on every single plan and so one
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
of the concerns we had raised during the
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
testimony um when this Bill had a public
 
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
hearing is that that that could put
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
upward pressure on the premiums and I
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
think that there was a fiscal note to
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
the bill although I didn't see it um
 
00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I didn't see it either yeah so I'm
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
not sure where that where that landed um
 
00:33:26.909 --> 00:33:26.919 align:start position:0%
the thing I saw said that unknown okay
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
is what I saw
 
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
um so can I just address that one thing
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
because that's important what you just
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
said so I did qualify and what I wrote
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
here was that you could pick 12 as a
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
starting point 12 visits from each
 
00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
category not from every service within
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
that category okay okay I mean that's a
 
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
start I agree with you if this there's
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
innumerable Pain Care interventions I
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
mean you you could go on forever we do
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
need to put a limit right yeah yeah and
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
I know um representative that you
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned Massachusetts um the
 
00:33:59.629 --> 00:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts law and so I don't have it
 
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
right in front of me but um from notes I
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
have here um in Massachusetts the
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
carriers um are required to ensure that
 
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
they cover at least two alternative
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
medication treatment options um so it's
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
the medication side and at least three
 
00:34:20.589 --> 00:34:20.599 align:start position:0%
alternative non-medication treatment
 
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
modalities um so my understanding is
 
00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:24.470 align:start position:0%
modalities um so my understanding is
it's

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
non-prescriptive um so you know that um
 
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
and of course there's you know
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
utilization management review and
 
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
medical necessity that um overlays on
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
that or or underpins it um so anyway you
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
know the Massachusetts law is certainly
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
something we could look at if if that's
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
of interest to you um and then the other
 
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
um thing I was going to mention um and I
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
think it's come up in the house bill 66
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
um work um but it was something we
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
raised in our testimony as well is just
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
um also looking for the opportunities
 
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
around starting with education for um
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
providers both pcps and other types of
 
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
providers about the alternatives to
 
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
opioids um so less of a mandate but more
 
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
just focusing on some education um and
 
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
information um aspects of this as well
 
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
so um and then the final thing I'll say
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
which you've probably heard me say
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
before is that you know coverage
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
Services should always be um
 
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um they should be you
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
know based on clinical and scientific
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
ific evidence um and so you know we want
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that's part of the
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
conversation as well
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
um and I know you said you wanted to
 
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
work on this you know in the coming
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
weeks and months and so we're happy to
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know continue to get information to
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
you but I just want to kind of give you
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
a few touch points um while we're
 
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
kicking off the discussion today my only
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
goal on that was ruin in your
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
summer so um representative Palmer
 
00:35:58.589 --> 00:35:58.599 align:start position:0%
repres so yeah my question sort of
 
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
related to this and maybe we this is
 
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:02.200 align:start position:0%
information maybe we need to get which
 
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
is um I mean with concerns about upper
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
pressure on premiums what's happened in
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts with their with their bill
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
has that been a problem or are we
 
00:36:16.829 --> 00:36:16.839 align:start position:0%
substituting one modality for for pain
 
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
meds and so overall it's actually not
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
costing anymore and maybe it's better
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
for patients and so that kind of
 
00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
information I mean for me that would be
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
very valuable and I mean I completely
 
00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:28.599 align:start position:0%
agree that these that the treatments we
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
do include need to be evidence-based
 
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
because otherwise you you
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
know I can answer that if you want do
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
you mind I I can this be a discussion
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
more than like a yeah yeah you're
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
running the show um however
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
you did you want to I want to ask a
 
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
question of the insurance people
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
um from a provider perspective you know
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
forget about the premium cost forget
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
about the covered items forget about the
 
00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
number of times that you can see a
 
00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.589 align:start position:0%
number of times that you can see a
certain

00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
provider if in general now what I'm
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
trying to do is get at a very simple
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
concept number one we want to provide
 
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
access for patients that really need the
 
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
care for whatever reason whether the
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
mentally ill whether they're poor
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
whether they're rich whether they have
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
insurance or not we want to get access
 
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
to care right tell me if you agree with
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
these principles if the treatment is
 
00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:26.839 align:start position:0%
effective meaning evidence-based so
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
we've proven that that the whatever
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
treatment we're talking about
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
Works provided that the the people given
 
00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.430 align:start position:0%
Works provided that the the people given
the

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:40.109 --> 00:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
um uh modality whatever it might be are
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
licensed within the state and that's
 
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
where it becomes a legislative
 
00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.710 align:start position:0%
where it becomes a legislative
issue

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
um as far as I'm concerned would the
 
00:37:51.309 --> 00:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
insurance companies cover that meaning
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
that would they be supportive of any
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that basically
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
says you know if it's an accepted
 
00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
provider license if it is an accepted
 
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
modality if it is proven to be effective
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
um and as far as I'm concerned if
 
00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
somebody then wants to pay cash for
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
whatever treatment they want whether
 
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
it's you know eating herbs in the garden
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
or whether it's you know whatever it
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
might be that's fine with me but once
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
you step into the insurance realm then
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
you have issues regarding you know lure
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
accessibility um
 
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
and whether or not it's effective or not
 
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
is it is it your opinion that the
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
insurance companies would support that
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
sort of a concept so what I can say is I
 
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
think those are two principles that we
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
certainly would agree to I I don't I put
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
off few so what are the two that you
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned oh you mentioned um
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
evidence-based and licensed so th I'm
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
I'm honing in on those two things so I I
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
would agree with you that those are two
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
principles that we would agree to I
 
00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
don't know what necessarily our ex
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
exhaustive list might be of kind of
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
criteria or whatever but I would agree
 
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
with you that those are two key because
 
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
you know meditation you know you you
 
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
talked about meditation being effective
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
or Mind Body yeah whatever Mind Body
 
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
okay so if it was proven if the massage
 
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
was proven to be effective would it be
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
covered by
 
00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:17.319 align:start position:0%
Insurance So currently massage is
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
covered if it's part of like OT PT Cairo
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
or some other um piece let's say that
 
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
they're not PT licensed they are massage
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
licensed I don't it from what I
 
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
understood from the survey that we did
 
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
two years ago of the carriers that would
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
not be covered so um me me going me
 
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
going down to Elements Massage um so for
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
my very very simple you know orthop is a
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
very simple minded you know you got pain
 
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
you want to have a procedure or you want
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
to have a modality that's effective you
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
then want to have the people that given
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
it like Ed then as far as I'm concerned
 
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
the insurance can cover it okay and if
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
they don't I don't understand why okay
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
so my my question is going to be and
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
this not you know slam on insurance it
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
would be any of these you
 
00:40:16.349 --> 00:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
know um massage or whatever meditation
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
whatever if it works I don't care you
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
know I we we do we do too many
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
procedures that are not effective you
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
know and I've seen that so I'm very much
 
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
aware aware of you know having you know
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
treatments that are effective and you
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
know proven to be so to be covered
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's all I would care about and that's
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
what I would want to know that the
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
insurance cover that go ahead right well
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
and I go ahead and then I'll say what
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
and and I'm thinking like one of the
 
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
problems we have is um Pain
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
Services are very interested in doing
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
procedures because they're very well
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursed right but not as interested
 
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
in in helping us sort out the the root
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
cause somebody's pain and what other
 
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
treatments might help them and um so
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
part of the part part of what I'm I
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
guess getting at is if we expand in one
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
way um does that reduce costs in another
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
way that balances out and is actually
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
better for the patient I think the the
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
the big issue that's always been
 
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
problematic for me in all these
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
discussions is that we apply one set of
 
00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
evidence criteria for one group of
 
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
people meaning allopathic doctors and
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
then we apply a totally different uh
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
standard for non-allopathic
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
doctors and so you know like the bar for
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
like in North I I gu I remember when
 
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
they did pedicle screws and and the bar
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
for degenerative spine there's virtually
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
no evidence to support it but they they
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
they were able to get that with FDA
 
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
approval very easily without any really
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
significant evidence and you know what
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about well sure A year later
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
there the two years years later the
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
level above the fusion mass is now
 
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
sympatic right yeah so I mean that's the
 
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
problem that I had was that well when
 
00:42:07.309 --> 00:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist you know the the
 
00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
Acupuncture Project has 117 different
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
diagnoses with evidence and why is that
 
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
not good enough but to get to what
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer said
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
um this is my goal is to save everybody
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
money is is you know when I looked and
 
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
did the math on how many acupuncture
 
00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:28.359 align:start position:0%
treatments I could do on a patient and
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
for the same price as one epidural
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
injection in in an or it was something
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
like 60 you know and and I was like I've
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
never done 60 acupuncture treatments on
 
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
anybody you know and I follow one lady
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
for 30 years you know and um um um I I
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
think that what what everybody's getting
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
at is we want a uniform evidence-based
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
criteria if there is evidence that
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
something works and especially I think
 
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:57.640 align:start position:0%
we're trying to save you guys money I at
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
the end you and the premiums and the the
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
people that are getting it I mean to me
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's the end game and and to answer
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
your question about Massachusetts I
 
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
don't think we have an answer yet but I
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
could ask Cindy how that worked out what
 
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
I will say is that their bill started
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
out looking exactly like this bill did
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
the bill that's in is what happened
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process okay so
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
yeah can I make a couple comments thank
 
00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
you I'm Sabrina D I represent Anthem
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
Blue Cross Blue Shield um so just a
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
couple of off the cup thoughts in
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
response um to your comments so I think
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
we generally start from a place of
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
wanting something that's less invasive
 
00:43:40.589 --> 00:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
and lower cost so conceptually aligned
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
there and I think when you start talking
 
00:43:45.549 --> 00:43:45.559 align:start position:0%
about things like massage therapy they
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
might be licensed massage therapists but
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
what kind of evidence are we talking
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
about and if you get sort of outside the
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
medical evidence realm I mean I love
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
going to have a nice massage but if it's
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
not for a medical reason I mean should
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
that be covered by insurance I think
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's debatable um and then you get
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
into you can mandate you know coverage
 
00:44:09.309 --> 00:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
of a service like massage therapy but
 
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:11.079 align:start position:0%
then we get into the issue of networks
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
we can't force providers to come into
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
our Network and we've run into this with
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
providers like acupuncturists I think
 
00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.230 align:start position:0%
providers like acupuncturists I think
maybe

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
chiropractors um physical therapists and
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
so there's the issue of of having people
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
in your network because if they're not
 
00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
in our Network then you know it's it's
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
not really
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
it's an issue because then they're not
 
00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
contracted with us and so it's not
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
really helpful for our members so I just
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out sort of those
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
practical issues and I understand like
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
conceptually I think we're probably
 
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
aligned but I think when you start to
 
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
peel back the layers it's a little more
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
complicated than just saying okay if it
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
works we should cover it so do you mind
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
so you mind I ask a question you know I
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
would I would argue that invasive does
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
not necessarily mean it is you want to
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
go to the the least invasive first so if
 
00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
you have a a fractured femur you know
 
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
doing massage therapy is not going to
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
work period right we know that unless
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
you're a baby and you know stuff like
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
that we don't fix him but you know so
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
less invasive you know may be the best
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
way to go and the most coste effective
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
down the road because you're done with
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
the you've done you're dealt with the
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
problem and you're done with it um but
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
having said that you know what I'm
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
saying is that you know I I would push
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
back a little bit on the premise that if
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's less invasive we want to start
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
there first I would I would argue
 
00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
against that um and that's not from a
 
00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
surgical point of view that's just from
 
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
what is the best way to treat that
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
patient at that point in time and who's
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
the best person to do it so to me really
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
it comes down to it's you know what is
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis what is the proven
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
effective therapies who is licensed to
 
00:45:47.549 --> 00:45:47.559 align:start position:0%
provide that therapy and as far as I'm
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
concerned it should be a covered product
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
now whether or not they're in your
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
network or not that's up to the provider
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
to decide if they choose not to do it
 
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
and they want to take cash because
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
they're good at what they do and there's
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that in hospitals in New
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
York City that will take cash in fact
 
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
that's the only way the way they will do
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
the practices to take cash and why
 
00:46:08.589 --> 00:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
because it's a status symbol it's a
 
00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
status symbol to say you know I will
 
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
do you know this procedure but I'll only
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
take cash because I don't want to deal
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
with the enems the signas the Blue Cross
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
Blue Shields of the world so um again
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
you know you know you're coming up from
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
an insurance perspective I'm coming at
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
it from a patient care perspective and
 
00:46:33.549 --> 00:46:33.559 align:start position:0%
to me it's a little bit different well
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
we are also coming at it from a what's
 
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
best for our members perspective and I
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
just on this issue of Licensing we we
 
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
can't functionally just base bringing
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
providers or or they're not even really
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
providers just people who provide a
 
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
service into Network simply because
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
they're licensed I mean that would be a
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
massive array of professions that are
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
licensed so we really I mean we're
 
00:46:59.790 --> 00:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
health insurance so it has to be medical
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
and I think I think the jury's still out
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
on massage therapy I mean I think I I'm
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
not aware of of like medical evidence um
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
that it sort of treats or helps certain
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
illnesses or what you know diagnoses and
 
00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe that is out there but I
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
think we we cannot just have it hinge on
 
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.069 align:start position:0%
think we we cannot just have it hinge on
licensing

00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
alone can I ask that a question to that
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
so we apply both of those things
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
evidence-based plus license does that
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
make a difference
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
I think so yeah I mean we have to have
 
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
the medical evidence and and it's been a
 
00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:33.559 align:start position:0%
while since I've talked to Dr laflor our
 
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
medical our chief medical director um
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
and again a lot of this is like I'm
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
digging deep because it's been a few
 
00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
months since we've talked about these
 
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
issues but yeah I mean I think those
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
things go hand in hand sorry I yeah and
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
like I like I said I I think that those
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
are two key aspects but I don't know
 
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
that it's the exhaustive list so yeah
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so my primary goal is to patients
 
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
have access to the right Care at the
 
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
right time by the right person period so
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
to me you make you you apply the kiss
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
principle to the bill the legislature
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
that is put forward you make it as
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
simple as possible and if what we're
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
talking about is having you know for
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
mental health issues for True pain for
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
whatever the issue is you have the right
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
therapy that is proven to be effective
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
given by the person that is the best to
 
00:48:27.549 --> 00:48:27.559 align:start position:0%
give that then it for my line thinking
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
that is the the the end goal of the bill
 
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
um from what I can see from what I look
 
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
at and if somebody wants to pay cash
 
00:48:38.829 --> 00:48:38.839 align:start position:0%
knock yourself out but you know they may
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
not be included you know within your
 
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.589 align:start position:0%
not be included you know within your
network

00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
network
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
because the the modality is not
 
00:48:46.319 --> 00:48:47.829 align:start position:0%
because the the modality is not
considered

00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
a um proven effective treatment but they
 
00:48:53.549 --> 00:48:53.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to do it anyway so they pay cash
 
00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:57.319 align:start position:0%
let them pay cash um good job um that's
 
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
perfect that's exactly what I what you
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
were getting at before was the idea that
 
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
if you say couldn't find chiropractors
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
to join your networker because they're
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
too happy just taking the cash would
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
would the insurance company be penalized
 
00:49:15.069 --> 00:49:15.079 align:start position:0%
and so there has to be some work end for
 
00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
that um I totally agree I I I'll be
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
honest when I went through this bill
 
00:49:21.069 --> 00:49:21.079 align:start position:0%
last night and I rewrote it and I
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
re-edited and things like that that was
 
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
one thing that jumped out at me was that
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
whole issue of you have to have this
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
many providers for each of these
 
00:49:33.069 --> 00:49:33.079 align:start position:0%
Services I I I didn't like that and that
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed but that that's what
 
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
was in the bill um I had a question that
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
I don't really understand that maybe all
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
of you can help me with so you talked
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
about the whole mandate issue and things
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
like that what I struggle to understand
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
is when when we started with this bill
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
we just started with a concept and when
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
it ended up actually in writing all of a
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
sudden there was a separate sections for
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
group and indiv idual insurance but we
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
never talk about like the orisa type
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
groups the self-insure groups things
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
like that I know we can't talk about the
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
federal insured I don't know why we
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
can't talk about
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
mcos um um maybe you can clarify for
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
that but why are they not included in
 
00:50:15.069 --> 00:50:15.079 align:start position:0%
that discussion because we're basically
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
throwing out
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
about probably about 30 to 40% of the
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
market for reasons I don't
 
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
understand so
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
the simply the way are the regulatory
 
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
structure works um at the state level
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
what the New Hampshire insurance
 
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
department has the authority to regulate
 
00:50:40.109 --> 00:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
is the fully insured plans both in the
 
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
individual market and in the the
 
00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
employer Market the group Market um so
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
the self-funded plans for example are
 
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
regulated at the federal level um
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is a completely separate set of
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
statutes obviously having federal and
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
state um um partnership there um
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
Medicare Federal um so you know one of
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
the other things that that we had talked
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
about is the the work that's going on in
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
the house bill 66 um um committee your
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
study committee or working group um
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
and you know I think from our perspect
 
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:19.720 align:start position:0%
and there's a discussion there around
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
doing some pilot um some pilot work
 
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps either with the Medicaid Program
 
00:51:28.589 --> 00:51:28.599 align:start position:0%
or perhaps the state Employee Program or
 
00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
so I think there is a lot of overlap
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
with what's in here as well so
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
um that's just the lay of the land that
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
we have in terms of what we can actually
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
impact with our state laws so we like
 
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
can I mean do we I mean I don't know
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the market for
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
example in MCO like the Medicaid
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
expansion has can we have any say on
 
00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.789 align:start position:0%
expansion has can we have any say on
that

00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
too not through these statutes you would
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
have have to do it through the Medicaid
 
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
statues in in the New Hampshire so
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
there's yeah and I I'm not a Medicaid um
 
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
for the life that's not my area of
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
expertise so uh that's something you'd
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
have to talk with um somebody from HHS
 
00:52:14.589 --> 00:52:14.599 align:start position:0%
about in terms of yeah you know what
 
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
coverage they could do and then how what
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
sort of permission if any is required at
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
the federal level and that sort of thing
 
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
so and for the late me I didn't really
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
understand why we don't talk about
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
them same issues what was your initial
 
00:52:32.589 --> 00:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
concept you mentioned initial concept so
 
00:52:34.829 --> 00:52:34.839 align:start position:0%
I mean we just I mean we basically took
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
this the original bill that Cindy had
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
created for Massachusetts that's where
 
00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
all this started I mean where we started
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
was to actually look at representative L
 
00:52:44.589 --> 00:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
grin's it wasn't I guess it was his bill
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
at that time no it wasn't it was map's
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
bill at that time and we we looked at
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
that and then we modified it and came up
 
00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
with what's the second sections of this
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
bill what was the primary goal concept
 
00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
that you talked about I mean pretty much
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
everything you just said I mean we we
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to provide access to these
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
services and what we were representing
 
00:53:05.789 --> 00:53:05.799 align:start position:0%
was actually not providers but we were
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
representing patients right so it
 
00:53:10.109 --> 00:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
started with the US pain Foundation
 
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts pain initiative the New
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pain collaborative which I was
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
one of the founders of so the bill
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
actually came from those groups of
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
people with input from the medical
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
society so Physicians got involved and
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
then once that was done then we kind of
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
reached out to other groups and that how
 
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
chiropractors got involved acupuncturist
 
00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
got involved um we've never really had
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
involvement with massage people psych
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
very peripherally um um but the bill is
 
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
being written from a patient perspective
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of why I feel
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
that that this is an important
 
00:53:47.309 --> 00:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
discussion to continue because we're
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
representing the patients not the
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
providers does that
 
00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
help it does did you ever read the book
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
The said it out
 
00:53:58.789 --> 00:53:58.799 align:start position:0%
did you ever read the book called The
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
Citadel by Cronin written in
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
1939 there's one line in there at the
 
00:54:08.109 --> 00:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
very end that talks about the fact that
 
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
as soon as money got involved in health
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
care it destroyed the
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
system 1939 figure yeah well this is you
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
know this happened in 1939 so I mean it
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
was present you know for many reasons
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
but uh we faced that with rvus you know
 
00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:27.559 align:start position:0%
in the 1990s and and you knew that when
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
that happened this was going to be the
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
downfall of medicine in general but
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
having said that the the concept here
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
what we're fighting over whether it's
 
00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
Insurance language or it we're going to
 
00:54:41.309 --> 00:54:41.319 align:start position:0%
be looking at it if if I have if I have
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
any part of this it will be from the
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
patient perspective you know um and not
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
not the dollars and cents perspective so
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is that the Citadel was
 
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
present back in 39 and what I'm saying
 
00:54:59.309 --> 00:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
is that my primary goal as I think is
 
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
with chairman Nagel is the patient
 
00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
perspective you know how this care is
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
delivered Ju Ju Just so I can say um
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
having read The Sermon on the Mount this
 
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
week it that actually that statement
 
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
actually came from The Sermon on the
 
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
Mount um you can either worship God or
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
money you don't have a choice Love or
 
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
Money basically so it's been around for
 
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
and he was quoting other people so
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's a 3,000 year old concept so can I
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
just read the book resp I just want to
 
00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:33.039 align:start position:0%
say we agree and want we want what is
 
00:55:35.029 --> 00:55:35.039 align:start position:0%
best for our members always we want them
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
to be healthy we want them to have
 
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:37.720 align:start position:0%
access to whatever Healthcare is
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate we also balance that with um
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know there's a reason we have
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
networks there's a reason we have a
 
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
credentialing process um and so part of
 
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:49.960 align:start position:0%
it is making sure that the provide the
 
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
people providing the care are providing
 
00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
quality appropriate care and have all
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
the correct licensing and education
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
background Etc so um I think we come
 
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
from the same place of wanting what's
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
best for patients in our case it's our
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
members so I never asked this question
 
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
before of the insurance companies but I
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
it made me think of when you said that
 
00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
you mentioned credentialing do you do
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
privileging as well and the difference
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
is that with credentialing for a
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
hospital say is that you check the boxes
 
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
off you went to a med school you did
 
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
this you did The Residency Etc the
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
privileging is what allows you to do in
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
various hospitals the various procedures
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
that you do so I'm an orthopedist and I
 
00:56:30.029 --> 00:56:30.039 align:start position:0%
was trained to do spine but I should not
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
be privileged to do spine okay so my my
 
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
question for the insurance care is do
 
00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:37.720 align:start position:0%
you privilege you know providers in your
 
00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:40.039 align:start position:0%
network or are you just
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
credentialing I would have double check
 
00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
I I'm fairly certain the privileging is
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
on the provider like Hospital side yeah
 
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
but the insurance companies don't look
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
at that and say this providers should
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
not be doing this sort of management of
 
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.390 align:start position:0%
not be doing this sort of management of
propan

00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
propan
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
um I mean I think we we try to track
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
certain coding issues and sometimes can
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
find people are doing maybe practicing
 
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
outside the scope of what they should be
 
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
that sort of stuff that gets into a
 
00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
realm that is outside my general
 
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse but um but yeah I think
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
generally privileging is outside our our
 
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
realm okay thank
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
you I oh go ahead I want to go back try
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
to keep minutes here this is challenging
 
00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
I uh it's very important to me that
 
00:57:35.309 --> 00:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
middle illness get to be part of this
 
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
and and that's for different reasons
 
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
than what we've
 
00:57:44.109 --> 00:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
heard uh everybody knows that uh stigma
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
is a major issue in other words in the
 
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
legislature there are going to be people
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
who don't want to hear about mental
 
00:57:56.589 --> 00:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
illness because their perception
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
is the public
 
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
perception that it's
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
stigmatized and if you support mental
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
illnesses there probably something to
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
matter with you uh and also there there
 
00:58:10.079 --> 00:58:11.230 align:start position:0%
matter with you uh and also there there
is

00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage or mental illness
 
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
that's a very broad
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
spectrum uh from Neurosis to
 
00:58:25.789 --> 00:58:25.799 align:start position:0%
psychosis and some are highly treatable
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
and some are
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult to uh treat uh and
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
if you talk to the average person they
 
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
don't think of it as an illness they
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
think of it as a problem uh so that from
 
00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:46.599 align:start position:0%
my point of view anything that I can
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
associate mental illness with that
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
clearly defines it as an illness and
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
treatable uh and frankly I go back to
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
the days when the old New Hampshire
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
hospital was there and there are still
 
00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
people who believe in that that old
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
hospital you've never left there uh I've
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
had friends that were spent their whole
 
00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
life at New Hampshire hospital because
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
nobody knew what to do I was never
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
critical of that but until thorine came
 
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
there was really no
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
treatment and so I think what I'm
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
talking about is is a different type of
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
problem in terms of in inclusion in the
 
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.190 align:start position:0%
problem in terms of in inclusion in the
pain

00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
pain
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
concept but in in a strange way mental
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
illness causes pain for other people as
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
much as it causes pain in
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
individuals and therefore a very
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
different problem in terms of of
 
01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage and and who is uh
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
available uh so I keep pushing this and
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
I have for years um and I think this is
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
an unusual opportunity for people to
 
01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
begin to look at mental illness in a
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
different way and that example of how
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
somebody was carrying pain for years
 
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
untreated uh because her behavior
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
probably was provocative and uh making
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
her it's a different kind of reaction to
 
01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
pain that reaction is to be provocative
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
and irritate people instead of the the
 
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
average pain I've had some recent pain
 
01:00:57.549 --> 01:00:57.559 align:start position:0%
and frankly I don't get much Sy
 
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
from the doctor that sits next to
 
01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:05.039 align:start position:0%
me he's been I have to be honest he was
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
very helpful to me at a difficult time
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
he saw that I could aride home every
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
single so lot nicer than representative
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
M representative mck I can say that you
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
know the carriers do provide certainly a
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
a wide um and deep array of you know
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
mental health behavioral health um
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
services so and I think that that that
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
that was reflected a little bit in the
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
definition of pain that came up in the
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 66 and I apologize I have to
 
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
run to an 11 o'clock meeting so I'm
 
01:01:38.109 --> 01:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
sorry that's okay I just wanted you to
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
know why I was running off I'm really
 
01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
glad you came thanks may I just ask that
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
in this chart that you provided if you
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
updated could you include Mental Health
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
Services just so we know I mean I I I'm
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
just they're probably covered
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
but yeah that would be
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
a okay yeah
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
but in general were you asking about I
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
mean mental health services there is a
 
01:02:04.029 --> 01:02:04.039 align:start position:0%
vast array that have covered I I
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
guess maybe looking at if there are ones
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
that are included in this current bill
 
01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:12.039 align:start position:0%
that are not currently covered just I we
 
01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
know okay I mean
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
and maybe that's a lot to ask but are
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
are we asking for more in this bill than
 
01:02:22.349 --> 01:02:22.359 align:start position:0%
you already we think that CBT is like
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
really important for managing chronic
 
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
pain so that's a big issue so um
 
01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:34.430 align:start position:0%
pain so that's a big issue so um
representative

01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
Dolan I feel guilty we should all just
 
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
be at a small table I know we could we
 
01:02:41.269 --> 01:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
could reorient the room we probably get
 
01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
in trouble though right I did do that
 
01:02:46.349 --> 01:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
once yeah they can come and sit down oh
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
yeah you're right good
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
thinking thank you Mr chairman um just
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
three quick point my name is uh
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative Tom Dolan
 
01:02:58.990 --> 01:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
I'm actually on the Edna committee so
 
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
some of the questions you have probably
 
01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
you might want to think about bringing
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
in OPC to talk about some of the
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
licensing and so forth um but I had
 
01:03:11.549 --> 01:03:11.559 align:start position:0%
three quick points I wanted to make I'm
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor I'm here representing
 
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
primarily the sponsor representative
 
01:03:20.349 --> 01:03:20.359 align:start position:0%
lungren uh he's a chiro practicing
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
chiropractor and uh in his uh clinical
 
01:03:25.319 --> 01:03:26.510 align:start position:0%
chiropractor and uh in his uh clinical
experience

01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
he sees a lot of people that come to him
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
that are using
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
opioids for their pain management and
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
they come to him with the question is
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
can you help me get off of these opioids
 
01:03:40.269 --> 01:03:40.279 align:start position:0%
I don't want to take them anymore but
 
01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid to stop or I the pain is such
 
01:03:47.269 --> 01:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
that I can't stop so that's that's one
 
01:03:50.029 --> 01:03:50.039 align:start position:0%
of the issues I know representative nle
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
talked about uh the fact you've got this
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
for this summer I would encourage you
 
01:03:57.069 --> 01:03:57.079 align:start position:0%
not to let this go to continue to work
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
it there's there's such a treasure of
 
01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to help New Hampshire
 
01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
Society but that's one the chiropractors
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
are seeing in the in their practices of
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
of how to transition those who are are
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
in pain to something that is maybe
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
massage has a massage solution maybe it
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't but um but the representative
 
01:04:25.269 --> 01:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it really depends on the
 
01:04:29.269 --> 01:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
on the particular case the the second uh
 
01:04:33.789 --> 01:04:33.799 align:start position:0%
issue was referred to me by a classmate
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
of mine who uh is a practicing
 
01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.990 align:start position:0%
of mine who uh is a practicing
anesthesiologist

01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
and uh he's now transitioned uh into
 
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.349 align:start position:0%
and uh he's now transitioned uh into
pain

01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
pain
 
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
management and what he tells me is that
 
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
uh those
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
folks uh after they have a surgery for
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
example they often transition to an
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
opioid solution or opioid like solution
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
and then the next step is to transition
 
01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
off off that medicine and that's and
 
01:05:10.349 --> 01:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
that's the difficult part is to how to
 
01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
get off the medicine and what do you use
 
01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
what what assistance is available to
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
them maybe mental health assistance uh
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
maybe uh medicinal assistance to get off
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
of that medicine and trans transition to
 
01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
to a less medicated world for
 
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
and thirdly I want to mention uh an
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
experience that I've had I'm I'm a six
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
six term town counseler in
 
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
londondary and a lot of experience with
 
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
our first respond responders especially
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the fire
 
01:05:45.269 --> 01:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
department uh dealing with the opioid
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
crisis that we've all been dealing with
 
01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
for the last 20 25 years uh it is such a
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh a crippling force in our our society
 
01:05:58.589 --> 01:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
that it's again something not to let go
 
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
of that that if we got this tiger by the
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
tail let's keep wrestling it to see if
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
we can come up with some good Solutions
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's one issue that that's beyond the
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
scope of what you're talking about today
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm happy to come back at
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
another time I brought this to HHS uh a
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago and and that is U
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
what I'll call uh medicine cabinet
 
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
diving um and that is uh those of us
 
01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
mostly parents who have experienced some
 
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
pain and some pain management and have
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
not finished out their prescription all
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
the doctors say finish a prescription
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
and be done with it they ends up leaving
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
half a dozen pills in the medicon
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
cabinet and then at house party or
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
whatever somebody discovers that and
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
decides to uh take advantage of of that
 
01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
situation and there there is a I propose
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
solution to that believe it or not uh it
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
was not well received by the Chief of
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
Police Association oh so but again I'd
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
be happy to talk to you about that some
 
01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:10.119 align:start position:0%
other time but uh yeah we should I I
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
really appreciate what you just said
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
this has been a 35y year process for me
 
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
trying to find that sweet spot because
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
opioids are important we use them at end
 
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
of life we use them for cir we use them
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
in selected patient with chronic pain
 
01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
and and and they have value for the
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
right person and we've been saying that
 
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
for 35 years and we actually created our
 
01:07:32.829 --> 01:07:32.839 align:start position:0%
first set of opioid prescribing I'm dick
 
01:07:35.549 --> 01:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
I'm being pro whatever we created our
 
01:07:37.269 --> 01:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
first set of opioid prescribing rules we
 
01:07:40.269 --> 01:07:40.279 align:start position:0%
wrote them in 1998 for the state and I
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
still to this day believe that if we had
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
taken those seriously that we could have
 
01:07:46.269 --> 01:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
prevented a lot of the problems that did
 
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
happen because I'll tell you the media
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
took off I have a beautiful headline
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
from us world news and business report
 
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
about how morphine is a cure for
 
01:07:56.349 --> 01:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
everything I mean that that was in the
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
media and I like I love how we like to
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
blame big Pharma for everything but you
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of people to blame
 
01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:03.799 align:start position:0%
but we really tried hard to hit the
 
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
sweet spot and I think that is to me why
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
this I'm I really appreciate what you
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
just said because that's why what we're
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
doing here to me is important um and I
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate what David said about what
 
01:08:16.749 --> 01:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
you said for him that was wonderful I
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to not not to let
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
this go to to keep studying it and and
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
and find some solutions because it we so
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
badly need it in our
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm here if you have any
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
questions but I'm I'm not an expert and
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
I'm not a practitioner or a
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
clinician I'm trying to think do I have
 
01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
questions for you because I do Dr Dr
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative lunger and I have talked
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
a lot about this for several years and I
 
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
really appre sad that he's not here but
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
I think when we meet next time he can be
 
01:08:51.870 --> 01:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
he's on vacation so figures he's got the
 
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
best Tan in the state house for a reason
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering a little bit about the
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
silos of medical care where if you know
 
01:09:00.159 --> 01:09:01.070 align:start position:0%
silos of medical care where if you know
if

01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
the if it costs more for the insurance
 
01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
company to provide expanded services but
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
they're savings somewhere else the
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
insurance company doesn't see it the
 
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
rates go up and so to what degree that's
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
going to be a confounding thing because
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
you know if somebody if you know if
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
towns or ER end up with a lot of people
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
Landing there now presumably if they
 
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
have with overdoses say if presumably if
 
01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
they have insurance that's going to get
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
covered but it's also but it's going to
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
be covered by insurance so if we can
 
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
prevent that that should save the
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
insurance company's money but on the
 
01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
other hand there are a lot of expenses
 
01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
that go with opiate overuse that are not
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
covered by anything other than you know
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
people trying to piece together things
 
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
like Sullivan County has a whole medical
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
assisted treatment plan that's covered
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
not through Insurance because these
 
01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
people don't have it yeah and if we
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
could lower that cost because we just
 
01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
you know have a big increase in county
 
01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
in the county tax rate and some of it's
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
that kind of expense that that maybe
 
01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
reduced and how do you sort of those of
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
us on on the front
 
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
lines the moms and dads in the homes on
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
the front lines what they run into is
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
scary and it's usually in the laundry
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
room as they're emptying the pockets
 
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
before they put the jeans in the in the
 
01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
washing machine with what's this what
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
are what are these pills I just found
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
and and what do I do with them where do
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
I bring them do I flush them down the
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
toilet no that's not good for the
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
environment do I throw them out the car
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
window next time I go to the store
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
no uh so what do I do with them so that
 
01:10:45.149 --> 01:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
that's I'll leave you with that little
 
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
tidbit of of on the on the plus side
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
when I had shoulder surgery two years
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
ago um I got sent home with um an ice
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know an ice pack thing and four
 
01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
oxycodones and um that's I need I took
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
two the first night at the you know the
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
surgeon said you better take these the
 
01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:07.640 align:start position:0%
first night and then after that I never
 
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
needed anything now that's partly luck
 
01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
that I didn't end up having a lot of
 
01:11:14.669 --> 01:11:14.679 align:start position:0%
pain but also partly what's changed when
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
I had neck surgery 10 years ago I got
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
sent home with 60 oxycodon right so I
 
01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of a lot of the
 
01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
practice that's going the right
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
direction but we still have ation that
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's in here is is very important I I
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
like you I had some surgery I had a a
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
hernia surgery and I was being
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
discharged the nurse brought me
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
prescription for 30 oxycodon and I said
 
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
I don't want them I said give me five
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
right and and and we'll keep the other
 
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
25 in the pharmacy I don't I don't want
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
that many because then I got to dispose
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
of them yeah and I didn't want to I'm
 
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
going to give a plug here for Dartmouth
 
01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
right because Dr bar and others um we
 
01:11:58.830 --> 01:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
don't agree much on chronic pain but on
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
acute pain we do but they published a
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
study on on prescribing opioids after
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
routine surgeries and came to the
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
conclusion that everybody's throwing
 
01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
pills out well and that they need to
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
prescribe differently yeah because those
 
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
that are here that have some gray here
 
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
remember the
 
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
fifth yeah Vital sign Vital sign that we
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
used to have to live by in the 90s that
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
pain and so we were forced in large part
 
01:12:27.629 --> 01:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
not by farmer not by anybody else except
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
by our own societies to give away you
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
know opioids a very excessive rate um so
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
we did have the fifth Bal sign it's
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
taking us a while to get over that
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
hangover I remember the number of
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
patients who would say I have a right to
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
right you know yeah yeah if you look at
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
my description you have a right but you
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
also responsibility because people I
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
actually just wanted to tie in
 
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
everything that all you guys are saying
 
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
because I think it's really important
 
01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.229 align:start position:0%
because I think it's really important
legislatively

01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
legislatively
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
um I it's why I wanted to differentiate
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
between what we're talking about in our
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
integrative care committee and what
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here um what you
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
were saying Bill if I can call you bill
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
um is when we when we created that that
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
integrative care committee we we we
 
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
acknowledg that in chronic pain that
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
multimodality therapy is important that
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
it be coordinated and integrative and it
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be done in a coste effective
 
01:13:24.629 --> 01:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
manner that nobody's figured out how to
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
do yet
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
and so that's the whole point of that
 
01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
committee is to figure out strategies to
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
do that using Community existing
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
community services and uh you know and
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's been exciting and there's a lot
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
of people that are really interested in
 
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
that that the difference between that
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
and this bill is we're looking at Uni
 
01:13:45.149 --> 01:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
modality therapies for really more you
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
know some of this is for chronic pain
 
01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
but a lot of it's for acute pain you
 
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
know you know you're not going to go to
 
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
50 different providers hopefully for a
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
sprained ankle but you know you might
 
01:13:56.189 --> 01:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
find that you want access to a
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
chiropractor for an acute back pain or
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
whatever and there's clear evidence to
 
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
support that and so how do we and I
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
think it's really important that we
 
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
differentiate that these are two
 
01:14:07.149 --> 01:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
different bills even though there's a
 
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
lot of overlap and that we do need to
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
give access to integrative care here but
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
also you need modality or B modality
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
care easily cost effectively and do the
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
right thing and I I really you said it
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
three times I think that how important
 
01:14:25.229 --> 01:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here is and I really
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate that because this is a really
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
big deal to me thank you for what you're
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
doing can I ask you a question sure you
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
know in in in reality um I remember when
 
01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
we looked at this bill uh 554 back in
 
01:14:43.149 --> 01:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
23 and I wrote down some comments I made
 
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
here one of them was I agree with the
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
intent but it should not be
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
legislated and there's a lot of us that
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
are in practice that know of the
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
alternatives for uh non opio good
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
management of pain but do we use them
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
regularly no we don't should we perhaps
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh but the question I have and again as
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor of the bill is I wrote down
 
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
should not be legislated what should be
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
legislated I guess that's what we're
 
01:15:15.629 --> 01:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
trying to get at also is what should be
 
01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
legislated and what should not be
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
legislated um and I think those are you
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
don't have to answer that now but if you
 
01:15:24.669 --> 01:15:24.679 align:start position:0%
can send to our chairman you know
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
because I think we're going to have to
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
work on this a little bit longer I I I
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
would relish that opportunity yeah but
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's a great question uh
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
probably a group of of experts like
 
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
yourselves that uh I mean that that are
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
clinician that have clinical experience
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
probably have much better uh group of
 
01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
suggestions than I would have but uh
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
again uh talking with h representative
 
01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
lungren he's just looking for
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
alternative to opio and what what are
 
01:16:01.629 --> 01:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
the Alternatives and uh can what can we
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
do to provide those alternatives to our
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
to our patients so my question to us as
 
01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
well as you and to representative
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
lungren is what should we do
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
legislatively because I'm always
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
hesitant quite honestly to legislate
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
medicine in the care that we provide
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
because I think that we do it well
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
majority of the time but having said
 
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
that we were given that fifth Vital sign
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
20 something years ago and we're still
 
01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
getting over that hangover but I
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree more you know my goal is
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
patient Centric it's access to whatever
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
modality works best it is to basically
 
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
know that it's effective that the
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
provider is good at giving that modality
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
and then to have them not suffer
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
financially from doing that so how we do
 
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
that legislatively I don't really know
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
the answer to that but that's why I
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
would reach out to you and to
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
representative lungren and others to say
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
you know what can we do to streamline
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
this process and I think I can speak for
 
01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:02.679 align:start position:0%
the chiropractors because I met um with
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
both the Chiropractic associations their
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
leadership to talk about this and I I
 
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
think there's two driving forces for
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill one is is the is
 
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
the chiropractors more so than any other
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
alternative provider and then the other
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
is the patients you know as we were
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
talking about before but
 
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
um when I first arrived in New Hampshire
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know people would go to see a
 
01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
chiropractor and go see them two to
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
three times a week forever and insurance
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
is paid for that and now um they're
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
struggling to get any coverage you know
 
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
in a lot of situations and so you know
 
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
they went from famine or Feast to famine
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
and so they want to bring it back to
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
some seat at the table and they're
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
really the ones that are the driving
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
force I'll be honest I haven't had a
 
01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
huge a lot of you know acupuncturists
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know they're very interested in this
 
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
but they're not the driving force
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
um but I think from a legislative
 
01:17:59.149 --> 01:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
standpoint is they feel like they've
 
01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
been left out and they feel that this is
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
the way they need to do things to get
 
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
back left
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
in and and whether we need to do that or
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
not that's another story but that's
 
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
that's their feel I know that's their
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
feeling that's what they vocalized to me
 
01:18:17.229 --> 01:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
and I as a doctor who treats pain I
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
valued what they offer for a very long
 
01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:22.590 align:start position:0%
valued what they offer for a very long
time

01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
so it's it's in in terms of
 
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
management um some whoever becom
 
01:18:33.629 --> 01:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
speaker uh
 
01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
technically decides what committee
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to it should
 
01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
automatically go to help but you never
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
know but there's a FN after the HB on
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
top that means a fiscal note so I looked
 
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
up the fiscal note and they don't have
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
one yeah but that that doesn't mean
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
there won't be
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
one and therefore that means it will go
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
to finance um
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
committee so that uh we want to keep in
 
01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
mind that what committee gets this bill
 
01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
is very
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
significant and what we sometimes think
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
is simple you know that it just should
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
automatically go to help doesn't
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily happen if I could say this
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
is a bill that exists and it's in our
 
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
committee okay yep stay there yes and
 
01:19:32.910 --> 01:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
that's why we're dealing with it do you
 
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
know what what the issue was with the
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note no yes when they first put
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
this up fiscal impact due to time
 
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
constraints lbo the um office of
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistance could not
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
provide a physical not but they didn't
 
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
say that there should be one or should
 
01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
not be they just said because of time
 
01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
constraints and this is back with the
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
original bu right and so my question
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
about that is being is um isn't the
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal note what it's going to cost the
 
01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
state not that the state shouldn't care
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
whether patients or insurance companies
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
pay more but shouldn't it I mean if it's
 
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
if it's not going to cost the Health
 
01:20:14.189 --> 01:20:14.199 align:start position:0%
Human Services or whatever other part of
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
the state more then it shouldn't have a
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
this is what not confuses me because in
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
one of my other bills there was a fiscal
 
01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
note there was like zero cost to the
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
state yeah yeah and then they put an
 
01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on and then they were trying
 
01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
to estimate the cost to other entities
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
that weren't right and and I mean I I
 
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to have it understand cost a
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
lot more either because I same county
 
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
budget the um health insurance cost is
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
up 16% so we don't want to keep don't
 
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
want to keep pushing cost there too and
 
01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:47.719 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm really interested in
 
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
whether aside from better patient care
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
if we can that that doing this right
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
might lead to actual lower costs just so
 
01:20:59.709 --> 01:20:59.719 align:start position:0%
you know I've done 64,000 epidurals in
 
01:20:59.719 --> 01:21:00.550 align:start position:0%
you know I've done 64,000 epidurals in
my

01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
career if I never do another one I'm
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
fine and would I ever let anybody do it
 
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
to me probably not so I mean and that's
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
an expensive intervention and I I just
 
01:21:12.430 --> 01:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
think that's what we're trying to do is
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
save the system money by providing
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
access to stuff that doesn't cost as
 
01:21:17.709 --> 01:21:17.719 align:start position:0%
much and the other thing that's really
 
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
important for pain management is
 
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
self-management and when you time
 
01:21:24.669 --> 01:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
somebody into me to do an injection
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
that's they can't do that on their own
 
01:21:29.709 --> 01:21:29.719 align:start position:0%
at home I don't think so um you know we
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
want to give them as many tools as they
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
can use that are cost effective so they
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
don't need to run to the doctor every
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
time they have a problem they can manage
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
it themselves and that saves everybody
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
money I think we should check I'll be
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
glad to go to the LBA and see if they do
 
01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note because that if if it
 
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
costs outside people right those become
 
01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
opponents of the legisl right yeah right
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
I I can see a certain representative on
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
the finance committee not liking
 
01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
this they might actually like well
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
certain people might actually like it
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
after I saw at the last
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
session um can I just move this to the
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
next step so um we should probably start
 
01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
talking about our summer study um like
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
I'm like I'm just thinking who should be
 
01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
invited um to a discussion and like the
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
four of us are here we don't need more
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
than four I mean it's uh where is mar is
 
01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
he on vacation no he um he's he had a
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
conflict he's a great member he and he
 
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to be here but he couldn't and um
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
chairman McDonald wanted to be here also
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
this was a really big thing for him um
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
but he's out of town so um so there's
 
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
six of us um and then I mean who else
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
should be there and I I mean I um and I
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
can name people off the top of my head
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
but you guys go ahead well it seem to me
 
01:22:58.270 --> 01:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
like the stakeholders should be there
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so the chiropractors somebody that
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
represents chiropractor somebody that
 
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
represent the insurance company somebody
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
that represents the um acupuncturist you
 
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
know what what is their you know you
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
know opinion regarding this bill so I
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
already have um names for all those
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
spots so um and we should let the
 
01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
insurers come back um and um want to
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
meet again what's that when would want
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
to meet again um
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know it's kind of funny because
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
we've actually achieved something here I
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
think so you don't want to put it off
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
too long right well and the other right
 
01:23:35.229 --> 01:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
I was going to say the other thing is
 
01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
said I will completely have forgotten
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
what we talked about today if it goes to
 
01:23:42.189 --> 01:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I have like 47 Pages a minut
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
be um I was thinking like mid July is
 
01:23:49.629 --> 01:23:49.639 align:start position:0%
that too far away no I'm gone until the
 
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
12th to 13th so all right after that
 
01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
after the 13th so I'm sorry you're hurt
 
01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
my so we're talking about pain for me to
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
look at you hurts my neck so that's why
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
I been been looking at you that
 
01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
much um I will grab my book and we this
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
could be this is the other thing
 
01:24:11.550 --> 01:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
um we wanted to be Zoom or do we want it
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
to be in person because if it's an ad
 
01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
hoc meeting we can do what we want I
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
think it's much better in person but it
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
would be it have people have the option
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming yeah thanks that was
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
I'd say in person you know but if people
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
get stuck and they have to do Zoom they
 
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
can do Zoom but it's much having
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
attended meetings by Zoom it's so much
 
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
better in person you don't feel yeah and
 
01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:39.400 align:start position:0%
we we actually have a hybrid thing that
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing for our thing tomorrow at
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
the we're doing it at the hire Hospital
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
Association I don't know if we can use
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
state property for can we use state
 
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
property for a meeting for an ad hoc
 
01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
meeting I can check oh sure yeah so if
 
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
we can like if we can meet here on an ad
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
hoc basis it's just to get it in the
 
01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
calendar all right but if it's ad hoc we
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't need it in the calendar as long as
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
they fix the air condition that is all
 
01:25:07.629 --> 01:25:07.639 align:start position:0%
going to be up to when um our daughter
 
01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
has the baby in which case I might be in
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
New York so then a zoom would be handy
 
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it's an option do you want to
 
01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:17.430 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it's an option do you want to
do

01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
like Wednesday July 7 that doesn't work
 
01:25:23.229 --> 01:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
for you 17th let me open like yeah that
 
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.669 --> 01:25:30.679 align:start position:0%

that's all right with you I really I I
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
don't know what the requirements are for
 
01:26:42.239 --> 01:26:43.390 align:start position:0%
don't know what the requirements are for
posting

01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
posting
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
them I
 
01:26:46.239 --> 01:26:50.590 align:start position:0%
them I
don't

01:26:50.590 --> 01:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and then um um just the Comm
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
system right we could keep forgetting
 
01:27:00.030 --> 01:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
about her she she takes care of all
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
those she's really wonderful so I'll
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
just give her my notes and tell her to
 
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
type it up no that's never happening
 
01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
well this was fun all right so we'll do
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
it then and then um I mean can I just
 
01:27:17.229 --> 01:27:17.239 align:start position:0%
ask like one brief snapshot question
 
01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
like um what and you don't have to
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
answer it if you don't want but just how
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
and if you don't want to answer don't
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
worry about it yeah if you haven't
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
looked at it don't worry about it yeah
 
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
say I I I read through it but it's it's
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot more productive to go
 
01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
back and look at it again now that I
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
feel really guilty about what I did but
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
um when we saw the original Bild the pre
 
01:27:46.639 --> 01:27:48.550 align:start position:0%
um when we saw the original Bild the pre
554

01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
554
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
version um it it just it had a huge
 
01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
number of problems only in that
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
everything that was already in
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
except that they were going to make you
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
write up every time you wrote you had to
 
01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
write up a plan that you had to submit
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
to somebody you know about what you were
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
doing that didn't involve opioids we
 
01:28:08.109 --> 01:28:08.119 align:start position:0%
already have to do that it's St it's
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
isn't statute it's in the medical rules
 
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
so there was nothing in there that we
 
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have to do already um and they
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
didn't really they put in a lot of
 
01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
modalities that we know were not going
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to cover so um we had to get
 
01:28:24.109 --> 01:28:24.119 align:start position:0%
rid of a lot of that then we start
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
strugg when we we discussed the license
 
01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
thing which was not in the original Bill
 
01:28:31.109 --> 01:28:31.119 align:start position:0%
the first section um that was really
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
important to us that it be a licensed
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
provider that evidence-based that was
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
important yeah right oh good thing so
 
01:28:44.109 --> 01:28:44.119 align:start position:0%
yeah because the other thing would be
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
like if
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
it it it can't increase administrative
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
burden because otherwise I mean you
 
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
don't want somebody to go like well I
 
01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
could go through this jump through these
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
hoops or I could write for some oxyon
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
yeah and although there are Hoops for
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
that too but yeah well it was it was
 
01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
crazy I just took one look at it and I
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
just saw nobody's going to want to do
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
pain management if you do this and that
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
that was the barrier because people
 
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
already don't want to do management we
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
want to make it easier and I understand
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
what he was trying to do and what they
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
were trying to do but it just it didn't
 
01:29:21.109 --> 01:29:21.119 align:start position:0%
make it wasn't going to work and that's
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
why we sat down as a group to try to
 
01:29:25.149 --> 01:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
figure out well how can we this has
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
value how do we make it workable for a
 
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
doctor to do is there anything in that
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
build that costs
 
01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
money to to the St I person you know the
 
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
cost of the paper of printing it I I
 
01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
don't I think it's to the system really
 
01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
but with the original bill yeah because
 
01:29:47.629 --> 01:29:47.639 align:start position:0%
um and that that may be why the fiscal
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
notes a challenge is because in the
 
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
original Bill there was a form a doctor
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
would have to fill out that would have
 
01:29:55.109 --> 01:29:55.119 align:start position:0%
to be submitted to to somebody and that
 
01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
somebody would have to keep track of
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
that so that would may be where the
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.109 --> 01:30:20.119 align:start position:0%
from so you can't retire no
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
no well I think it's probably you have
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
to write in all right
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay we'll just have this Mass Lebanon
 
01:30:33.109 --> 01:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
right I didn't I was so happy when you
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
said you were coming because I thought
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
when I knew you weren't running I
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
thought you'd be like a lame duck and
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't because I I was psyched
 
01:30:44.109 --> 01:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
when you said you'd
 
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
come actually I was psyched when you
 
01:30:49.229 --> 01:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
said you'd come too yeah pH was a given
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:54.320 --> 01:31:01.310 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
say is he retired from you
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
too oh because I knew he retired from
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:17.109 --> 01:31:17.119 align:start position:0%
is yeah
 
01:31:21.149 --> 01:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
done can we make a motion to
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
adjourn all in favor I boom here there
 
01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
that was fun that's
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
not I know I was going to bring I have a
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
Stanley hammer in my car truck I was
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
going to bring it in and do that but I
 
01:31:39.709 --> 01:31:39.719 align:start position:0%
didn't want to Dent the
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
table when you get to be a a real
 
01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
really oh yeah yeah yeah I remember you
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
took a picture I don't even remember
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
I remember you making me I I got a kick
 
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
