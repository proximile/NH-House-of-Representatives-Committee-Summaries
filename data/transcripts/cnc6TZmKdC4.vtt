and on the minutes I believe there's a
 
00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:10.850 align:start position:0%
and on the minutes I believe there's a
correction

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:10.860 align:start position:0%

HHS about the immunization registry

rules uh representative Leon had
 
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
requested that the agency amend its
 
00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
religious exemption form by removing the
 
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
phrase requests for a that was to
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
clarify that the religious exemption is
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
a right and does not require a request
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang included that change in his
 
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
conditional approval
 
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.300 align:start position:0%

00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
on to the regular agenda and Department
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
of Education
 
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
and we will cover that item off consent
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
at the same time just to save you the
 
00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:37.670 align:start position:0%
at the same time just to save you the
trouble

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:41.779 align:start position:0%
so for 2022
 
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:45.260 align:start position:0%
1 the comprehensive agricultural
 
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
Educators the reason this is on the
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
regular agenda is because the department
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
or excuse me the board is repealing the
 
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
certification based on the
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the Professional
 
00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:00.899 align:start position:0%
Standards Board
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
the recommendation was based on the low
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
number of Educators that currently work
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
in this field and hold the certification
 
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
upon looking upon the agency's website
 
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
there were only two people listed who
 
00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:14.459 align:start position:0%
had the certification
 
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
so it was placed on the agenda in case
 
00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
the committee had any questions about
 
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
why that certification was being
 
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
repealed and what will happen to those
 
00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:25.019 align:start position:0%
two individuals
 
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
so I would imagine that this um went
 
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:35.459 align:start position:0%
through the regular public meetings and
 
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
so people are aware that we're doing
 
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
that as well as the two people are
 
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.290 align:start position:0%
that as well as the two people are
certified

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
yes the agency is nodding vigorously
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
would you introduce yourself please
 
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
Julie Shea administrative rules
 
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
coordinator for Department of Ed
 
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
Steve Appleby division director
 
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
I presume that the two certified people
 
00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
will continue to be employed because we
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
haven't taken their skills away just a
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
piece of paper
 
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
that is correct okay any other questions
 
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.470 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
um

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:12.740 align:start position:0%
I looked on the
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
certification database
 
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.870 align:start position:0%
certification database
and

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
I found
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
that there were seven people with that
 
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.509 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
there are however many of the
 
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
individuals hold other endorsements
 
00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
and this endorsement is actually
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
redundant to the career and tech ed
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
agriculture endorsement so all of these
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
folks qualify
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
at no cost to them for the comprehensive
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
CTE agriculture endorsement follow-up
 
00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
so when I looked on the certification
 
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
database I found only two people
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
certified with the general agricultural
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
um educator and when I and
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
comprehensive agricultural educator is a
 
00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
different endorsement yeah so
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
essentially we're combining these two
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
endorsements because they're their
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
requirements are identical with one
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
exception that is the degree requirement
 
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
the degree requirement for the non-cte
 
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
which is comprehensive agriculture this
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
rule set that degree requirement is a
 
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree the career in tech ed
 
00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:38.459 align:start position:0%
endorsement does not have that
 
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree requirement but the
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
competencies and expectations are
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
so what you're following yes so
 
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
essentially what you're doing is you're
 
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.150 align:start position:0%
essentially what you're doing is you're
repealing

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
repealing
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
um the general agricultural endorsement
 
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
we're repealing the comprehensive
 
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
agriculture endorsement
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
I I think that there's um some sort of
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
confusion here because there are seven
 
00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
people with that endorsement that are
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
employed and only one of them one of
 
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:18.500 align:start position:0%
those seven
 
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.410 align:start position:0%
those seven
has

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:20.420 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
another endorsement that's related to
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and that would be animal
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
s science or some kind of animals things
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
so I think that
 
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.490 align:start position:0%
so I think that
there's

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
a confusion here
 
00:14:39.889 --> 00:14:39.899 align:start position:0%
so the the State Board is repealing the
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
comprehensive agriculture endorsement
 
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
whether it's two people hold it or seven
 
00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
really doesn't ultimately matter
 
00:14:49.009 --> 00:14:49.019 align:start position:0%
everyone who holds it has been notified
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
via email and we have in contact with
 
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
them and they will automatically be
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
eligible for the career and tech ed
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
agriculture endorsement
 
00:14:59.689 --> 00:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
by nature of holding currently comp
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
agriculture so we're essentially again
 
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
collapsing two separate endorsements
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
with the same requirements into one so
 
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
what are those two endorsements one is
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
comprehensive agriculture educator and
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
or teacher and the other one is the CTE
 
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.290 align:start position:0%
or teacher and the other one is the CTE
agriculture

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.569 --> 00:15:20.579 align:start position:0%
and then under that CT agriculture there
 
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:23.660 align:start position:0%
are some sub endorsements like animal
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so so this has been
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
approved by the Board of Ed of Education
 
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
it's had the proper comment and none of
 
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
the and
 
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:40.220 align:start position:0%
were essentially transitioning
 
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:43.100 align:start position:0%
agricultural teaching from the general
 
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
education pool into the CTE pool is that
 
00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:49.019 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
not sure I agree with that people ought
 
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
to know about agriculture everywhere but
 
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
that's not my decision to make
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments
 
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn yeah so I I guess I
 
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that I'm understanding
 
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
you say that the the the the one
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
the position that these people the two
 
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
people will be transitioned into
 
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
does not require a bachelor's degree is
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
correct so we have two endorsements
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
today both agriculture right one
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
requires a bachelor's degree which that
 
00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:23.990 align:start position:0%
requires a bachelor's degree which that
person

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
um there were only several of them
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
Statewide and that teach in a non-cte
 
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
center under that endorsement those
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
folks this does not affect their ability
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
to do the job as the chair pointed out
 
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
this is just right what license they
 
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
hold and so those folks can then
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
they qualify automatically for the CTE
 
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
agriculture endorsement if they want to
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
maintain licensure and that would allow
 
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:51.959 align:start position:0%
them to continue
 
00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339 align:start position:0%
right I guess the only thing I'm
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
concerned I'm concerned about is is the
 
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
effect of this that we're sort of
 
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
lowering the standards that are required
 
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.790 align:start position:0%
lowering the standards that are required
for

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.569 align:start position:0%
for
um

00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:02.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
people that teach in this area in other
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
words now
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
at least for some of some of what
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
of of the people that previously were
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
required to have bachelor's degrees now
 
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
they don't and I'm just wondering if
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
that in effect is a lowering of the
 
00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:22.730 align:start position:0%
that in effect is a lowering of the
standards

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
I don't I won't speak for the state
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
board but that wasn't their feeling
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
we have a situation right now in one of
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
our districts where CT centers across
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
the parking lot from a high school
 
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.390 align:start position:0%
the parking lot from a high school
and

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
they teach the same agriculture class
 
00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539 align:start position:0%
across the parking lot from each other
 
00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:42.299 align:start position:0%
but one has our higher requirement for
 
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
licensure than the other but it's the
 
00:17:45.169 --> 00:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
same class
 
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
so the State Board felt that that didn't
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sense
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
I presume that all all teachers regard
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
regardless of their certification do
 
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
have a bachelor's degree in something
 
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:02.220 align:start position:0%
I'm not in our CTE centers ah
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
they may have Hands-On experiences dad
 
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
representative Broda
 
00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:09.539 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to Echo um
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn's concern in that
 
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
because there are two high schools with
 
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
similar programs that high school is not
 
00:18:21.049 --> 00:18:21.059 align:start position:0%
going to issue a bachelor's right it's
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
just going to issue a high school
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
diploma so you're talking about two
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
similar tracks
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
so I can understand how the CTE program
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
comes into play but I don't understand
 
00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
repealing a bachelor's program it's not
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
a bachelor's purpose did you say yeah
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
the teacher must have a bachelor's
 
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
presumably in agriculture I'm sorry when
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
you say ba it confused me okay thank you
 
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
I apologize so would it be fair to
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
assume that the high schools that
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
currently have agricultural programs
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
May eliminate them in favor of sending
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
people to the CTE or do or are they able
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
to continue teaching them with teachers
 
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
without a specific agricultural
 
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
certification yes in fact this should
 
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
actually allow more high schools to add
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
agriculture programs
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
because they will the requirements for
 
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
agriculture teacher were much higher
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
than the CTE requirements right so that
 
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
held back some high schools it's our
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
understanding from offering agricultural
 
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
programs because they couldn't get a
 
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
licensed teacher in this area
 
00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:30.500 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:36.419 align:start position:0%
so can can you look up
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
the um two endorsements that you're
 
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
talking about because you're I just
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
um think that it's not clear which one
 
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:52.220 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't know by looking at
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know what is the other one thank
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
you madam chair so again on on the
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
packet that was given us on 20 on 22 221
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
right onto 6A it says the board of
 
00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:09.020 align:start position:0%
education is proposing the repeal of Ed
 
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
507.04 on the certification of
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
comprehensive agriculture
 
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
um educator so I I think it's clear what
 
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
they're eliminating I think the idea
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
that if I understand the agency correct
 
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
is that all they're doing is folding
 
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
this comprehensive certification into
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
the CTE certification so that either in
 
00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
high school or a CTE Center a teacher
 
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
that holds a CTE certification can teach
 
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
in both environments
 
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
okay representative Lynch so I guess I'm
 
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm still not clear on this this
 
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:42.539 align:start position:0%
aspect of it in other words why
 
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
and and please understand I I certainly
 
00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
don't suggest that you that you you know
 
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
that that there shouldn't be some
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
grandfather provision for people who are
 
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
currently teaching and don't have a
 
00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
degree but I I guess I'm not I mean why
 
00:20:59.150 --> 00:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
is it that you've decided to that the
 
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
way to handle this is to eliminate the
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
bachelor's uh requirement for these two
 
00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:06.299 align:start position:0%
teachers as opposed to saying we're
 
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
going to require a bachelor's degree for
 
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
everybody that teaches in this area and
 
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
we will we will grandfather the people
 
00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
that don't have it for now but going
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
forward I mean it does sort of seem that
 
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
that you really are lowering the
 
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
standards you're saying that the
 
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree is not important for
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
this teaching so
 
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
um just for a little background on the
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
process of how these rules land here uh
 
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
the first thing that occurs is the
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
Professional Standards Board forms a
 
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
committee typically several years prior
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
to expiration of any Rule and the
 
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
Professional Standards Board is made up
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
of Educators from our public system
 
00:21:42.049 --> 00:21:42.059 align:start position:0%
superintendents teachers other
 
00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:45.419 align:start position:0%
practitioners and they conducted their
 
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
subcommittee conducted a study
 
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:49.580 align:start position:0%
um they looked at what other states do
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
they surveyed folks from the field and
 
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
then they combined all that into a
 
00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the state board and
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
their recommendation was the repeal of
 
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
this endorsement and just going with the
 
00:22:03.169 --> 00:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
CTE endorsement
 
00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
the State Board then held their normal
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
course of meetings had public hearing I
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
don't believe we received any comment
 
00:22:12.649 --> 00:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
regarding the repeal at the State Board
 
00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
and at that point the State Board
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
unanimously passed as the PSP had done
 
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
repealing this and just using the CTE
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
endorsement moving forward so
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
um And to clarify the numbers the CTE
 
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
General agriculture endorsement there
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
are two individuals the comprehensive
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
agriculture there are seven individuals
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
those seven will get the CTE agriculture
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
endorsement moving forward they will not
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
need to have it to teach in a non-cte
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
high school because this will become a
 
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
non-credentialed role in those high
 
00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.070 align:start position:0%
non-credentialed role in those high
schools

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
the local superintendent can still
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
require the individual to hold a
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree in order to hire them
 
00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:57.179 align:start position:0%
it just means that to get the CTE
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
agriculture endorsement
 
00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
they will no longer have that degree
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
requirement but but there is quite a
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
process to this over several years and a
 
00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
lot of it comes from the field itself
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
so we did hear superintendents that feel
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
that there is a barrier to them offering
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
agriculture classes because many folks
 
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
from that field
 
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
similar to what whether it's an auto
 
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
mechanic or a welder don't tend to have
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degrees
 
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Senator Lang so
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
again I just as well we're just proving
 
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
the rule here just as a statement of
 
00:23:33.529 --> 00:23:33.539 align:start position:0%
comment is that many businesses
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
including the state of New Hampshire
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
state of Maryland are removing Bachelor
 
00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:39.059 align:start position:0%
degrees from job specific positions
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
things like I.T and things like
 
00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:42.539 align:start position:0%
agriculture things where we have degrees
 
00:23:44.649 --> 00:23:44.659 align:start position:0%
were required they're now substituting
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
experience on a regular basis in the
 
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
workforce that we're in and so I don't
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
think this is an uncommon move in in in
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
Industry right now those in teachers is
 
00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
why we have CTE programs again CD
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
programs use people are experts in their
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
field but may not necessarily have a
 
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
degree and they're just as capable of
 
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
teaching the expert topic that they're
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
talking about so I I don't see a problem
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
with doing this I think it's a good move
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
for us especially in the labor market
 
00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:19.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
one more comment
 
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
that that explanation makes sense but
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
when I hear that there are only two
 
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
people in the program from you from your
 
00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:36.500 align:start position:0%
testimony I know that the two the
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
certification that has two employees is
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
called General Agriculture and not
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
comprehensive agriculture which has
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
seven people certified and when I looked
 
00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:50.570 align:start position:0%
seven people certified and when I looked
up

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
people working
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
in a school district with with an
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
either General agricultural con
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive agricultural animal
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
science or Horticulture I came up with
 
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
23 people and this is impacting seven of
 
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
23 which is significant and I just the
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
fact that you tell tell me that there's
 
00:25:15.409 --> 00:25:15.419 align:start position:0%
only two people in this program and it's
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
just concerning can I just clarify for
 
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
the record that the number two first
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
came from OLS not from my testimony
 
00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you we're we appreciate your
 
00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
saying that you know how many people are
 
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
in which category of certification chair
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
move to a proof is there a second okay
 
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
okay thank you second by by Senator
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
Ennis and any further discussion
 
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
hey thank you let's go on to the uh
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
what is it the comprehensive business
 
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
educator which was taken off consent are
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
there any uh
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
comments on that
 
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
um no I had no comments on this it was
 
00:26:04.269 --> 00:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
consent um they are essentially
 
00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
repealing a section and then re-adopting
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
it with amendments
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see a bunch at the top text
 
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
that's been crossed out and then
 
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
Rewritten below it
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
so what's the use the essence of the
 
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.350 align:start position:0%
so what's the use the essence of the
change

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
um it looks like they're renumbering
 
00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:28.010 align:start position:0%
um it looks like they're renumbering
um

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
secretly outlined
 
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
the re-aducted okay the relevant
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
requirements have been absorbed as
 
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
amendments in the newly amended 507 49
 
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
making 507.48 no longer necessary
 
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that seems pretty clear
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
um I'd like if you could give us a
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
better explanation of this so I looked
 
00:26:58.679 --> 00:26:59.930 align:start position:0%
better explanation of this so I looked
at

00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
um certificate people excuse me
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative fellows if since you've
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
asked them for an explanation perhaps
 
00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
they could take it from there
 
00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
okay we'll start with that okay
 
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.010 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
um so we had a marketing endorsement and
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
a business endorsement and what the
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
state board is doing is combining them
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
into one endorsement
 
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
so taking the competencies of marketing
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
which was held by very few folks
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
and folding those into the
 
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
requirements for business and moving
 
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
forward with one endorsement instead of
 
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
two separate ones so the essence is that
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
all people teaching
 
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
have some competencies in marketing so
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
the comprehensive business educator
 
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
already had some elements of marketing
 
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
in it and what the PSB did is they took
 
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
the comprehensive marketing educator
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
took some of those other pieces that
 
00:27:59.090 --> 00:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
weren't included in the business
 
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
educator originally and then they moved
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
those under the business educator so
 
00:28:06.409 --> 00:28:06.419 align:start position:0%
that the marketing piece was a little
 
00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
bit more robust and now all of those
 
00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:12.779 align:start position:0%
folks that hold the comprehensive
 
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
business have a little bit more of a
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
marketing requirement just because they
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
have all of those different elements
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
involved versus just the very specific
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
marketing educator
 
00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:27.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
um just speaking as a marketing
 
00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
professor at UNH
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm pretty comfortable with this
 
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
change thank you
 
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
and I would have to say that with my
 
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
experience with small businesses in
 
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
particular having everybody learn
 
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
something about marketing is very
 
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.029 align:start position:0%
something about marketing is very
important

00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.549 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
um

00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:55.460 align:start position:0%
don't I one of the reasons I thought
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
would it made sense to have a separate
 
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
marketing is that that's a very
 
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.909 align:start position:0%
marketing is that that's a very
um

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.919 --> 00:29:06.370 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:06.380 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
subscribed major for college students so
 
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
I wonder if this has any impact on the
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment program or I don't know
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
if you still call it
 
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.630 align:start position:0%
if you still call it
um

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
what is it like there's another burning
 
00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
star another program that used to have
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
where they could get um credit for the
 
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
running Start program
 
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
I am not aware of any impact but I'm
 
00:29:36.289 --> 00:29:36.299 align:start position:0%
also not I'm I can't answer either way
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
okay questions move to approve
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
second okay
 
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none those in favor I
 
00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:52.070 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none those in favor I
opposed

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
professional education requirements
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman yes was the second on
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
that representative Schmidt yes thank
 
00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.430 align:start position:0%
that representative Schmidt yes thank
you

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
okay for item 2023-10
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
um this is on the
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
professional education requirements for
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
each graduate of a professional educator
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
preparation program the reason this is
 
00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
on the regular agenda is because these
 
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
rules had expired on December 17th of
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
2021 so these rules are now currently
 
00:30:30.889 --> 00:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:33.299 align:start position:0%
for shame
 
00:30:35.289 --> 00:30:35.299 align:start position:0%
what you have to say about that please
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
so this rule set points to our
 
00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
corresponding set of rules in the Ed
 
00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.250 align:start position:0%
corresponding set of rules in the Ed
500s

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
500s
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
so there
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
many of our ed600 rules we're going to
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
be back before you month after month in
 
00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:51.059 align:start position:0%
the future because we're going to
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
instead of having all this voluminous
 
00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:57.299 align:start position:0%
text in the ed600s that is identical to
 
00:30:59.570 --> 00:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
the ed500s we're merely going to change
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
wording to point to the corresponding
 
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
500. so the 500s were in place never
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
expired and those are requirement of
 
00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.510 align:start position:0%
expired and those are requirement of
licensure

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
so having this expire had no net effect
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
on our licensure operation because the
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
that's not a good reason why it expired
 
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying that's
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
it any other questions or comments
 
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
move to approve
 
00:31:30.409 --> 00:31:30.419 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:34.130 align:start position:0%
those in favor
aye

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
those opposed
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
hey thank you very much and I think
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%

right
um

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%

00:31:48.889 --> 00:31:48.899 align:start position:0%

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you so much for
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
hearing my comments my name is Stephanie
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
Patrick I'm from disability rights
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
Center and I wanted to talk to you about
 
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
the Hem 310s we did send a letter to the
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
committee earlier this week expressing
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
our concerns
 
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
um so hopefully you receive that it is
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
much more eloquently describes these
 
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
issues than I will today I'm sure but
 
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
I'm hopefully you have that I did bring
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
some copies so if you didn't see it let
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
me know I'm happy to to pass some of
 
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
those around I'm not sure if I have
 
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
enough for everyone yeah I did not
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
actually receive that
 
00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:51.299 align:start position:0%
um so I would like a coffee if oh you
 
00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:52.580 align:start position:0%
didn't okay
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
send it on Wednesday my email I'm sorry
 
00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
our office has been having internet
 
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:33:18.889 --> 00:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
so rather than reading your letter if
 
00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:21.059 align:start position:0%
you could summarize the important
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
comments and concerns
 
00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to do that
 
00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:27.059 align:start position:0%
so um disability rights Center the goal
 
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
of our agency is to protect the rights
 
00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:30.059 align:start position:0%
of people with disabilities across New
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we have been having
 
00:33:33.889 --> 00:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
conversations with the Department of
 
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services over the past
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
I would say a year almost about this
 
00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:39.710 align:start position:0%
I would say a year almost about this
rule

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
um and so we we've made some progress
 
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
but we do have significant concerns
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
still with the proposed Rule and whether
 
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
it complies with federal law
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
whether it what whether it complies with
 
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
so the federal law in the center for
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid services makes it
 
00:33:59.330 --> 00:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
clear and this is all about tenant
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
protections for people who live in group
 
00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:03.059 align:start position:0%
homes let's give you the context of this
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's the ATM 310s protect the rights of
 
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
and um they provide an overview of the
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
rights the the major proposed change
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
that we are concerned about are the the
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
rights of tenants
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
so back in 2014 the federal government
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
passed a law and rules called the HCBS
 
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
settings rule and what it says is that
 
00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:26.930 align:start position:0%
settings rule and what it says is that
if

00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
people who live in group homes don't
 
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
have the same rights as tenants who live
 
00:34:33.169 --> 00:34:33.179 align:start position:0%
in apartments in New Hampshire the state
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
is required to provide comparable rights
 
00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
so it says for settings in which
 
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant laws do not apply which
 
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:41.339 align:start position:0%
we believe they don't apply in these
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
settings based on New Hampshire's law
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
because there are exceptions for people
 
00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
in group homes
 
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
um the state must ensure that a lease
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
residency agreement or other form of
 
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
written agreement will be in place for
 
00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
each HCBS participant and that the
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
document provides protections that
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
address eviction processes and appeals
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
comparable to those provided under the
 
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:05.099 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions landlord tenant laws
 
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
and so um the letter just explains what
 
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
our concerns are
 
00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
the first one is that you have to have a
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
notice when you whenever you're given a
 
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
notice to be evicted that you're going
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
to be evicted and it has to be very
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
clear that it is not in order to vacate
 
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:23.579 align:start position:0%
that you if you appeal the evictions
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
procedure you all know this I'm sure
 
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
much better than I do in terms of
 
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
evictions if you appeal that eviction
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
you are allowed to stay in that place
 
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
while the eviction is going through the
 
00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.410 align:start position:0%
while the eviction is going through the
process

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
and so the notice needs to be very clear
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
on that the second is that the the rules
 
00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
around that are proposed around actually
 
00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
appealing that of fiction do not make it
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
clear that the person is allowed to stay
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
during that process and we feel like
 
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
this is critical because it's also not
 
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:49.849 align:start position:0%
this is critical because it's also not
clear

00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
otherwise how someone would be able to
 
00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
dispute whether they meet the criteria
 
00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:56.579 align:start position:0%
specifically if the landlord alleges
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
that their behavior would adversely
 
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
affect the health or safety of other
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
tenants or that the tenant has called
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
has called substantial damage to the
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
premises and I will say that in in our
 
00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:08.099 align:start position:0%
work representing people with
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
disabilities we often have to hear
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
disputes about that a provider who
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps says that one one threatening
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
statement from a person with a
 
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
disability which is related to their
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
disability these are behaviors that
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
they're working on
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
um would would cause that level of
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
threat and so we feel like it's critical
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
that a person with a disability would
 
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
actually be able to stay during the
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
eviction process and be able to go in
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
front of a judge and say I don't believe
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
that my behavior met the standard for
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
evictions within the 72-hour notice
 
00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:40.619 align:start position:0%
um it's critical that the person is able
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
to engage in the discovery process to be
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
able to provide their evidence that they
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
are addressing these behaviors and that
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
they are um that they have an impartial
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
person who can hear that because
 
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's just up to I guess the
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
provider the area agency it's not
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
exactly clear within the role so like I
 
00:36:59.450 --> 00:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
said I sent you a very much more
 
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:01.140 align:start position:0%
eloquent letter that explained those
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
concerns hopefully you have none now but
 
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
we we do not believe that the the
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
proposed rule provides sufficient
 
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
protections for people with disabilities
 
00:37:11.569 --> 00:37:11.579 align:start position:0%
who um who have been alleged to be
 
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
engaged in these behaviors and um are
 
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
appealing that that decision by the
 
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.589 align:start position:0%
appealing that that decision by the
provider

00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
provider
 
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that appears to
 
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
demonstrate your concerns does the
 
00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:31.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.089 --> 00:37:35.099 align:start position:0%
well we first do we have any questions
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
no I think you made your point where
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
very clearly and we'd like to hear from
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
the agency on why they uh what they're
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Melissa Nemeth I
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
am the attorney for the Bureau of
 
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
Developmental services
 
00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:05.099 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Allison radmay
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
administrator for the administrative
 
00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
rules unit for the Department of Health
 
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
so uh as as Stephanie pointed out this
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
is a The Residency agreement is newly
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
something that we're adding to the rule
 
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
in order to comply with Federal
 
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.270 align:start position:0%
in order to comply with Federal
Regulations

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
Regulations
 
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
um and it does say that individuals need
 
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
to have rights comparable to individuals
 
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
what they would have under the landlord
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
tenant law the Department's position is
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
that the what we have in the rule and
 
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
The Residency agreement that is attached
 
00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
meets the requirements of the of giving
 
00:38:46.609 --> 00:38:46.619 align:start position:0%
notice I'm looking at on the on the
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
final proposal it's page 20.
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
um letter C provides information about
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
if the provider is choosing to end the
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
residency agreement in in number one
 
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
these the standard if there's not a
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
behavior that is alleged to be an
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
immediate safety concern is that the
 
00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
notification will be provided 90 days
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
before the proposed termination date and
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
they highlight the word proposed as I
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
think that gets to the question about
 
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
that is not a you're not moving out on
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
that day that's we're proposing to end
 
00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
sort of like an eviction when you get a
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
notice we're proposing to end your
 
00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
tenancy on X date so we have that
 
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
provided in in number one okay
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to the committee
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
that representative Hawkin Phillips yes
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so as an attorney
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
who used to practice landlord tenant law
 
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire I can
 
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
assure um the department as well as the
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
committee here that there are notice
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
requirements in eviction
 
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
um proceedings the actual service that
 
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
requires that special notification that
 
00:39:59.329 --> 00:39:59.339 align:start position:0%
this you know there's a there's a
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
Verbatim verbiage that you have to
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
include on the original notices that
 
00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
talk about this is not your day of
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
leaving this is your ability to appeal
 
00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
the process and to apply with the court
 
00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
to defeat this eviction so I mean there
 
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
there are specific protections under RSA
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
540 and throughout that long landlord
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
chapter that assures that verbiage is
 
00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
already included on any eviction notice
 
00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.130 align:start position:0%
already included on any eviction notice
so

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
um I think that the concern is important
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the woman who gave
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier but I think that our
 
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:34.740 align:start position:0%
rsas already do have those protections
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
built in except if that RSA does not
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily apply to someone living in a
 
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
group home
 
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.349 align:start position:0%
group home
no

00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that is correct I think
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
the RSA for any evictions
 
00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
do fall under RSA 540. um that's our
 
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the landlord
 
00:40:56.569 --> 00:40:56.579 align:start position:0%
tenant law exempts these um in RSA 540
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
it says facilities that are licensed
 
00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
under RSA 151 are certified under RSA
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
126a and those are the types of
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
locations that we're talking about so
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's why we're building that into the
 
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
rule but getting back to our in the rule
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
here in number six is language about if
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
the resident fails to vacate the
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
residents by the termination date then
 
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
the provider gives that notice and get
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
that would give them the ability to
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
appeal so they get the original notice
 
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
it would be 90 days in the ordinary
 
00:41:31.849 --> 00:41:31.859 align:start position:0%
course or if there were significant
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
concerns about someone's Behavior
 
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
causing safety concerns to themselves or
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
others it would be a 72-hour notice but
 
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
in either case if the individual does
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
not vacate the premises by that proposed
 
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
termination date then they get a notice
 
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:49.140 align:start position:0%
um to vacate within three days and then
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
that's what they are able to appeal and
 
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
um because the landlord tenant laws
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
don't apply and this these are overseen
 
00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
by the the department it would be to the
 
00:41:59.450 --> 00:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
Department's administrative Appeals Unit
 
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
that these hearings
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
um where that would fall so we feel like
 
00:42:05.569 --> 00:42:05.579 align:start position:0%
the information included here and the
 
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
requirements for the notice are
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
sufficient to meet the needs and give
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate notice to folks and they
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
would to the concern about you know
 
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
there was a something raised about the
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
discovery process and information they
 
00:42:19.849 --> 00:42:19.859 align:start position:0%
would be allowed to provide the there is
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
another set of rules
 
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
um HEC 200 that govern the
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
administrative appeals process and in
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
that process IT addresses the exchange
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
of Discovery materials so the department
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
didn't feel it was
 
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
needed to include that here in this rule
 
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
because this is just your your rights
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
and if it falls into that appeal process
 
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
then those rules would be invoked and
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
that process would be followed
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
follower just a quick follow-up could
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.089 --> 00:42:56.099 align:start position:0%
so that where I was looking was RSA 540
 
00:42:58.849 --> 00:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
colon one in definitions of actions
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
against tenants sure
 
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
um and it gives it gives the exemptions
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
under Roman numeral four and it's letter
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
C great there thank you you're welcome
 
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.650 align:start position:0%
C great there thank you you're welcome
representative

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
so I think the woman who spoke before
 
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:15.380 align:start position:0%
you her concern was that these
 
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
conditions would not have would not or
 
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
might not be properly identified to
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
those individuals living in these
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
facilities so how do these what you
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.079 --> 00:43:31.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:43:31.849 --> 00:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
prove otherwise
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.829 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
there they would be able to appeal that
 
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
if they if they were they got a 72-hour
 
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
notice to leave and we gave the
 
00:43:47.329 --> 00:43:47.339 align:start position:0%
expedited time frame which is attracts
 
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
to landlord tenant live someone's
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
behavior is dangerous then but again if
 
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
they don't move out then they get the
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
right to appeal and that's when they
 
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
could raise the through that appeals
 
00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
process is where they could challenge
 
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
that they didn't feel that that reason
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
for them being provided that notice was
 
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
appropriate would it be reasonable to
 
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
ask you to include the explicit language
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
for that on any written notice that they
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
receive because I can imagine that
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
someone who receives such a notice
 
00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
might not be interested in Wading
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
through layers of laws and rules to find
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
their uh their rights
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
so they're going to have attached to the
 
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:28.140 align:start position:0%
rule is the residency agreement that
 
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
they they sign when they move in here
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
and there is a section in there that
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
points to that includes all of these
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
Provisions that I've talked about in the
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
rule they're Incorporated in this form
 
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
okay but but what I I'm specifically
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
asking if you're handing somebody a
 
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
notice that you have to find a new place
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
to live in 90 days you should explicitly
 
00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
give them what they can do about it
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
if they don't agree with the decision
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
especially the the appeal aspect I think
 
00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%
otherwise you're you're I mean I agree
 
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
with the chair entirely it may be
 
00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
explicitly stated earlier in that
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
document but I I think if you're going
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
to be giving them that notice and you
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
have to inform them as well that they
 
00:45:14.809 --> 00:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
have the right to appeal right there so
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
they don't have to dig around through
 
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
their contract to find it exactly
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
because I was particularly somebody
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
who's been there for a while probably
 
00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:27.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
foreign so this one again on on what
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
page around page 20 of the rule on under
 
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
number six it specifically says I mean
 
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
besides first they give them 90 days to
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
notice and then it looks like if they
 
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:41.339 align:start position:0%
don't move out
 
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
um there they give that 72-hour notice
 
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
and included as requirement included on
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
that notice that 72-hour notice that
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
they must leave it says it includes the
 
00:45:52.609 --> 00:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
rights of the residents to an appeal and
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
the notice in accordance with the appeal
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
process that's listed below and then the
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
appeal process has all the other
 
00:45:59.809 --> 00:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
conditions so I think we're giving
 
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:02.220 align:start position:0%
notice across the board you know even at
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
the last minute when the person still
 
00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
hasn't moved out we're saying oh by the
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
way you have to get out and here's your
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
appeal process if you disagree with us
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
and they're telling them that in the
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
notice requirement at least according to
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
the rule
 
00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.950 align:start position:0%
the rule
yes

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
reps on Broda so my concern is that
 
00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:20.339 align:start position:0%
these are individuals that have special
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
needs they're there for a special reason
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
and they get this eviction notice right
 
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
what if I mean if I were I would imagine
 
00:46:30.109 --> 00:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
that I would be very uncomfortable with
 
00:46:30.119 --> 00:46:30.770 align:start position:0%
that I would be very uncomfortable with
that

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
and then you know do I stick it under my
 
00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:35.579 align:start position:0%
bed do I you know hide it do I pretend
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
it didn't happen I mean what record it
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
says that you can call and it says you
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
can have a
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
a right to a team meeting and maybe that
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
is the protocol but I just feel as if
 
00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
three days you know within 90 day with a
 
00:46:53.819 --> 00:46:54.770 align:start position:0%
three days you know within 90 day with a
three-day

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
three-day
 
00:46:56.809 --> 00:46:56.819 align:start position:0%
um eviction notice then to get the
 
00:46:59.569 --> 00:46:59.579 align:start position:0%
appeal notice seems to me a little bit
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
too late so I think that we should
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
outline those things off at the very
 
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
beginning so that these individuals who
 
00:47:08.089 --> 00:47:08.099 align:start position:0%
are challenged in ways that we do not
 
00:47:08.099 --> 00:47:09.230 align:start position:0%
are challenged in ways that we do not
know

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.609 align:start position:0%
know
are

00:47:10.609 --> 00:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
given that help yes and since you
 
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
already have that information of what
 
00:47:19.609 --> 00:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
what the appeals process is
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
just attack make sure reference it in C1
 
00:47:26.569 --> 00:47:26.579 align:start position:0%
you know provide the notice in writing
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
you know and make sure that said notice
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
includes the
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
the appeal process and the rights of the
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
tenant it's Madam chair are we talking
 
00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
number one on the 90-day notice just
 
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
including the appeal process in that
 
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
90-day notice I mean understand the
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
90-day notice is the resident the legal
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
guardian and the service coordinator so
 
00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
there are people just other than the
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
resident getting this notice there his
 
00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
case Handler and everybody else is
 
00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
getting getting that notice to be able
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
to act on it on the resident's behalf so
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
I I guess you know it doesn't seem
 
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to say to take that that
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
last line in number six that says then
 
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
include the rights of the resident to
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
appeal and add that to the 90-day notice
 
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
so that they know in advance as an
 
00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
appeal process
 
00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
and they're not waiting to just three
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
days before to find out there's an
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
appeal process
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
does that sound like a reasonable
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
compromise yes okay representative if I
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
could if I could follow up I think also
 
00:48:26.329 --> 00:48:26.339 align:start position:0%
would that also be required would you be
 
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
looking for that in number four as well
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
number four is where a 72-hour notice is
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
given if they're
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
um behavior is dangerous so you're
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
saying in both of those places that's a
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
good idea representative Leo um thank
 
00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
you madam chair my question is a little
 
00:48:43.609 --> 00:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
more process related it sounds like
 
00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
there's going to be significant changes
 
00:48:47.089 --> 00:48:47.099 align:start position:0%
to this are we going to have a chance to
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
review that again before our final
 
00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
approval because I would like to be able
 
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
to to compare what happens with the
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
general community and in those with
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
that are under the Bureau of
 
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
Developmental Services actually unless
 
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
there are some other issues
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
this one we've got some fairly specific
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
language we want to include in two known
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
places so that would be a conditional
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
approval if we were to approve and
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
that'll come back to us actually it
 
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
um I guess my question is I would like
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to go a little deeper just to
 
00:49:23.569 --> 00:49:23.579 align:start position:0%
make sure there's nothing else we're
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
missing that's provided to your average
 
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
person that's not provided here I'm just
 
00:49:29.089 --> 00:49:29.099 align:start position:0%
not sure what that would do to our
 
00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:31.010 align:start position:0%
not sure what that would do to our
process

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:34.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
which timeline for us we our deadline is
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
May 20 23rd when's the next meeting
 
00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
it would be before that okay
 
00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
all right we will are there any other
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns specific
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.630 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
um

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:05.690 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
all right so we will ask you to include
 
00:50:10.609 --> 00:50:10.619 align:start position:0%
those items in a
 
00:50:10.619 --> 00:50:11.930 align:start position:0%
those items in a
um

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
for prior to conditional approval and we
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
will take it up at our next meeting to
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
give the committee a chance to to finish
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
reading this rule so are you postponing
 
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
this to the next meeting yes okay the
 
00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:26.930 align:start position:0%
this to the next meeting yes okay the
decision

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
you need a motion of that can we just do
 
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.109 align:start position:0%
you need a motion of that can we just do
it

00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
um do we need a motion to postpone
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful I move the postpone
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
uh 12 seconds
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
by Leon and hack and Phillips uh any
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
aye aye opposed all right we will see
 
00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:49.940 align:start position:0%
this one again
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
who has that one uh 241
 
00:51:15.049 --> 00:51:15.059 align:start position:0%
um yes this is the case management
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
agencies and I also did not have any
 
00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
okay is um are there any questions
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
I have a couple good
 
00:51:28.559 --> 00:51:29.829 align:start position:0%
I have a couple good
um

00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
last year we found out there are
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
multiple definitions of case manager and
 
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
does this conflict with any of them or
 
00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
does it specify exactly what type of
 
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.940 --> 00:52:05.690 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
so this is the licensing requirements
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:18.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
in areas of Sanitation organization
 
00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.270 align:start position:0%
in areas of Sanitation organization
Administration

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
physical environment health and safety
 
00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
nursing Services resident environment
 
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
dietary needs medical records
 
00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:35.750 align:start position:0%
dietary needs medical records
um

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
I had no comments all right
 
00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
I have a question yes for the so
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
essentially what this licensing
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
requirement does is combines all the
 
00:52:49.609 --> 00:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
definitions of this is how I interpreted
 
00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:52.380 align:start position:0%
it that it combines all the definitions
 
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
of case management agencies under one
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
no it's a an amendment
 
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh it's a re-adoption and with Amendment
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
oh I see okay yeah
 
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
um okay last um
 
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
last year when we're talking about it
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
there are multiple types of case
 
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.069 align:start position:0%
there are multiple types of case
management

00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
is which type is does this cover
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
General all-purpose case management
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's the licensing of the agency the the
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
case management agency all right so it's
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
like the whole business correct yeah
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
um and this is and I
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
hello good morning Allison radmay
 
00:53:51.049 --> 00:53:51.059 align:start position:0%
administrator for the administrative
 
00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
rules unit for the Department of Health
 
00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
and Human Services mind that's a moment
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Kelly Keith licensing
 
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
curious why you consider a case
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
it's um in RSA 151 it's described as an
 
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
entity it's actually under the Home
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
Health agencies and that is required to
 
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
be licensed through 151.
 
00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's a requirement for the Department to
 
00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
license these um
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
these case management agencies just as
 
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
we would any other
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
yes but something like
 
00:54:48.049 --> 00:54:48.059 align:start position:0%
sanitation and physical environment I
 
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
mean you're
 
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about a case
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
management agency it doesn't actually
 
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
have residence I would imagine
 
00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
it seems like you're you're conflating
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
it with something much bigger than what
 
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:15.059 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm unclear
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
um or it's unclear are you looking at
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
the notice yes yes
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
maybe you could start by telling us can
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
you define what a case management
 
00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
management agency is that might be
 
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
helpful because yes what is that what
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
does that mean case management agency
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
Dorian Shockley I am the manager of the
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Licensing and certification at
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:41.950 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
Services

00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
earlier this year or last year it's hard
 
00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:46.460 align:start position:0%
to keep track
 
00:55:50.329 --> 00:55:50.339 align:start position:0%
RSA 151 was changed to include case
 
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
management agencies as part I don't have
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
that legislation in front of me the

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
the rule further describes and defines

case manager case management supervision
 
00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
and all of those requirements for those

that are being licensed to your comment
 
00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:47.780 align:start position:0%
chairman McGuire chairwoman McGuire
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
there are many definitions within the
 
00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:53.220 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire regarding case
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
managers there are many for personal
 
00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
care assistance there are I mean there
 
00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:00.059 align:start position:0%
are many definitions period in the state
 
00:57:01.849 --> 00:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that are inconsistent
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
in rules and in law I think it is the
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
Department's overall goal to work
 
00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
collaboratively across the agency to
 
00:57:14.349 --> 00:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that there is consistency
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
we worked very closely with the
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
community of providers that are licensed
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
Incorporated and their input so we
 
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
believe that this is consistent with
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
what the
 
00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
standard definition is there could still
 
00:57:35.809 --> 00:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
be inconsistencies with some rules that
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
we're unaware of but to our knowledge
 
00:57:41.569 --> 00:57:41.579 align:start position:0%
we've Incorporated all of those
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
is this consistent with your correction
 
00:57:46.609 --> 00:57:46.619 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan to separate case
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
management from service providers so
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's not a question I can answer but I
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
have colleagues here that that doesn't
 
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
fall under our Bureau that falls under a
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
different Bureau
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
again again my name is Melissa nemes
 
00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:10.140 align:start position:0%
with the attorney for the Bureau of
 
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
Developmental services and we do not see
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
any conflict between this Rule and the
 
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan thank you
 
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
seems decisive representative Leon thank
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and actually I have
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
another question that you may be the
 
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
right answer for Melissa my question is
 
00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
there are concerns that this may be
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
um be a violation of the conflict of
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
interest so I was curious about the
 
00:58:35.569 --> 00:58:35.579 align:start position:0%
status of the department waiver to
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
continue our conflict the labor of
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
conflict-free case management so the
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
department is under a corrective action
 
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
plan with with CMS to ensure that there
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
is conflict-free case management and our
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
deadline for compliance with that is uh
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
July 1st of this year and we believe
 
00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:56.339 align:start position:0%
that we're on track this rule actually
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
is I think not doesn't really impact
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
that process because there are a variety
 
00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:05.940 align:start position:0%
of other rules and and some preview of
 
00:59:07.849 --> 00:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
Coming Attractions you'll see several of
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
them coming that work on the the all the
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan that the
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
department is under
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
um but this rule specifically doesn't
 
00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
really touch on that we the choice and
 
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
the assurance that people get their free
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
choice of a provider is covered in those
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
other rules versus this rule
 
00:59:29.809 --> 00:59:29.819 align:start position:0%
so would I be correct to understand that
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
the sorry is a follow-up would I be
 
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
correct to understand that the
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
department did not seek a waiver to
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
extend that deadline as I was under the
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
impression the department was going to
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
do that my understanding is that there
 
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
is no waiver being sought for the
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
deadline of July 1st to comply with
 
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
conflict-free case management there are
 
00:59:51.049 --> 00:59:51.059 align:start position:0%
a variety of other initiatives that are
 
00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:53.339 align:start position:0%
going on that fall outside of the
 
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan but I it it is
 
00:59:57.530 --> 00:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
not my knowledge that the department is
 
00:59:59.450 --> 00:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
seeking to waive that July 1st deadline
 
01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
okay thanks good to know any other
 
01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:05.270 align:start position:0%
okay thanks good to know any other
questions

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:09.140 align:start position:0%
concerns all right thank you very much
 
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:28.260 align:start position:0%

01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
with the Department
 
01:00:51.119 --> 01:00:52.190 align:start position:0%
with the Department
um

um
 
01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
and had the opportunity to submit
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
um her comments to them and I think we
 
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
were generally happy with 819
 
01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
however the issues that were raised
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
earlier by this committee regarding
 
01:01:07.559 --> 01:01:08.809 align:start position:0%
earlier by this committee regarding
um

01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
regarding concerns of conflict of
 
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:14.220 align:start position:0%
interest and the current
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan that New
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is under we believe that the
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
scope 81902 and I did hand out
 
01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.109 align:start position:0%
scope 81902 and I did hand out
um

01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
I have some testimony and some
 
01:01:27.359 --> 01:01:28.010 align:start position:0%
I have some testimony and some
um

01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
attachments which I think were emailed
 
01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:32.420 align:start position:0%

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
so I just will highlight
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
briefly here what our concerns are
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
in 819
 
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.430 align:start position:0%
in 819
um

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
in 81902c
 
01:01:48.609 --> 01:01:48.619 align:start position:0%
uh we have a concern
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
regarding that language that all
 
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:54.660 align:start position:0%

01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
the version that we have

the version that we have
Hep

01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:34.940 align:start position:0%
Hep
 
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
819.01 has no subsections
 
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't appear to be in the
 
01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:48.260 align:start position:0%
802 yes
 
01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:51.299 align:start position:0%
81902 oh so it's a typo in your in your
 
01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:53.579 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
I know and I'm sorry just I read that
 
01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
entire thing for you so um anyway so our
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
our issue with that
 
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
um is just that understate and federal
 
01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.089 align:start position:0%
um is just that understate and federal
regulations

01:03:22.089 --> 01:03:22.099 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
case management is provided in these
 
01:03:26.089 --> 01:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
settings as part of the Continuum of
 
01:03:26.099 --> 01:03:27.710 align:start position:0%
settings as part of the Continuum of
Care

01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
Care
 
01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
so those those entities are not case
 
01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:32.930 align:start position:0%
so those those entities are not case
managers

01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
managers
 
01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
well correct that would be that would be
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
um and case management
 
01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:43.140 align:start position:0%
we do case management under CFI right
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
um we are we work with the choices for
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
Independence waiver and we provide case
 
01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
management in these uh in all of these
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
facilities so
 
01:03:55.569 --> 01:03:55.579 align:start position:0%
um and I did cite some law here for you
 
01:03:59.630 --> 01:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:03.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
requires case management to be
 
01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
accessible to all individuals who
 
01:04:11.089 --> 01:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
require or are risk of requiring Nursing
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
I'm reading all over the place I'm sorry
 
01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
this uh this would include patients in
 
01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:27.020 align:start position:0%
these facilities that are listed in
 
01:04:29.809 --> 01:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
81902 C
 
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
M okay so those entities by that rule
 
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
are Exempted from the
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
um this from this rule yeah from
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
licensure requirement
 
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.789 align:start position:0%
licensure requirement
okay

01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
questions representative Schmidt you
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
have a question they're indicating that
 
01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
they just
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
all right yes thank you in that case
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
we'll go on to is that your major
 
01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:58.549 align:start position:0%
we'll go on to is that your major
concern

01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:58.559 --> 01:05:01.250 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
so the major concern would be
 
01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
um which we believe
 
01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:14.690 align:start position:0%
um which we believe
um

01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
allow for a conflict of interest in case
 
01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.289 align:start position:0%
allow for a conflict of interest in case
management

01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:18.299 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
um and that it goes against what CMS
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
requires federal regulations and state
 
01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
statutes regarding case management and
 
01:05:30.049 --> 01:05:30.059 align:start position:0%
the requirement that case management be
 
01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
delivered separate from
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
other services so if you're allowing for
 
01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
um you're allowing for area agencies
 
01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:42.109 align:start position:0%
um you're allowing for area agencies
um

01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:45.059 align:start position:0%
as listed here under e
 
01:05:47.089 --> 01:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
or all entities providing Service
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
Coordination to individuals receiving
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
developmental Disability Services
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
required brain disorder services and
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
you're exempting them from this rule
 
01:05:59.030 --> 01:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
then you're allowing those entities and
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
area agencies to provide case management
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
in coordination with other services
 
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
which is exactly what New Hampshire is
 
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
dealing with right now under the
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan with CMS
 
01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
so I have attached to this testimony a
 
01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:17.780 align:start position:0%
copy of
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
the corrective action plan template and
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
I apologize I believe I only had two
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
copies of that and the rest of the
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
committee members should be in your
 
01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:28.910 align:start position:0%
committee members should be in your
email

01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
email
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of paper to print out
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
this morning so I did attach that and
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
that's that's the issue that we're
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with right now under different
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
waivers so I fear that if you're going
 
01:06:46.609 --> 01:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
because it's it's inconsistent with the
 
01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations so I would say
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
through all of this those are really our
 
01:07:01.849 --> 01:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
major concerns
 
01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
um okay so so your major concern is the
 
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
scope of the rules other than any of the
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
details further down correct okay thank
 
01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
you that helps a little
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman Senator uh
 
01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang so again so I think your
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
your problem is the Case Management
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
Services and the Direct Services need to
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
be separate is what you're saying in
 
01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
this role right and they're not
 
01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
according to this they could be combined
 
01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
into the same agency and that's
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
problematic exactly thank you okay
 
01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you
 
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
Mr plank hey Madam chair thank you
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
Robert click for the record I just
 
01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out somebody made
 
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
mention of the the law last year it was
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 333 and it added um
 
01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
including a Case Management Service
 
01:07:51.289 --> 01:07:51.299 align:start position:0%
provided to a home health care provider
 
01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
and and that's I believe what the the
 
01:07:56.329 --> 01:07:56.339 align:start position:0%
Department was referencing before I just
 
01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
want to make sure everybody knew which
 
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
one it was okay
 
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
did that bill become law yes and it was
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan bill I recall the testimony
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
and the issue very well I just want to
 
01:08:13.609 --> 01:08:13.619 align:start position:0%
make sure it became okay thank you
 
01:08:13.619 --> 01:08:15.589 align:start position:0%
make sure it became okay thank you
representative

01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair that's my question
 
01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
here is
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if you're the right
 
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
people to answer it but my question is
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
um are these case managers being carved
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
out separate from all of these other
 
01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
entities that are licensed just so that
 
01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
there's a license on the case managers
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
who would not otherwise come underneath
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
the scope of oplc
 
01:08:37.799 --> 01:08:38.630 align:start position:0%
the scope of oplc
um

01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
it's a good question it looks more to me
 
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
as though they are exempting
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
case managers in area agents there's
 
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
already an existing scope and they're
 
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
taking people out of the scope
 
01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
we would agree with that what they're
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
doing is they're allowing people to be
 
01:08:56.809 --> 01:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
unlicensed and do the case management
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
work is the way we read the rule that
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
they're trying to implement and I'd like
 
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
to ask the agency why they think it is
 
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
not a conflict of interest for entities
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
area agencies where case management is a
 
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
component of the services provided that
 
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be clearly a conflict of
 
01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:17.630 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be clearly a conflict of
interest

01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
and the same look that in D and E
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
and the future could you explain that to
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
me please I'm I'm not a lawyer but would
 
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
good morning again
 
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
so in the scope uh letter e well letter
 
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
e what used to be letter
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
um f it looks like area agencies were
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
always exempt from the licensure um if
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
they were providing case management and
 
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
the we've added the entities providing
 
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
service coordination and the reason we
 
01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
don't think that this creates a problem
 
01:09:58.970 --> 01:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
with the conflict is there is a separate
 
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
set of rules that govern
 
01:10:04.729 --> 01:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
um the qualifications of service
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
coordinators and we think that it's
 
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
important that it not be
 
01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
captured here it's not that there should
 
01:10:11.890 --> 01:10:11.900 align:start position:0%
not be
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
oversight or any assurances that they
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
are following all of the Federal
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
Regulations it's just that this
 
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
particular rule did not seem to be the
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle to have that included
 
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
um we it cannot be the same agency that
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
provides case management as provides the
 
01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:34.340 align:start position:0%
direct service there is a very limited
 
01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
exception to that that has been approved
 
01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
by CMS that there's already a process
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
for that and in the rules that are going
 
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
to be as I said before There Are Rules
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
coming before you we already have rules
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
around service coordinators in for
 
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
developmental Services
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
Service Coordination is the term that is
 
01:10:56.890 --> 01:10:56.900 align:start position:0%
used for the person that
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
literally coordinates all the services
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
for individuals and because it is a
 
01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:03.950 align:start position:0%
for individuals and because it is a
nuanced

01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
nuanced
 
01:11:06.649 --> 01:11:06.659 align:start position:0%
set of services that are delivered and
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
there are requirements in addition to
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
what might be under 819 for what they
 
01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
need to do the department feels it's
 
01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
important to keep them in in their own
 
01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
rules but have the appropriate oversight
 
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
um so that as I said the department does
 
01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
not see this as any
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
indication that we are not following the
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan it's just that
 
01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
those particular
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
folks providing Service Coordination to
 
01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:32.060 align:start position:0%
this population
 
01:11:34.729 --> 01:11:34.739 align:start position:0%
are better suited to fall under another
 
01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
Rule and have their oversight provided
 
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
there I
 
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
um I take it those are the Hem 403 and
 
01:11:46.729 --> 01:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
505 rules um 503 and 505 yes well then
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
there's a typo in Europe oh 403 I'm
 
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
sorry that's that letter D doesn't apply
 
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
that's for Community Mental Health
 
01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:53.930 align:start position:0%
that's for Community Mental Health
Centers

01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
Centers
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
um so we're not talking about that here
 
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
um AGM 505 is for area agencies hem 503
 
01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
is kind of the general rule for folks
 
01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
entering the developmental Services
 
01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
System and AGM 522 is the rules for
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
folks getting services for an acquired
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
brain disorder
 
01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
represented so can I just make sure that
 
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding what you're saying so
 
01:12:27.490 --> 01:12:27.500 align:start position:0%
you're saying that all the the various
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
agencies or service providers that would
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
be Exempted
 
01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
from 819.02
 
01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
are covered by other
 
01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
uh provisions of of your of law or
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
regulations and those other provisions
 
01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
of law regulations also contain
 
01:12:53.689 --> 01:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
whatever conflict of interest uh uh
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
Provisions they need to contain so that
 
01:12:57.770 --> 01:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
you're not in violation of federal law
 
01:12:59.570 --> 01:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
is that is that correct that's exactly
 
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
correct all right thank you
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
I think these these rules could be
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
worded a little more clearly because as
 
01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
I read d and e it sounds as though the
 
01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
mental health program or the area agency
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
is providing case management and other
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
services which you say is a which seems
 
01:13:21.649 --> 01:13:21.659 align:start position:0%
like a correct a conflict of interest to
 
01:13:21.659 --> 01:13:22.490 align:start position:0%
like a correct a conflict of interest to
me

01:13:22.490 --> 01:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
under uh so I can't the Community Mental
 
01:13:25.729 --> 01:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
Health Centers don't fall under the
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan but for the area
 
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
agencies they actually are able to
 
01:13:33.169 --> 01:13:33.179 align:start position:0%
provide both types of services it just
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
cannot be to the same person so they
 
01:13:37.209 --> 01:13:37.219 align:start position:0%
could provide me with case management
 
01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
and Doreen with Service Coordination but
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
they couldn't provide me with both
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
direct service and Service Coordination
 
01:13:45.719 --> 01:13:47.030 align:start position:0%
direct service and Service Coordination
it's

01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
I repeat that it could be a lot clearer
 
01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
that that's the case
 
01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
because it it doesn't read that way at
 
01:13:56.689 --> 01:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
least not to me
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
representative fellows yes I'm just
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
wondering if do other states use the
 
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:01.850 align:start position:0%
wondering if do other states use the
same

01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:02.530 align:start position:0%
same
um

01:14:02.530 --> 01:14:02.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
definitions and do they use service
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
coordinator and case management to
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
describe the different roles areas New
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire may be different from other
 
01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
states I I don't know specifically I
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
know that under the federal regulations
 
01:14:21.050 --> 01:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
for the waivers that we operate under
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
they actually make it clear in their
 
01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
guidance that the function of case
 
01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
management might be called Service
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
Coordination or something else so it's
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
definitely permissible I don't know
 
01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.970 --> 01:14:39.980 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
 
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
yeah so we have we have time on this
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
rule so I I guess what I'd say is I
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
think it's probably appropriate we
 
01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
postpone this and let until next month
 
01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
let them rewrite that section and make
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
it a little more clearer and cleaner so
 
01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
that it's obvious to what that we don't
 
01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
have any of these conflicts that
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
everyone's talking about yes because
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
since we have been
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
essentially caught with conflicts of
 
01:15:06.530 --> 01:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
interest and we're working on resolving
 
01:15:08.209 --> 01:15:08.219 align:start position:0%
them I think it would be better if we're
 
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
clearer like you say that the area
 
01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
agencies you know don't provide case
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
management and services to the same
 
01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.950 align:start position:0%
management and services to the same
people

01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
this has a motion to postpone yes
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative director Morrow
 
01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:23.630 align:start position:0%
representative director Morrow
um

01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
if the committee is requesting the
 
01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
agency to modify the language it has to
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
be done either through a conditional
 
01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
approval or a preliminary objection with
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
a conditional approval the language
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
needs to be specific in that case a
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
thing a preliminary objection would be
 
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
in order
 
01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:43.140 align:start position:0%
so moved
 
01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
okay that would be based on Clarity yes
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
and public testimony
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:54.719 --> 01:15:56.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
comments all right those in favor of a
 
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection I I opposed
 
01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
all right thank you we'll see what we
 
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
can do about that one
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
Respiratory Care practitioners okay yes
 
01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
ma'am um this proposal would adopt
 
01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
irregular rules um that are currently
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
interim rules which are scheduled to
 
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
expire on May 23rd so next month
 
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
um there are a couple of issues uh one
 
01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
the committee has actually heard about
 
01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
before and that's on page eight of the a
 
01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
PDF document and that's around the
 
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
retention schedule issue and like I said
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
we've discussed that before and my
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is there's currently some
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
legislation that would um address that
 
01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:48.179 align:start position:0%
issue so I wasn't going to spend a lot
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
of time on that the second issue is that
 
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
there has been some testimonies
 
01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
submitted and you do have that at the
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
tail end of your packet and that
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
testimony is on the fact that the rules
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
do not address the licensing of student
 
01:17:08.649 --> 01:17:08.659 align:start position:0%
interns but RSA 541a 22 Roman numeral 3
 
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
B does require specific Authority to
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
issue licenses so an agency needs to
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
have specific authority to be able to do
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
that and the Respiratory Care statute
 
01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any language whatsoever on
 
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
interns or students not their scope of
 
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
practice nothing on licensing
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
requirements just nothing
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
so um so it looks like there's some need
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
for possibly for some legislation to
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
address that issue but again there are
 
01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
some people here who have submitted
 
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
cards and would like to testify on that
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
and with that I I don't have any
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
do you want me to address any of the
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
comments or would you like to let's hear
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
the comments of
 
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.729 align:start position:0%
the comments of
um

01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
got it let's do the comments first and
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
then we'll take the public testimony
 
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
director Mike
 
01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
you have not turned on
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
I turn it on then I turn it off I
 
01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
apologize uh for the record Lindsay
 
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
Courtney executive director oplc
 
01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the retention
 
01:18:23.689 --> 01:18:23.699 align:start position:0%
schedule issue I think this issue has
 
01:18:26.209 --> 01:18:26.219 align:start position:0%
probably been discussed before
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
um we did go through the Secretary of
 
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
State's office took about a year to get
 
01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
approval what is posted on our website
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
is the format that they sent back to me
 
01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
I recognize that it may require
 
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
additional Clarity but did not feel that
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
it was within our purview to deviate
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
from what was approved by the Secretary
 
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
of State's office additionally I do not
 
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
believe that oplc has rulemaking
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
authority over retention schedules
 
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
rather our statute requires us to adopt
 
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
a policy in accordance with the
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
secretary of state requirements
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State obviously needs to
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
conduct rulemaking and once that is done
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
we will be sure to follow those
 
01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirements with respect to
 
01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:05.060 align:start position:0%
the student licensure issue we have
 
01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
thoroughly reviewed this from a legal
 
01:19:09.169 --> 01:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
standpoint with multiple attorneys in
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
the office my understanding is that and
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you will and I defer to others
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
to explain the basis for it I have no
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
objection to the policy reasons why we
 
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
would may want to consider licensure
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
students my understanding is it's it's
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
really from a reimbursement standpoint
 
01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
but our position is that we do not have
 
01:19:33.649 --> 01:19:33.659 align:start position:0%
legal authority to do so
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
um we considered uh maybe seeking
 
01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
legislation this past session but given
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
the climate of licensure changes did not
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
think that this was the right session to
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
do so and therefore happy to regroup
 
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders and or legislators for
 
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
next session if that is desirable but
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
from a policy standpoint did not believe
 
01:19:59.090 --> 01:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
that this was the right opportunity to
 
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
bring this up
 
01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
questions for the director
 
01:20:13.729 --> 01:20:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:15.659 align:start position:0%
are you together sir
 
01:20:15.659 --> 01:20:16.729 align:start position:0%

01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
more or less
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%

01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
member so I'm not exactly
 
01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:45.659 align:start position:0%
good at how this whole process works uh
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
I had asked a couple of other members of
 
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapy within our state so
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
I have there's three of us here today to
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
represent student licensure and a few
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
other questions that we had
 
01:21:00.239 --> 01:21:03.649 align:start position:0%
other questions that we had
um

01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
this is Patrick Montano going to start
 
01:21:06.719 --> 01:21:08.030 align:start position:0%
this is Patrick Montano going to start
sure

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:09.719 align:start position:0%
hi so my name is Patrick I'm a
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
respiratory therapist
 
01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
um before we go into the student
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
licensure section that I had a lot of
 
01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
questions regarding verbage and wording
 
01:21:18.649 --> 01:21:18.659 align:start position:0%
of this and it became clear to me that
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
um respiratory therapists weren't
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
involved in the creation of these rules
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
so when I reached out to people on from
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
The Advisory Board who I know I asked
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
them if they were involved in the OR
 
01:21:28.729 --> 01:21:28.739 align:start position:0%
vetting these rules and they told me
 
01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
they were not so I don't know if that is
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
accurate or not but there are a lot of
 
01:21:34.010 --> 01:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
questions regarding education
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
requirements what is able to be used for
 
01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
continuing education credits when I
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
wrote reached out to oplc to ask them
 
01:21:43.130 --> 01:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
for clarification specifically with a
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
1507.07a asking with Healthcare
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
leadership classes could be considered
 
01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
for that rule they told me it depends on
 
01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
if it's covered by the rule or not was
 
01:21:56.630 --> 01:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
the answer I got so
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if this has been fully
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
vetted and I guess that's why I'm asking
 
01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
you guys to postpone the approval here
 
01:22:04.729 --> 01:22:04.739 align:start position:0%
as far as Respiratory Care licensure for
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
students okay right so
 
01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.669 align:start position:0%
students okay right so
um

01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
so you're concerned about the
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirements yeah a
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
lot of the continu they were vague to me
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
as what was accepted it was 1507 dot
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
sorry 1507.07 a
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
specifically I asked if Healthcare
 
01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
leadership classes would be able to be
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
used for that and the oplc could not
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
tell me if they would accept that or not
 
01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
okay it says they are either
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
that does appear a little Vega who has
 
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
to approve them because any Statewide
 
01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.110 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:58.090 align:start position:0%
um
than

01:22:58.090 --> 01:22:58.100 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
1507.09 a there is other examinations
 
01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
that are very relevant to the profession
 
01:23:05.450 --> 01:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
of Respiratory Care higher Level
 
01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
examinations such as the ECMO also has a
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
e a e Dash aec certification which is uh
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
extraordial membrane oxygenation
 
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
certification which is a higher end
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
therapy that would be relevant here that
 
01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
so a bunch of questions about that and
 
01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
that's when I got into the fact that you
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
know The Advisory Board wasn't consulted
 
01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
in these rules okay that's concerning
 
01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
as far as student licensures go I guess
 
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
the one of the questions I have about
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
student licensure is actually
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
1506.02 actually talks about student
 
01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.970 align:start position:0%
1506.02 actually talks about student
interns

01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
interns
 
01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
specifically so I'm not sure they're not
 
01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
licensed interns but it comments on that
 
01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:52.250 align:start position:0%
licensed interns but it comments on that
1506.

01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
1506.
 
01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:55.610 align:start position:0%
1506.
O2

01:23:55.610 --> 01:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.649 --> 01:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.050 --> 01:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
okay it specifically says that a person
 
01:24:06.290 --> 01:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
may be
 
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
may work as an intern without a license
 
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
if you're enrolled in a program to
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
educate that meets the requirements of
 
01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:15.290 align:start position:0%
educate that meets the requirements of
the

01:24:15.290 --> 01:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
um so the vacation areas are we allowed
 
01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
to pay these interns are they allowed to
 
01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:20.219 align:start position:0%
perform independently or are these
 
01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:21.620 align:start position:0%
actually just student
 
01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
internships where they are actually
 
01:24:27.169 --> 01:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
supervised it's not clear uh that
 
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear to deny independent
 
01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.430 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear to deny independent
practice

01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
okay that was not how I read it it says
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
may engage inactive normally undertaken
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
by a
 
01:24:40.729 --> 01:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
Uh I that does appear to be a little
 
01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
vague okay and then as far as
 
01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
um so that's kind of what brought me
 
01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
into thinking that student licensure
 
01:24:48.110 --> 01:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
would be able to be approved by the RSA
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
and possibly it's not but I just want to
 
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
put a little bit of the scope of the
 
01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
problem of Respiratory Care so while you
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
know you've heard about Healthcare
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
shortages nationally nursing programs
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
are fully enrolled right they are filled
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
Radiology programs are filled currently
 
01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
hospitals or the larger hospitals that
 
01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
we represent are about 30 percent down
 
01:25:07.930 --> 01:25:07.940 align:start position:0%
with our employment
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
enrollment in RT programs is down 63
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
nationally so that's 63 vacancies
 
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
including our local Claremont program of
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
that we are expected to grow 14 in the
 
01:25:20.689 --> 01:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
next 10 years
 
01:25:22.189 --> 01:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
of the students that are in the
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
Claremont program most of them are
 
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
getting student jobs in Vermont because
 
01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
they're right on the border and then
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
when they're graduating they're actually
 
01:25:29.689 --> 01:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
going to work in Vermont instead of New
 
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospitals because they've
 
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
already built a relationship with their
 
01:25:33.649 --> 01:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
employers there
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
and could you explain why they're
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
working in Vermont rather than New
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because in Vermont they're
 
01:25:40.729 --> 01:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
allowed to work as student respiratory
 
01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:44.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
this yeah okay so they don't uh Vermont
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
actually Maine and Massachusetts all
 
01:25:51.169 --> 01:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
have student rules we're the only one
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't Okay and and it is assumed
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
that an internship means there's no pick
 
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding okay thank you
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's I don't believe that's always the
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
case but if that's what people assume
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
that's uh yeah I would love to hear
 
01:26:07.199 --> 01:26:10.689 align:start position:0%
that's uh yeah I would love to hear
otherwise

01:26:10.689 --> 01:26:10.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
yes so I'm I'm guilty of being Married
 
01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:15.780 align:start position:0%
to Medicine so
 
01:26:18.169 --> 01:26:18.179 align:start position:0%
um yes I think it's kind of an industry
 
01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:20.219 align:start position:0%
practice that if you're in an internship
 
01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
in a hospital or Healthcare setting that
 
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
you are receiving compensation for that
 
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
pay or that that labor so even if it is
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
supervised learning
 
01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
um that there is a lot of work that goes
 
01:26:35.050 --> 01:26:35.060 align:start position:0%
into that so okay I think
 
01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
proposing to train someone without
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
paying them it seems really unreasonable
 
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
 it's not competitive that's for
 
01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
sure right well we can't skip the
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement that we have to
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
have approval for that license
 
01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.370 align:start position:0%
have approval for that license
but

01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:58.490 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.870 --> 01:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's like it's my ask of the committee
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
and you can speak after I'm done sorry
 
01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh would be that you would propose
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
postpone these roles and ask the oplc to
 
01:27:07.610 --> 01:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
involve the Respiratory Care Advisory
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
Board in re-working them and making sure
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
that the veganies have been made clear
 
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair yes the interim rules
 
01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
expire on May 23rd the committee is
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
meeting on May 19th so that's pretty
 
01:27:24.649 --> 01:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
tight you could do a preliminary
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
objection but
 
01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
um again you know the the interim rules
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
will expire
 
01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:32.390 align:start position:0%
will expire
um

01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
on the 20th we're meeting on the 19th
 
01:27:35.159 --> 01:27:37.490 align:start position:0%
on the 20th we're meeting on the 19th
right

01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
I think the we that should allow us time
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
to get a little Clarity on your other
 
01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:45.229 align:start position:0%
to get a little Clarity on your other
questions

01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
about the Education and Training the
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
part about the student licenses we can't
 
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
solve immediately so we let's not worry
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
about it for the time being
 
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
um even we'll if we can think of
 
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
I think one and as far as the the
 
01:28:08.570 --> 01:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
clarification on the internship if
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to work I guess the
 
01:28:11.209 --> 01:28:11.219 align:start position:0%
clarification I would be seeking is are
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
they allowed to work independently and
 
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
are they allowed to be paid
 
01:28:17.629 --> 01:28:17.639 align:start position:0%
the independent part certainly could be
 
01:28:21.169 --> 01:28:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh actually the pay too I mean I don't
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
see why it it should be mandatory that
 
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
they're not paid
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
right I think our historical assumption
 
01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
is that has been for students who come
 
01:28:33.770 --> 01:28:33.780 align:start position:0%
from education programs and that is
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
while they're with us doing their
 
01:28:36.649 --> 01:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
clinical time
 
01:28:39.169 --> 01:28:39.179 align:start position:0%
okay well it sounds like a number of
 
01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%
clarity issues that the Board needs to
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
be more involved in would a uh do we
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
need to give a preliminary objection or
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
should we just postpone the decision you
 
01:28:50.689 --> 01:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
could postpone
 
01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
um one other issue I was going to um
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
just highlight is that in the definition
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
of Respiratory Care in the statute there
 
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
is the concept of supervision of a less
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
skilled person in Respiratory Care but
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
really that's the only place where where
 
01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
you could kind of highlight there being
 
01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
a student or somebody not qualified to
 
01:29:13.490 --> 01:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
perform Respiratory Care unlicensed
 
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:15.410 align:start position:0%
perform Respiratory Care unlicensed
right

01:29:15.410 --> 01:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
just so whatever so I pulled up the the
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
exemption licensure statute and it does
 
01:29:24.649 --> 01:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
say in there that it says related to a
 
01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
person's Respiratory Care education
 
01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:28.139 align:start position:0%
while under the direct supervision of a
 
01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
respiratory care practitioner or
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
physician so in the RSA itself it
 
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
defines that a person working under
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
there well they don't have to be
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
licensed they do have to be working
 
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
under the direct
 
01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
supervision of a respiratory care
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
practitioner or physician
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
if I may Madam chair I would like to
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
address the notice issue
 
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
so these rules are largely based on the
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
interim rules which obviously went
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
through notice procedure which were
 
01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
largely based on the prior rules we did
 
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
not receive a lot of feedback during the
 
01:30:00.649 --> 01:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
interim rule making but we did receive
 
01:30:02.450 --> 01:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
feedback after the fact and I do believe
 
01:30:04.129 --> 01:30:04.139 align:start position:0%
that these rules went through an
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
advanced public comment period meaning
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
that we we requested it comments prior
 
01:30:12.410 --> 01:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
to initiating a formal rulemaking we did
 
01:30:14.689 --> 01:30:14.699 align:start position:0%
receive significant comments
 
01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
particularly on the issue as it relates
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
to equipment because previously under
 
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
the prior rules one had to be licensed
 
01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
in order to basically manage and install
 
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:27.900 align:start position:0%
equipment so we've responded to those
 
01:30:29.629 --> 01:30:29.639 align:start position:0%
comments and you can see that at the end
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
of our filing
 
01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
I I take issue with the representation
 
01:30:36.649 --> 01:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
that we did not seek stakeholder input
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at our
 
01:30:41.570 --> 01:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
websites all of the Respiratory Care
 
01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
meetings in 2022 were canceled we are
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
happy to work with stakeholders moving
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
forward on these issues including
 
01:30:50.689 --> 01:30:50.699 align:start position:0%
seeking a statutory change but given
 
01:30:52.010 --> 01:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
that the interim rules are about to
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
expire do not believe that it's in the
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
best position for licensees that we
 
01:30:58.370 --> 01:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
postpone these rules rather I'd like
 
01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
them to go forward and then we can
 
01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
re-initiate rulemaking if necessary with
 
01:31:08.090 --> 01:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
so I
 
01:31:12.410 --> 01:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
have questions yes so can I can I just
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh am I understanding what what you're
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
basically saying is that that although
 
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
the people we heard from a moment ago
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
are kind of complaining now they had
 
01:31:22.490 --> 01:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
plenty of opportunity to have their
 
01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:24.540 align:start position:0%
input and they didn't take advantage of
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
it then is that what you're saying
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
yes and I think we can always do more
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
communication but the fact that we
 
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
communicated is supported by the fact
 
01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
that people did provide comments that we
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
responded to as is listed in your packet
 
01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
does someone have motion
 
01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
I'm chair I'm going to move to a proof
 
01:31:53.570 --> 01:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to speak to my motion when
 
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
I'm done all right is there a second
 
01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:56.470 align:start position:0%
I'm done all right is there a second
second

01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:31:59.629 --> 01:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
so again I I think the combination on
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
the student licensing it's clear that
 
01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:03.719 align:start position:0%
there is no provision for oplc to issue
 
01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
a license or create they can't create a
 
01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
license out of thin air unless
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
authorized by the legislature so there's
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
nothing they can do to create a
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
licensure that would allow an intern or
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
student to act and the statute's clear
 
01:32:15.050 --> 01:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
that they have to act in the
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
supervisions I don't know that there's
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
any necessary Clarity that's needed
 
01:32:19.129 --> 01:32:19.139 align:start position:0%
there unless for some reason we want to
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
license them but
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
um as to the
 
01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:23.410 align:start position:0%
um as to the
um

01:32:23.410 --> 01:32:23.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
the continuing education requirements
 
01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
and those conditions again I I think the
 
01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
agency's been clear that they are more
 
01:32:33.890 --> 01:32:33.900 align:start position:0%
than willing to reopen rule making but
 
01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
the interim rules are about to expire we
 
01:32:36.890 --> 01:32:36.900 align:start position:0%
need to move forward so that the license
 
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
the rule itself doesn't expire any and
 
01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
the profession is injured or harmed
 
01:32:43.970 --> 01:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt actually
 
01:32:45.890 --> 01:32:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn can speak to a
 
01:32:48.050 --> 01:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
second first so you know I agree with
 
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
everything that Senator Lang said the
 
01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
only thing I would say is
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
um uh well it while the statute that he
 
01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
read I think does make it clear that
 
01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
they that the the uh a student needs to
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
be operating under the direct
 
01:33:02.090 --> 01:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
supervision of a licensee I'm not sure
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
that there's anything in the law unless
 
01:33:06.110 --> 01:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
there's another provision that hasn't
 
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
been referred to that would prevent a
 
01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
student from being paid
 
01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that's something that
 
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure that that would even
 
01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
need to necessarily be covered by uh by
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
regulation I think it's just up to the
 
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
you know the the employer to decide
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
whether they want to pay somebody and it
 
01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
probably it sounds like given what the
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
competitive situation that it might make
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
sense to start paying them but uh I
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
don't know that we need a regulation for
 
01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
that so anyway I I but I I agree with
 
01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:40.129 --> 01:33:40.139 align:start position:0%
thank you and I agree with the previous
 
01:33:41.709 --> 01:33:41.719 align:start position:0%
speaker's statement
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
and would the senator uh
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
consider amending his motion uh slightly
 
01:33:51.890 --> 01:33:51.900 align:start position:0%
to encourage uh further legislative
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
further legislation because it seems to
 
01:33:56.689 --> 01:33:56.699 align:start position:0%
me like the statute could be improved
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
but I agree with your characterization
 
01:34:03.530 --> 01:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
so again I I I'm sure Mike made a list
 
01:34:08.330 --> 01:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
of legislative recommendations and
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
changes and I don't necessarily know it
 
01:34:12.050 --> 01:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
needs to be an emotion itself
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so I I would think it would
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
probably be better
 
01:34:20.810 --> 01:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
I mean to If a person is
 
01:34:23.689 --> 01:34:23.699 align:start position:0%
a student but wants to be paid they
 
01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
could be paid as some sort of medical
 
01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:27.250 align:start position:0%
could be paid as some sort of medical
technician

01:34:27.250 --> 01:34:27.260 align:start position:0%
technician
 
01:34:30.649 --> 01:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
and work under the direct supervision of
 
01:34:33.890 --> 01:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
a uh of a licensed practitioner which I
 
01:34:36.669 --> 01:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
because the intern is allowed to to work
 
01:34:44.689 --> 01:34:44.699 align:start position:0%
into without direct supervision so I
 
01:34:46.850 --> 01:34:46.860 align:start position:0%
would think that if you're trying to get
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
on the job experience
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
for yours for the sake of the profession
 
01:34:53.629 --> 01:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
you would not want to just say oh here
 
01:34:59.090 --> 01:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
director uh Madam chairman
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
based on personal belief uh I I think
 
01:35:08.209 --> 01:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
it's common that interns would be paid
 
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
but I think uh one factor in that maybe
 
01:35:13.729 --> 01:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
the educational institution that the
 
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
student is at I understand it in some
 
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
instances if the internship is going to
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
if the intern is going to receive credit
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
from the school the school may say you
 
01:35:27.649 --> 01:35:27.659 align:start position:0%
cannot be paid
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
ah okay well that's
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
if that's the case then that's up to the
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
school to consider if that's affecting
 
01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
the uh but there is no Prohibition in
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
the rule itself from the individuals
 
01:35:44.209 --> 01:35:44.219 align:start position:0%
being paid
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I know
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
ages ago when uh when I worked as an
 
01:35:53.229 --> 01:35:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
that was a long long time ago
 
01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
so I I just um before we have emotion
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just I have a question about the can
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
the comment that the continuing
 
01:36:08.209 --> 01:36:08.219 align:start position:0%
education section was vague is that
 
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
going to be addressed
 
01:36:13.729 --> 01:36:13.739 align:start position:0%
uh I would it sounded to me as though it
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
was more incomplete and
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
it director Courtney is there a way for
 
01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
the board to add additional
 
01:36:23.219 --> 01:36:24.590 align:start position:0%
the board to add additional
courses

01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
courses
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
for continuing education approval
 
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
I think that the um the requirements are
 
01:36:33.649 --> 01:36:33.659 align:start position:0%
intended to be fairly broad so that
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
um more courses can meet the
 
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
requirements I think part of the issue
 
01:36:38.689 --> 01:36:38.699 align:start position:0%
we run into when people ask us questions
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
like would this qualify without having
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
the course before us we can't really say
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know conduct an analysis as to
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not it would meet those
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirements and we're not
 
01:36:51.169 --> 01:36:51.179 align:start position:0%
really in a position to be giving legal
 
01:36:53.689 --> 01:36:53.699 align:start position:0%
advice in advance of reviewing that
 
01:36:53.699 --> 01:36:54.590 align:start position:0%
advice in advance of reviewing that
um

01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:56.930 --> 01:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
um before you know before it's submitted
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
so I think that
 
01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
um Our advice to words is typically to
 
01:37:04.129 --> 01:37:04.139 align:start position:0%
keep it you know fairly broad to capture
 
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
all of the types of continuing education
 
01:37:09.649 --> 01:37:09.659 align:start position:0%
that you think could fulfill those
 
01:37:11.649 --> 01:37:11.659 align:start position:0%
applications rather than creating
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
discrete categories that would exclude
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
things you might otherwise think as
 
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
valuable education but you can approve
 
01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
yeah non-specifically listed courses yes
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
correct okay good that's the important
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
thing thank you I'd like to mention to
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
the therapists that these rules are
 
01:37:31.129 --> 01:37:31.139 align:start position:0%
normally written by lawyers and they do
 
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
things differently than the rest of us
 
01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:34.850 align:start position:0%
things differently than the rest of us
so

01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:34.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
if you have specific courses you want to
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
get approved that's
 
01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
sound like that you should go ahead and
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
ask for them to be included
 
01:37:48.110 --> 01:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
okay in that case we have a motion to
 
01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.370 align:start position:0%
okay in that case we have a motion to
approve

01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
approve
 
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.689 --> 01:38:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
um so this is an interim Rule and for
 
01:38:10.729 --> 01:38:10.739 align:start position:0%
the newer committee members that means
 
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
that if it is approved it will be valid
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
only for 180 days to allow the agency to
 
01:38:18.669 --> 01:38:18.679 align:start position:0%
engage in the regular rulemaking process
 
01:38:21.649 --> 01:38:21.659 align:start position:0%
this is a straight adoption of a new
 
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
section uh
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
safe the 9100 section on the rules for
 
01:38:32.209 --> 01:38:32.219 align:start position:0%
Carriage of household goods by Motor
 
01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:35.219 align:start position:0%
Vehicles this is in result to a new
 
01:38:38.410 --> 01:38:38.420 align:start position:0%
statute are say 359 T
 
01:38:41.689 --> 01:38:41.699 align:start position:0%
that statute actually encompasses some
 
01:38:43.850 --> 01:38:43.860 align:start position:0%
of the prior requirements that were
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
under RSA 375a but 375a was repealed
 
01:38:51.229 --> 01:38:51.239 align:start position:0%
when this new statute went into effect
 
01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
um so a number of the comments um on the
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
interim rule can be addressed during the
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process
 
01:39:01.129 --> 01:39:01.139 align:start position:0%
um but at this time
 
01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
um we want to bring it up now so that it
 
01:39:04.729 --> 01:39:04.739 align:start position:0%
can be addressed in the regular rule
 
01:39:07.090 --> 01:39:07.100 align:start position:0%
making process or if the committee
 
01:39:09.050 --> 01:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
determines that they're too big of an
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
issues that they need to be addressed um
 
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
before that
 
01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:16.860 align:start position:0%
so the first issue is actually a note to
 
01:39:20.209 --> 01:39:20.219 align:start position:0%
GL car on the top of page one of the
 
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
rule so because there was a previous
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
statute with similar requirement or
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
similar language the agency already had
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
some rules in place under 4 600 that
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
they used
 
01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
most of the language for some of the
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
rule requirements under 4600 are
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
identical or very similar to what is now
 
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
going to be 9100 but at this time the 4
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
600 rules there's still an effect so
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
would they have been repealed and when
 
01:39:57.110 --> 01:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
the statute was repealed there as far as
 
01:40:01.129 --> 01:40:01.139 align:start position:0%
I could see there was no language in the
 
01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:04.679 align:start position:0%
statute the repeal of the statute or the
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
um new statute that resulted in those
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
rules becoming non-effective and because
 
01:40:14.050 --> 01:40:14.060 align:start position:0%
they have the authority now under five
 
01:40:17.090 --> 01:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
359 T which I said are pretty much
 
01:40:19.729 --> 01:40:19.739 align:start position:0%
similar that that would transfer to that
 
01:40:19.739 --> 01:40:21.410 align:start position:0%
similar that that would transfer to that
statute

01:40:21.410 --> 01:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
um so there is a bit of a
 
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
issue of which rules are going to be
 
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
effective if the 9100s come are approved
 
01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
today you have two sets of rules that
 
01:40:35.689 --> 01:40:35.699 align:start position:0%
are effective at the same time
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
um so perhaps the agency can discuss if
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
they have plans to address that or maybe
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
come up with a plan to address that
 
01:40:46.129 --> 01:40:46.139 align:start position:0%
the second substantive comment is on
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
page three of the rule text it's under
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
the part titled estimates
 
01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:52.610 align:start position:0%
the part titled estimates
um

01:40:52.610 --> 01:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:55.610 --> 01:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
the rules specifically states that the
 
01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
carrier shall not charge the customer
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
any amount which exceeds 10 without the
 
01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
customer's written consent
 
01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
however it's unclear from the rules face
 
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
what that 10 is based off of it may be
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
inferred that the agency intends it to
 
01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
be based on the estimate but with regard
 
01:41:16.729 --> 01:41:16.739 align:start position:0%
to the standards the rule making that's
 
01:41:16.739 --> 01:41:18.169 align:start position:0%
to the standards the rule making that's
not

01:41:18.169 --> 01:41:18.179 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:41:22.010 --> 01:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
clear enough it should be they should be
 
01:41:23.930 --> 01:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
stating what exactly that 10 is going to
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
be based upon
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
the next comment is on page four of the
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
rule text that section regards voluntary
 
01:41:34.010 --> 01:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
suspensions the role text is not clear
 
01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
on what the department will consider
 
01:41:39.770 --> 01:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
when determining if they will allow a
 
01:41:42.890 --> 01:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
carrier to voluntarily suspend its
 
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
certificate or permit whether the agency
 
01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
is going to just automatically Grant it
 
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
as soon as they get the request or if
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's going to be criteria that
 
01:41:53.629 --> 01:41:53.639 align:start position:0%
they're going to be considering
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
additionally it's not clear when they
 
01:41:58.850 --> 01:41:58.860 align:start position:0%
will make this determination especially
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
if there's an ongoing adjudicatory
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
process because the under these rules
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
the agency can also revoke a carrier's
 
01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
permit or certificate after the
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory process has completed so if
 
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
a carrier
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
puts in a request to voluntarily suspend
 
01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:18.530 align:start position:0%
puts in a request to voluntarily suspend
after

01:42:18.530 --> 01:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
the hearing has already
 
01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
finished and the department is
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
considering whether to revoke how are
 
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
they going to determine if they're
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
revoking or voluntarily suspending
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh the next couple of comments have to
 
01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
do with the agency's forms there are
 
01:42:37.609 --> 01:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
three forms that are uh that accompany
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
this particular rule
 
01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
um and none of them are Incorporated by
 
01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
reference so a majority of the comments
 
01:42:47.209 --> 01:42:47.219 align:start position:0%
have to do with inconsistencies between
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
the forms and the rule text and I can go
 
01:42:53.090 --> 01:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
into the specific comments that the
 
01:42:55.149 --> 01:42:55.159 align:start position:0%
committee wants no no because the
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies between the form and the
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
rule are the kind of thing I expect them
 
01:43:01.129 --> 01:43:01.139 align:start position:0%
to deal with in regular rulemaking okay
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
so that would be the remainder of my
 
01:43:04.729 --> 01:43:04.739 align:start position:0%
comments okay
 
01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:08.689 --> 01:43:08.699 align:start position:0%
hey good morning Aaron Johnson uh
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
administrative rules coordinator with
 
01:43:12.290 --> 01:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety uh for the
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
first comment addressing the fact that
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to have two different uh
 
01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
sets of rules in place uh it's the
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
Department's understanding that it is
 
01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
unclear based off of the uh the bill
 
01:43:26.330 --> 01:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
that had passed whether or not the 4600s
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
are still in effect so our goal is to
 
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
put the 9100s into um interim rules and
 
01:43:37.370 --> 01:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
we've actually gained a lot of comments
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
just from OLS over this you know that we
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
want to address in the 4600s which uh we
 
01:43:45.770 --> 01:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
will continue doing that with regular
 
01:43:49.850 --> 01:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
rulemaking under the 4600s based off of
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
the approval of the 9100s but it sounds
 
01:43:56.570 --> 01:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
like you're going backwards yeah isn't
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
the 9100s the new rules they are the new
 
01:44:03.890 --> 01:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
rules for interim and we intend to adopt
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
the regular rules under the 4600s we
 
01:44:08.570 --> 01:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
just wanted the interim rules in place
 
01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
while we
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
figure out how to address the 4600s with
 
01:44:18.530 --> 01:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.770 --> 01:44:23.780 align:start position:0%
okay is anyone else confused so uh we
 
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess to kind of clarify uh we we
 
01:44:30.169 --> 01:44:30.179 align:start position:0%
weren't sure whether or not the 4600s
 
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
really did have any effect and we're
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
still working on drafting the language
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
for the regular rulemaking so we decided
 
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
to do the interim rules under 9100
 
01:44:44.090 --> 01:44:44.100 align:start position:0%
because if let's say we get these
 
01:44:46.250 --> 01:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
adopted and we have six months if we
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
don't adopt the regular rules within
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
that six month period then that would
 
01:44:53.450 --> 01:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
essentially Wipe Out the interim rules
 
01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
and then the regular rules would
 
01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
disappear as well and since we're
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
unclear whether or not we still have
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
Authority Under the 4600s we we want to
 
01:45:04.609 --> 01:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
reserve the right to be able to revert
 
01:45:07.609 --> 01:45:07.619 align:start position:0%
back in the in the instance that we
 
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
don't have the regular rulemaking
 
01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:10.669 align:start position:0%
don't have the regular rulemaking
finalized

01:45:10.669 --> 01:45:10.679 align:start position:0%
finalized
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
ah so the that's not the normal PC so
 
01:45:18.189 --> 01:45:18.199 align:start position:0%
you're putting these these rules in as a
 
01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
six-month temporary rule to cover the
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
fact that you're going to be making
 
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
changes in the other rules about
 
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
about carriers is that correct correct
 
01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:29.649 align:start position:0%
about carriers is that correct correct
okay

01:45:29.649 --> 01:45:29.659 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:45:32.689 --> 01:45:32.699 align:start position:0%
uh if there is a conflict between the
 
01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
two sets of rules which takes precedence
 
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
the Department's going to take uh the
 
01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
9100s as precedent
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
then I would strongly recommend that you
 
01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
add that in case of conflict with the
 
01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
4600 rules these rules apply okay the
 
01:45:54.169 --> 01:45:54.179 align:start position:0%
department that definitely needs to be
 
01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
added to the rule
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else representative
 
01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:04.930 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else representative
um

01:46:04.930 --> 01:46:04.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.330 --> 01:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that in hindsight the
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
thing to do if this was to implement new
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
legislation that the appropriate thing
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
was to amend
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
um 4600 through an interim rule I do
 
01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
understand that the question was about
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
the validity up and I mean if the
 
01:46:27.370 --> 01:46:27.380 align:start position:0%
statute that was that
 
01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
4600 Implement has
 
01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
gone away then I think there could be a
 
01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
presumption that 4 600 is not
 
01:46:38.229 --> 01:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
enforceable anymore
 
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
I know it's a rather unusual instance
 
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
here where there's a similar statute
 
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to apply but it seems like
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
they should just have should have just
 
01:46:54.050 --> 01:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
done 4 600 again or as they could as
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
part of the regular rulemaking repeal
 
01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:04.490 --> 01:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:47:06.530 --> 01:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
would make it clear where the authority
 
01:47:07.729 --> 01:47:07.739 align:start position:0%
is but
 
01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
I think our request is that you figure
 
01:47:12.590 --> 01:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
out what the permanent
 
01:47:15.890 --> 01:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
rule is what the Authority for it is and
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
make it clear to everybody because
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
you've got the whole room full of people
 
01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:21.649 align:start position:0%
you've got the whole room full of people
confused

01:47:21.649 --> 01:47:21.659 align:start position:0%
confused
 
01:47:24.649 --> 01:47:24.659 align:start position:0%
Center so again I'm assuming the agency
 
01:47:28.729 --> 01:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
is okay with adding to 9101 or 9100 that
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
language that 9100 takes precedent over
 
01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
4 600 if there is a conflict because
 
01:47:36.890 --> 01:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
we're still unsure which whether 4600 is
 
01:47:38.570 --> 01:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
a valid but if there is a conflict and
 
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
it's determined it is valid that 9100 is
 
01:47:43.850 --> 01:47:43.860 align:start position:0%
the precedent not or the standard not
 
01:47:46.729 --> 01:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
4600 are you okay with that edit to the
 
01:47:52.010 --> 01:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
and I think the question about the
 
01:47:58.250 --> 01:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
10 again
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
yes so that is going to be 10 of the
 
01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
original estimate that a household
 
01:48:06.169 --> 01:48:06.179 align:start position:0%
carrier uh would provide to the customer
 
01:48:09.410 --> 01:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
before signing a contract so we'll we'll
 
01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
just need to add that language in there
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
to specify that it's of the original
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
estimate and that's something no that's
 
01:48:16.970 --> 01:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
actually it's going to be 110 of the
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
original estimate I guess 110 of the
 
01:48:22.490 --> 01:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
original estimate okay
 
01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:24.129 align:start position:0%
original estimate okay
so

01:48:24.129 --> 01:48:24.139 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
move to conditionally approved
 
01:48:30.129 --> 01:48:30.139 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:48:32.930 --> 01:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
any further comments questions
 
01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:36.709 align:start position:0%
any further comments questions
discussion

01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
aye aye
 
01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
those opposed
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
no one thank you very much and uh good
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
luck with your rulemaking
 
01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:50.990 align:start position:0%
luck with your rulemaking
yes

01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:48:53.209 --> 01:48:53.219 align:start position:0%
it's from all of us I think whichever
 
01:48:55.810 --> 01:48:55.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:04.010 --> 01:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
no Madam chairman we could uh determine
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the continued meeting
 
01:49:09.290 --> 01:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
I believe that would would make sense
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes no continued meeting in that case
 
01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
unless there's an objection we'll
 
01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:32.810 align:start position:0%
unless there's an objection we'll
adjourn

01:49:32.810 --> 01:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
