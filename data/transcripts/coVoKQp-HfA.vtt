00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
testing one two
 
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
this meeting will start in one or two
 
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
minutes we're waiting for the prime
 
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the first bill we're going to
 
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
hear in public hearing and so we'll
 
00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 align:start position:0%
delay the start of the meeting until the
 
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
okay ladies and gentlemen I think we'll
 
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
get started uh there's some confusion
 
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.350 align:start position:0%
get started uh there's some confusion
about

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
who will introduce the first bill at
 
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
there there may be some confusion about
 
00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
the room because originally this meeting
 
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 align:start position:0%
was scheduled to be in a room downstairs
 
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
it got revised so that we could meet
 
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
here and some people may not have gotten
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
the message
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
if you wouldn't mind thank you so we're
 
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
going to double check uh
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure we didn't lose some folks
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
by having them go to the wrong room
 
00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:03.350 align:start position:0%
by having them go to the wrong room
and

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
when we get an assurance that everybody
 
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
who is supposed to be here is in fact
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:53.700 align:start position:0%
for those of you waiting or watching at
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
home we're waiting for the prime sponsor
 
00:09:59.810 --> 00:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
of this bill to make an appearance
 
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
we'll wait another few minutes if uh
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
representative cretian
 
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
does not appear then we will
 
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
have someone else introduce the bill
 
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
so please be patient for another minute
 
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
okay we have uh verified that there are
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
no people in the wrong room
 
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.150 align:start position:0%
no people in the wrong room
so

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:35.459 align:start position:0%
and no bills or anything else
 
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
the clerk is looking for me
 
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
oh the clerk is looking for the bill the
 
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
bills okay
 
00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
so it would appear that we can begin
 
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
this meeting so as usual we will begin
 
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
our meeting by all rising and joining
 
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas as he leads
 
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:11.449 --> 00:11:11.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you everyone
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
welcome to the Thursday January of
 
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
February 16th meeting of science
 
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
technology and energy we are here this
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
morning to hear two bills House Bill 631
 
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
FN relative to electric utility smart
 
00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:29.339 align:start position:0%
meter Gateway devices
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
followed by hb159 relative to the
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
default service rate for electricity
 
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
we will then be taking a lunch break and
 
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
a caucus break
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
and will return at one o'clock for an
 
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:11:50.329 --> 00:11:50.339 align:start position:0%
at which we will pass judgment on a
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
fairly large number of bills both
 
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
scheduled today and resumed from
 
00:11:59.569 --> 00:11:59.579 align:start position:0%
earlier executive sessions
 
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll open a public hearing
 
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 631
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
and the prime sponsor representative
 
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:09.260 align:start position:0%
Christian is not here so we will ask
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
representative Corman to introduce this
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
legislation to us
 
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and again welcome
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh or hello members of the committee for
 
00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:22.519 align:start position:0%
the record I'm representative Tom Corman
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
Grafton 15 which is Lebanon ward 3 I'm
 
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
here to introduce HB 631fn
 
00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:32.579 align:start position:0%
uh we have heard many people say this is
 
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
a simple bill this is a simple bill it
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
says that electric utilities shall
 
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
provide customers with the option to
 
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:43.740 align:start position:0%
purchase a smart meter Gateway device to
 
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
be installed removed or Changed by
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
authorized utility Personnel or approved
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
contractors and Electric utilities shall
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
notify customers of this option so it is
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
not forcing any customers to have a
 
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
smart meter it just makes sure that
 
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
everybody has the option currently of
 
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
the four utilities serving the state two
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
of them make smart meters available and
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
two do not the two that do not are ever
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
source and Liberty I'm a liberty
 
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
customer and I don't have the option of
 
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
having a smart meter
 
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:22.019 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear what we're talking
 
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
about isn't just AMR meters the type
 
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
that are the drive-by reporting device
 
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the ones that are
 
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
actually two-way meters where the
 
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
information actually can go back to the
 
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
utility about things like time of use so
 
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
that time of use charging can actually
 
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
be in effect for certain customers which
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
will be even more important as EVS
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
become more dominant in the state
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
because people are going to want to be
 
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
able to charge their EVS at times with
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
lower rates typically overnight
 
00:13:59.930 --> 00:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.269 align:start position:0%
um and
um

00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
again we're not talking about anybody
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
being forced to do anything any
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
customers being forced to do anything
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
we're just saying that that the
 
00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:12.779 align:start position:0%
utilities need to make this option
 
00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:15.530 align:start position:0%
utilities need to make this option
available

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.250 align:start position:0%
available
um

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
there's really not much else I can say
 
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
about it uh
 
00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Representative Christian
 
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:35.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
um so is there any uh expectation on
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
whether the cost of the meter would be
 
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
added to the customer's bill or uh
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in the overall cost of
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
elect electric just electric electricity
 
00:14:53.449 --> 00:14:53.459 align:start position:0%
distribution across the utility
 
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bernardi my
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the customer would
 
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
pay for the meter so it wouldn't be
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
charged to other people if I want a
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
smart meter I pay for it it's about two
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars to have a smart meter so
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
via at my option that's my understanding
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
of how it works thank you very much
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
Tom uh as far as you understand does the
 
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:26.420 align:start position:0%
does the bill pretty much leave the
 
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
specification decide who decides
 
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.430 align:start position:0%
specification decide who decides
um

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
which piece of equipment
 
00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.189 align:start position:0%
which piece of equipment
um

00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
the customer would get is that basically
 
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
all in the hands of the utility to sort
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
of do the research and figure out which
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
which meter they want to have customers
 
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.550 align:start position:0%
which meter they want to have customers
own

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that from the
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
text of the bill it does not specify any
 
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
particular type of meter it just says
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
smart meter Gateway device so that I
 
00:15:59.689 --> 00:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
would imagine the utility can decide
 
00:16:02.689 --> 00:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
what type to offer
 
00:16:02.699 --> 00:16:05.569 align:start position:0%
what type to offer
thanks

00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to that question
 
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
does the customer get to choose what
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
kind of meter he wants
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
does he get to specify to the utility oh
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
I want XYZ meter instead of ABC meter
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
so that I do not know uh I would imagine
 
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
that each utility can support some range
 
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
of meters some set of meters it might be
 
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
one type might be a few types
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh I would imagine then that the utility
 
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
would make available to the customer you
 
00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339 align:start position:0%
know here here are the types of meters
 
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
that we can support and then the
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
customer can choose because it would
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
certainly make sense that
 
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
it has to be something that the utility
 
00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:52.139 align:start position:0%
can interact with right I mean if we're
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
talking about something where you know
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
the information has to get back to the
 
00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.410 align:start position:0%
the information has to get back to the
utility

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
utility
 
00:16:59.329 --> 00:16:59.339 align:start position:0%
the utility has to be able to field that
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
information so I would imagine that
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
there's some set of approved meters
 
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
we have someone signed up from
 
00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
eversource to testify so we can ask that
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
question there
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
any further questions thank you
 
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
representative Corman for stepping up
 
00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:17.579 align:start position:0%
and pinch hitting for representative
 
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
Christian we appreciate it thank you
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:23.579 align:start position:0%
please do a pink card just for the
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
record thank you next we'll call on Mr
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
Michael Licata from eversource to give
 
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
us the utilities perspective on this
 
00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.049 align:start position:0%
us the utilities perspective on this
legislation

00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.059 --> 00:17:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
um Michael Licata representing
 
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
eversource energy I appreciate the
 
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify before you today
 
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
on this legislation
 
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.710 align:start position:0%
on this legislation
um

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
I am registering our opposition to the
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
bill uh that said we are uh you know
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
very supportive of uh customers ability
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
to access
 
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.169 align:start position:0%
to access
um

00:18:11.169 --> 00:18:11.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
more detailed pricing excuse me more
 
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
detailed usage information and the
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
expansion of
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
smart meters in the state of New
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we definitely appreciate the
 
00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:27.299 align:start position:0%
the Bill's sponsors intent
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
um but I'll sort of lay out our our
 
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill as written first
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
and foremost the bill directs the
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
utility to provide upon customer Quest
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
smart Gateway devices smart Gateway
 
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
devices are actually different than Ami
 
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
or smart meters a smart Gateway device
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
is a device that allows and enables load
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
control behind the meter so think of a
 
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
demand response program where the
 
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
utility has the ability to reduce your
 
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh uh thermostat or control your water
 
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
heater at times of peak use so they are
 
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:10.340 align:start position:0%
two separate
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
types of of infrastructure the Gateway
 
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
device versus a smart meter which
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
um as was described allows for more
 
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.270 align:start position:0%
um as was described allows for more
granular

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
granular
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
information on time of use
 
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
so the intent of the bill though which
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to is to allow for a customer
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
to request a smart meter an Ami meter as
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
two of the other utilities have and just
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
by way of background as part of
 
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
eversource most recent Ray case we did
 
00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
agree as part of the settlement with
 
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
parties including the Office of Consumer
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
Advocate who advocated for this
 
00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
to conduct a study a feasibility study
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the the cost of implementing
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
and swapping out our current AMR meters
 
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
with AMI meters we are in the process of
 
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
selecting a vendor to conduct that study
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
we have issued an RFP and we are
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
receiving those responses back now our
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
expectation is that we'll be selecting a
 
00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:24.419 align:start position:0%
vendor next month and that will take
 
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
maybe three to four months to conduct
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
that feasibility study that we'll look
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
at the costs and impacts of of changing
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
our meters uh out so that process is in
 
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
place as well or moving forward I should
 
00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:42.059 align:start position:0%
say as well and really the the Crux of
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
the issue for for us is um
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's not just the meter in
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
order to enable either a smart Gateway
 
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
devices functionality or an Ami meters
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
functionality there are systems that the
 
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
utility has that need to be to enable
 
00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:06.059 align:start position:0%
that functionality so right now our
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
current systems don't have the ability
 
00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
to to enable that functionality and so
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
we would need to and this will be part
 
00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:15.299 align:start position:0%
of of the review uh need to change our
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
meter management system we would need to
 
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
change our customer information system
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
and potentially billing systems so it is
 
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
more involved than simply changing out a
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
meter and then the customer being able
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
to to access that that information that
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
said again I I very much appreciate the
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor's intent
 
00:21:39.409 --> 00:21:39.419 align:start position:0%
um we are moving forward on a number of
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
um areas to address this concern to have
 
00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
have Smart metering or or more granular
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
metering available so with that I'll be
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that the
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
committee may have
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr locata representative Doug
 
00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question
 
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh to clarify your
 
00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:06.539 align:start position:0%
last statement
 
00:22:09.409 --> 00:22:09.419 align:start position:0%
did you mean to imply that if you need
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
to do all these systems I assume there
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
would be upgrades and things like that
 
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.470 align:start position:0%
would be upgrades and things like that
would

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
the cost of that be included in your
 
00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:22.340 align:start position:0%
next rate height consideration
 
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
whenever we
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
change those systems out the costs
 
00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:30.419 align:start position:0%
associated with that would be included
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
in in our next radius I don't know if it
 
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
would be the next one or the one after
 
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
that their significant undertakings uh
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot to consider as part of
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
of replacement of those systems you
 
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
obviously want the customer to
 
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
experience a seamless transition and
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
there's many utilities across the
 
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
country that have had challenges they're
 
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
very complicated systems
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you Miss Champion for
 
00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
the follow-up
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
so in other words if say um
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
one percent or even five percent of your
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
customers wanted the new meter
 
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.310 align:start position:0%
customers wanted the new meter
um

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
even though they they may have to pay
 
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
individually for that meter everybody in
 
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
your in your area would be settled with
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
the expense of upgrading the system to
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
provide that functionality
 
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
um that's a fair question
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how we would interpret
 
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill if we simply
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
need to provide the meter so that way
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
the customer would I'm sorry the smart
 
00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
Gateway device or if it were amended the
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
the meter so that way the customer would
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
be sort of ready
 
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
um the first one in line so to speak
 
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
when uh those systems were changed out
 
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
or if this I
 
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
or if this would require us to to do
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
those system upgrades it's I I don't
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
think it's clear by the legislation
 
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
so for clarity for clarification as a
 
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.870 align:start position:0%
so for clarity for clarification as a
follow-up

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
you mentioned an RFP to
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
conduct a study cost study on all of
 
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
this upgrades meters plus back room
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
system upgrades
 
00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:21.539 align:start position:0%
I assume the study would include those
 
00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
back room upgrades correct I I want to
 
00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:27.299 align:start position:0%
double check that I know the study is
 
00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:30.299 align:start position:0%
looking at the meters themselves I I
 
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
would be happy to get back to the
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee to to make sure I'm giving you
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
an accurate answer on that
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Bernardi
 
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
so uh just to be clear your study is
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
looking at uh meters and potentially the
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
back room systems but not Gateway
 
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
devices as this bill is discussing
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.350 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:06.409 --> 00:25:06.419 align:start position:0%
eversource is a very large utility
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
of course also in in Connecticut and in
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh Mr Lakota can you tell
 
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.029 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh Mr Lakota can you tell
us

00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
to what extent
 
00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.750 align:start position:0%
to what extent
um

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:21.289 --> 00:25:21.299 align:start position:0%
smart metering time of use rates things
 
00:25:24.769 --> 00:25:24.779 align:start position:0%
like that are already in place in
 
00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and Massachusetts
 
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
is eversource doing this elsewhere
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's sure
 
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
um we in Massachusetts uh in November of
 
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
last year received approval from the
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
regulator to to do this change to go
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
from AMR meters to Ami meters so that
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
process has has begun there is a
 
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group that that order
 
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start position:0%
requires us to to create and advise with
 
00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
that stakeholder group is supposed to
 
00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
issue a report on essentially the
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
rollout plan of those meter swaps uh by
 
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
I believe it's August of next year so
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
correct 2024 so that process is is
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing I would in terms of the actual
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
meter swaps themselves all of those sort
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
of back office systems again need to be
 
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.350 align:start position:0%
of back office systems again need to be
changed

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
and that process is is moving forward
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
now now in Massachusetts I need to check
 
00:26:32.649 --> 00:26:32.659 align:start position:0%
in on Connecticut but I think they are
 
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
behind Massachusetts as is New Hampshire
 
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
from uh uh you know moving forward
 
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
standpoint so uh that process we just
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
again just got approval for uh the
 
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
change in Massachusetts to go to Ami and
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
it's moving forward now
 
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.110 align:start position:0%
follow up
if

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
I mean our bill here says a smart meter
 
00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
Gateway device so from what you've said
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm interpreting that you feel like
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:06.419 align:start position:0%
an exact kind of a mashup of two
 
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
is there a risk well it's not a risk for
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
us because we're not going there but
 
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.269 align:start position:0%
us because we're not going there but
um

00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
is there an opportunity
 
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the study uh came out of
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
the rate case you're putting out an RFP
 
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
to look at the possibility of going to
 
00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:34.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
by the time we get to implementing Ami
 
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
the state of the art Maybe
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
Gateway devices that allow actually
 
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.130 align:start position:0%
Gateway devices that allow actually
allow

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
the utility to see and perhaps control
 
00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
within customers territory you know load
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
and is there a question here yeah I
 
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
guess I'm I I guess my question would be
 
00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
is eversource looking at the quickly
 
00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:06.059 align:start position:0%
evolving technology in the utility space
 
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
and thinking about a way to perhaps
 
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.630 align:start position:0%
and thinking about a way to perhaps
LeapFrog

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
LeapFrog
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
another metering technology to actually
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
more quickly get to the what what is
 
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
Promised by new technology which is
 
00:28:21.409 --> 00:28:21.419 align:start position:0%
active load management and transactive
 
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
energy sure
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
um sorry thank you Mr
 
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.570 align:start position:0%
um sorry thank you Mr
so

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
the term smart meter Gateway device is
 
00:28:33.289 --> 00:28:33.299 align:start position:0%
defined in statute and requires uh
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
customer consent in order for the
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
utility to install the device and for
 
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
those members of the committee who have
 
00:28:42.529 --> 00:28:42.539 align:start position:0%
been around a while will recall many
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
discussions and passionate discussions
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
on the part of some members of the
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
public around that and concerns with
 
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
with health effects of of meter
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
Communications so they are two different
 
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
things but the the question you're
 
00:29:03.769 --> 00:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
asking is you know should
 
00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:06.419 align:start position:0%
for load control be looking further out
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
and and I the answer to that is yes and
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:11.330 align:start position:0%
I think
um

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing and what we're
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
implementing is sort of a future where
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
there isn't a smart meter Gateway device
 
00:29:21.769 --> 00:29:21.779 align:start position:0%
to do load control we have a pilot
 
00:29:24.889 --> 00:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
program right now uh pilot demand
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
response program that on the residential
 
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
side it's a voluntary program that
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
allows us to at the customer's consent
 
00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
control their Wi-Fi enabled thermostat
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
and it's a third party that that does
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
that there's no device that we're
 
00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
installing at the home there's the Wi-Fi
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
thermostat that the customer installs
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
and then a third party does that control
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
at customer consent and so I think
 
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.149 align:start position:0%
at customer consent and so I think
that's

00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
how things are evolving that there's not
 
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
a Communications device that is wired
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
into your house it is you know as they
 
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
say I guess less popular phase phrase
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
now but the internet of things where uh
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's Cloud management of devices
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
whether it's uh uh you know again a
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
water heater a furnace or potentially
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
another Appliance or in in the future uh
 
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:24.539 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's safe to assume that
 
00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
eversource and most utilities are not
 
00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:33.299 align:start position:0%
adjusting time accounting inventory
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
system any idea what the inventory cost
 
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
would be to have these on stock in stock
 
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
and how much the inventory of volume
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
would need to be and would that cost be
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
passed to the rate payers
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't know the answers to most of
 
00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
those questions so
 
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
um I I think as envisioned by the bill
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
that the and as uh was testified to the
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
individual customer requesting the smart
 
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
Gateway device would be responsible for
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
for the cost of that
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
what that would be I I you know we would
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
obviously have to do quite a bit of work
 
00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
to to figure that out you know what
 
00:31:12.649 --> 00:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
vendor what device
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative munz asked a question
 
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
for coming in here I have a two-part
 
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.730 align:start position:0%
for coming in here I have a two-part
question

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
um the back the back office uh back room
 
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
systems that you spoke of that you know
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
control the meters and customer service
 
00:31:36.529 --> 00:31:36.539 align:start position:0%
and billing
 
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
um are those consistent across your
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
areas of operation in other words is the
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
system you use in Massachusetts the same
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
as you use in New Hampshire
 
00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:48.179 align:start position:0%
and if so
 
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the changes that you're you're
 
00:31:54.889 --> 00:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
now making to respond to the the
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
um decision of the the regulator in
 
00:31:59.690 --> 00:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts wouldn't that also benefit
 
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
you in New Hampshire and minimize the
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
cost to implement it here
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
so they are different systems across
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
each jurisdiction I believe in some
 
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
states even
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
across different areas of the state
 
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:16.220 align:start position:0%
there are different systems the company
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
I believe are long-term goal would be to
 
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
have a standardization across all of our
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
service territories and to answer the
 
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
second question certainly the work
 
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
that's being done in Massachusetts
 
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
at that future date could be leveraged
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
to to help make it a more efficient
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
conversion to a standardized system uh
 
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:43.100 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419 align:start position:0%
Noel has a question
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I I take it from
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
your presentation that your opposition
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
is based on the amount of time that this
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
bill allows you to perform what you're
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
describing is is system analysis or
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
duties to be able to put this in place
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
if we expanded the time the bill allows
 
00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
for this to be implemented uh say to six
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
months or maybe a year would that
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
remove your opposition or would that be
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
more acceptable yeah so our our
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill really stems from
 
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
whether it's a smart Gateway device or a
 
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
smart Ami meter
 
00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:26.630 align:start position:0%
smart Ami meter
um

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:29.889 --> 00:33:29.899 align:start position:0%
the customer who is is requesting that
 
00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:33.779 align:start position:0%
wants functionality from that device you
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
know I don't think they just want the
 
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
device for the sake of the device and
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
that is a much that is a significant and
 
00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:46.019 align:start position:0%
complicated question that involves cost
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and what we're suggesting is that
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
there are studies underway for
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
components of that at the very least and
 
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
you know as I discussed sort of the
 
00:34:00.169 --> 00:34:00.179 align:start position:0%
multi-year rollout in Massachusetts
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
um you know I there's a lot to consider
 
00:34:06.529 --> 00:34:06.539 align:start position:0%
uh not just sort of placing the meter on
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
the side of a business or home uh
 
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
involved so it
 
00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
I think there's there's more to consider
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chair
 
00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:22.619 align:start position:0%
does your work or your analysis work in
 
00:34:22.619 --> 00:34:24.230 align:start position:0%
does your work or your analysis work in
Massachusetts

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
help you expedite the rollout the
 
00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
potential roll out of such devices here
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
yeah as as I uh responded to
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
representative munz I I think the work
 
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
that we are doing in Massachusetts while
 
00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
you know it's not one for one New
 
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has has its own
 
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
um you know unique uh characteristics
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
that work will help uh you know we'll
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
have lessons learned what went right
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
what went wrong how can we do this
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
better uh faster more efficiently so so
 
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
that work you know I believe will help
 
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
inform our future work at some point in
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative has a question thank you
 
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
question the Ami meters you mentioned
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
are those do those support time of use
 
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh Ami meters can support time of use
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
rates AMR meters can support time of use
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
representative munz has another question
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair what just follow up
 
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:28.849 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair what just follow up
on

00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
um what on the question from from
 
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
representative Noel
 
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
um and um I'll preface it by saying I'm
 
00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:38.579 align:start position:0%
I'm acutely aware of what happens when
 
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
you assume
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
um but assuming that um
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know upgrading to these these smart
 
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.930 align:start position:0%
you know upgrading to these these smart
meters

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
meters
 
00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:50.660 align:start position:0%
is going to be it would be beneficial to
 
00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
eversource as well as beneficial to the
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
um consumers is there anything that we
 
00:35:59.569 --> 00:35:59.579 align:start position:0%
can do and to make this bill
 
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
more attractive to you to make it more
 
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
of a positive incentive to kind of move
 
00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.089 --> 00:36:14.099 align:start position:0%
I I think that's a fair question
 
00:36:14.099 --> 00:36:14.690 align:start position:0%
I I think that's a fair question
um

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
I would like to have time to consider
 
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.829 align:start position:0%
I would like to have time to consider
what

00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
policy objectives could be placed into
 
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
statute that would help facilitate sort
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
of a future conversion so be happy to to
 
00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:29.579 align:start position:0%
get back to you with some thoughts on
 
00:36:29.579 --> 00:36:31.930 align:start position:0%
get back to you with some thoughts on
that

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:31.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh so I I just heard
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
you say that AMR and Ami meters can do
 
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
time of use uh
 
00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.089 align:start position:0%
time of use uh
so

00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:47.099 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
you have AMR meters if the goal is time
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
of use for charging EVS
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
do we even need to make the change
 
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
um it's so the Ami meter uh and and I
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I'm
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
accurately capturing this so
 
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.470 align:start position:0%
accurately capturing this so
um

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:11.339 align:start position:0%
I might wanna
 
00:37:13.609 --> 00:37:13.619 align:start position:0%
phone a friend and and get back to the
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
committee on this
 
00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:17.540 align:start position:0%
um but but it's really the the
 
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
granularity of the information that the
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
meter allows for
 
00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
um and the sophistication of the meter
 
00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:26.900 align:start position:0%
so uh you know if we're talking about
 
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
on Peak off peak sort of you know to to
 
00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:34.810 align:start position:0%
on Peak off peak sort of you know to to
um

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:34.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh two types of rate or you know an
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
hourly rate which is often talked about
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
with transactive energy so it really
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
depends on the granularity of the
 
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
information but I I guess I would uh
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
asked to to check to make sure uh I'm
 
00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
I'm accurately capturing that
 
00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:01.619 align:start position:0%
so I would appreciate then if you could
 
00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
make that
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh assessment and send that information
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
back to the committee yes
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a question
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
yes they can share it folks I think it's
 
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
very exciting I'll put out RFP for our
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
study and I hope it's a cost benefit
 
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
study as well looking at such things as
 
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh flattening the demand curve and
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
transactional energy
 
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
um now he said that in Massachusetts and
 
00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
in Connecticut you're already moving
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
down further down the road of
 
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.069 align:start position:0%
down further down the road of
incorporating

00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
incorporating
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
I'll call it smart technology upgrading
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
the grid
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
um if they manage to lower their Peak
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
that will result in lower demand for
 
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
those two states well New Hampshire
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
benefit from a lower demand from their
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear we received approval
 
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts in November to move
 
00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
forward with with the conversion
 
00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:04.490 align:start position:0%
forward with with the conversion
um

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
the meters in and of themselves don't
 
00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
reduce Peak it's it's the programming uh
 
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
behind them
 
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
you know the incentives that that get
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
offered to customers
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
um and so certainly anything that any
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
state in the region does to reduce their
 
00:39:31.849 --> 00:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
usage during times of Peak load benefits
 
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
all as you've heard from from the iso if
 
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
we you know the system is very much
 
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
designed from a capacity energy and
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
transmission standpoint to to meet the
 
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
peak you know hour of the peak day of
 
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
the peak month of the peak year and so
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
um if the the system is designed and the
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
costs are built in to to meet that Peak
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
then reducing
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
um reducing that benefits all
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
um now some companies have uh in in some
 
00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
states have looked to try to reduce
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
their transmission charges which are
 
00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
their share of charges during that that
 
00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
Peak they would would have specific
 
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
customer benefits associated with that
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
that would not necessarily flow to to
 
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.050 align:start position:0%
that would not necessarily flow to to
all

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
follow up one more quasi yeah sort of a
 
00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.870 align:start position:0%
follow up one more quasi yeah sort of a
follow-up

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
um will you be employing the least cost
 
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
integrated resource plan and is that
 
00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:32.579 align:start position:0%
something is this a place where we where
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's appropriate to employ
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
employ that if it were functioning to
 
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
the top of its ability yeah uh
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
the transition to uh an Ami meter
 
00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
um would be part of a lease cost
 
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
planning proceeding that would be a
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
significant uh investment with you know
 
00:40:59.450 --> 00:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
lots of of costs and benefits to uh to
 
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
consider and that would be be a part of
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
the the utilities long-term planning
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
representative closure has a question
 
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair thank you Mr Lakota
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question what I'm looking at
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
is this is an opt-in plan
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
is eversource now putting Gateway or
 
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
smart meters out on customers
 
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
that do not have an input on it do they
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
ask oh no uh we we do not so uh per
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
state statute
 
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
um we do not would not install a smart
 
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
Gateway device without customer consent
 
00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:44.339 align:start position:0%
uh and as I said we don't have a program
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
um right now that that would require
 
00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
that we do have a voluntary program
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
where customers can can enroll and
 
00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:55.619 align:start position:0%
produce their their uh thermostat
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.599 --> 00:42:02.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions from the
 
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
committee I want to thank you Mr locata
 
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
and I will call on the
 
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
last pink card that I have before me and
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
ask that Susan Durling from Hillsborough
 
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
come up front and give us your
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
perspective on this bill Ms darling
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:44.660 align:start position:0%
press the button please
 
00:42:47.329 --> 00:42:47.339 align:start position:0%
excellent good morning chairman those
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name is
 
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
Susan darling I live in Hillsboro and
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of the town's energy
 
00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.609 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of the town's energy
Commission

00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
and we have recently been looking into
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
uh Community power as a way to give our
 
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
residents more control over costs and
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy choices one of our
 
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
conversations about Community power
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
got into time of use
 
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that would
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
require Smart Meters the other choices
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
are fairly easy offering people rates
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
and sustainability levels
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
why would anyone want to use time of use
 
00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.170 align:start position:0%
why would anyone want to use time of use
pricing

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
pricing
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
well one of the reasons might be that
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
the grid needs it
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
we all have heard that our electric grid
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
needs Improvement to manage future needs
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
and pricing that changes according to
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
the time of day can reduce strain on the
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
electrical grid by motivating people to
 
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
shifting their usage to off-peak hours
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
and this would also save money for
 
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
utilities because fuel prices will be
 
00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:53.420 align:start position:0%
lower during those hours
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
I'm also the proud owner of a used
 
00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle this year and I would
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
very much be interested in being able to
 
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
charge it during off-peak hours
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
time of use pricing also reduces the
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
need for expensive Peak power plants we
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
pay a lot of money to these power plants
 
00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:14.099 align:start position:0%
to just sit there idly most of the time
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
and when we encourage people to shift
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
their uses to off-peak hours
 
00:44:20.089 --> 00:44:20.099 align:start position:0%
we can reduce the need for these money
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
hungry plants the bow plant is costing
 
00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
us ISO New England customers almost 20
 
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
million just this year just to sit there
 
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
most of the time and be ready
 
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.270 align:start position:0%
most of the time and be ready
and

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.250 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
as an aside coal is a really tough
 
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
fuel to use for Peak it takes a long
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
time to warm up and get ready and work
 
00:44:43.079 --> 00:44:44.569 align:start position:0%
time to warm up and get ready and work
well

00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:44.579 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:47.099 align:start position:0%
time of use pricing can also help with
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
integrating renewable energy sources
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
into the grid since the sun isn't always
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
shining in the wind isn't always blowing
 
00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
shifting uses to off-peak hours can
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
reduce the need from other sources that
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
are more expensive
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
Smart Meters can also release us from
 
00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
bondage to one electric company
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sure some of us remember the time
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
when you had to use One telephone system
 
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
and to buy your equipment from one
 
00:45:14.089 --> 00:45:14.099 align:start position:0%
company and when you want to call your
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
sister in the next town it was a toll
 
00:45:17.329 --> 00:45:17.339 align:start position:0%
call none of us would like to go back to
 
00:45:17.339 --> 00:45:18.349 align:start position:0%
call none of us would like to go back to
that

00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
we got our service from one company that
 
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
had complete control and electric meters
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
are now tied to the company we get our
 
00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
service from in a similar way there is
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
no reason we need to continue that we
 
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
should be able to give consumers the
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
choice that smart meters would give
 
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
and I think it is in the interest of
 
00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
eversource to drag this out and make it
 
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:41.630 align:start position:0%
eversource to drag this out and make it
as

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.290 align:start position:0%
as
um

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
a long implementation process as
 
00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
possible because if that happened they
 
00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
would be forced to be more competitive
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
and their rates might go down
 
00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
getting a smart meter is a choice an
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
informed choice for the consumers of New
 
00:45:59.390 --> 00:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we can choose to approve the
 
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
efficiency of our furnaces balancing
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
costs and benefits and consumers of
 
00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:05.339 align:start position:0%
electricity should be able to make the
 
00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:07.619 align:start position:0%
same choices if they want to buy a smart
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
meter because they figured out they're
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
going to save money they should be able
 
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
Smart Meters give consumers more freedom
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
to control use and costs Smart Meters
 
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
can reduce energy costs
 
00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
result in a more sustainable power grid
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
and help manage energy demand they are a
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
technology we should definitely be
 
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of thank you
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Ms darling for
 
00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:35.099 align:start position:0%
taking the trouble to come in and talk
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
to us today we appreciate getting your
 
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
perspective just for clarity is your
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
perspective because you wrote on your
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
pink card that you were representing
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
yourself is your perspective just your
 
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
own or is that the perspective of the
 
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough energy committee as well I
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
um decided on the spur of the moment
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
last night to come in today so I did not
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
discuss my testimony with the committee
 
00:46:59.930 --> 00:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
so I don't feel comfortable saying I
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
represent them
 
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
great thanks for clarifying that
 
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
questions for Ms Durling representative
 
00:47:08.809 --> 00:47:08.819 align:start position:0%
munz has a question thank you Mr
 
00:47:11.569 --> 00:47:11.579 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for coming in and um
 
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
want to try to leverage your expertise
 
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
as a member of a local energy committee
 
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
I must I'm assuming that
 
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.990 align:start position:0%
I must I'm assuming that
um

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
you you and your committee have
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
determined that the meters that are in
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
place in Hillsboro won't Supply
 
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:33.260 align:start position:0%
I won't um support time of use
 
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
rates we do not have information
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
currently on the meters that exist in
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
the community but from
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
um General
 
00:47:46.609 --> 00:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
kind of community knowledge I don't
 
00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
think most of the community has a smart
 
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:56.569 --> 00:47:56.579 align:start position:0%
do you know if you're if the rates in
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
your town or AMR or Ami
 
00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.910 align:start position:0%
your town or AMR or Ami
meters

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
meters
 
00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:05.579 align:start position:0%
do I know if our meters are AMR or Ami
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:14.329 --> 00:48:14.339 align:start position:0%
could you refresh our memory which
 
00:48:17.089 --> 00:48:17.099 align:start position:0%
utility serves Hillsboro eversource
 
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.569 --> 00:48:23.579 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions I want to thank
 
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
you for once again for coming in and
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
since I have no more pink cards on this
 
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh Bill HB 631fn I'll ask if there is
 
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the room who would like
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
to say something about this bill before
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask representative
 
00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
closure to give us a
 
00:48:53.089 --> 00:48:53.099 align:start position:0%
a sense of what the blue sheet says
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
00:48:58.210 --> 00:48:58.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
hb631 blue sheet had one in support
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
another pose on line 12 inch support to
 
00:49:07.609 --> 00:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
a pose thank you
 
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that we'll close the
 
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 631 FN and
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
we'll take a bio break until 10 o'clock
 
00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
at which time we will hear House Bill
 
01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:34.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
okay ladies and gentlemen time to get
 
01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
I would like to open a public hearing on
 
01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
House Bill 159 and call to the front of
 
01:03:50.089 --> 01:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
the room the prime sponsor of the bill
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
just to let every know everyone know I
 
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.990 align:start position:0%
just to let every know everyone know I
have

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:04:08.089 --> 01:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.099 --> 01:04:10.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:13.609 --> 01:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
I currently have 10 pink cards
 
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
of people who want to testify on this
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
bill so
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
we may be
 
01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
well maybe 11. and that's including the
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor thank you Rebecca so we
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
may be limiting testimony to no more
 
01:04:32.089 --> 01:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
than three minutes on this bill
 
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
however the prime sponsor will have
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
a good five minutes to introduce the
 
01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.710 align:start position:0%
a good five minutes to introduce the
bill

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Rebecca
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Vos
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative Rebecca McWilliams I
 
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
represent South Concord it's a pleasure
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
to be here with you today
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
um by way of background I think we all
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
know that New Hampshire is facing a
 
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
energy crisis in terms of the
 
01:05:02.829 --> 01:05:02.839 align:start position:0%
electricity rates that we have seen
 
01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
spiking this winter
 
01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:06.410 align:start position:0%
spiking this winter
um

01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
for a quality solid energy policy to
 
01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:11.579 align:start position:0%
work in the state we need to have
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
consistent energy rates both for
 
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
businesses and for our own pocketbooks
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
as residential customers
 
01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
and right now what we're seeing is crazy
 
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
volatility the inability to predict and
 
01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
budget for uh doubling of electric rates
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
and so this is a concern I'm sure this
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
is a concern for everyone on this
 
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
committee and your constituents
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
therefore the intent of this bill House
 
01:05:41.089 --> 01:05:41.099 align:start position:0%
Bill 159 is to come up with a way to
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
address spikes and volatility in the
 
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
electricity Arena
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
obviously this is a bill that's a first
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
pass and I believe that there's a lot of
 
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:55.140 align:start position:0%
opportunity for um
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
for for changing the way that we address
 
01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
pricing and the way that the spikes
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
impact individuals and businesses here
 
01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
so the goal here of course is to create
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
some kind of a gradual curve up and down
 
01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
rather than crazy Spike and extreme
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
rates for our rate payers
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of background and
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative Corman would you mind
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
passing around those those amendments
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
that you picked up
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
um by way of background we know that
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
eversource currently goes out to bid
 
01:06:33.529 --> 01:06:33.539 align:start position:0%
every six months to get new uh new
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
pricing information and figure out how
 
01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:38.420 align:start position:0%
much electricity rates are going to be
 
01:06:41.809 --> 01:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
that in a market where we are looking at
 
01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
changes daily
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
um certainly monthly with the cost of
 
01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
natural gas being impacted by
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
International markets and and the
 
01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
conflict in Ukraine we know that that
 
01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
type of bidding every six months really
 
01:06:59.210 --> 01:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
leaves us with a very conservative cost
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
because it's hard to predict exactly
 
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen over the next
 
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
months and so therefore the idea here is
 
01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:09.059 align:start position:0%
to come up with a mechanism and a way
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
that the pricing can be set on a shorter
 
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:15.059 align:start position:0%
basis and therefore more responsive to
 
01:07:17.569 --> 01:07:17.579 align:start position:0%
Market rates and not locked in at a
 
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
six-month conservative with some fluff
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
built in price because of course the
 
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
businesses and consumers have to pay for
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
that conservative estimate so if you
 
01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
look to the language on the bill as
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
introduced HP 159 what I did was I set a
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
five-year average of the retail rates
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
from ISO New England and I'm trying to
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
lock in rates in order to keep it more
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
along the line of a curve rather than
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
allowing a spike I've heard all kinds of
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
great feedback from different members of
 
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
the energy community in regards to how
 
01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:52.220 align:start position:0%
this probably wouldn't work
 
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
there may be some concerns about
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
putting the potential risk on the
 
01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
utilities which they're not really in a
 
01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
position to to manage that level of risk
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
and I acknowledge that but also our
 
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
consumers are not really in a position
 
01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:11.579 align:start position:0%
to manage this kind of risk and so we
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
have this Balancing Act between
 
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
consumers and the uh
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
the energy producers providers and
 
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
utilities so so really the goal here is
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
to come up with something as a committee
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
that could potentially address the
 
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
spikes and even out the curves so that
 
01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
people are not stuck with crazy rates
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
when things like the conflict in Ukraine
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
happen having some kind of a buffer to
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
protect us
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
so as I said um representative Corman
 
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:43.980 align:start position:0%
did a great job passing out the
 
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
potential Amendment
 
01:08:48.769 --> 01:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
um and I'd like to just address very
 
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
simply the language and the amendment is
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
enabling what's called laddering
 
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
laddering allows a utility to go out to
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
bid multiple times a year instead of
 
01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
once every six months to get better
 
01:09:04.249 --> 01:09:04.259 align:start position:0%
pricing this is enabled following the
 
01:09:06.169 --> 01:09:06.179 align:start position:0%
Connecticut model ever source does this
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
in Connecticut right now and they have
 
01:09:11.329 --> 01:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
developed having an individual role as
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
part of the Department of energy this
 
01:09:16.729 --> 01:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
person is responsible for figuring out
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%
what the appropriate timing is and how
 
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
how frequently utilities should be
 
01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
getting their rates I think that in this
 
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
day and age in a modern time it's looked
 
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
it's time to look to modernizing both
 
01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:32.219 align:start position:0%
time abuse rates and how frequently
 
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
utilities go out to bid instead of
 
01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
locking in a six-month buffer and so as
 
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
I said this is really meant this Bill
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 159 is really meant to be a
 
01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
solution right now to the the energy
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
crisis that we are facing as a state
 
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
coming up with Innovative and Creative
 
01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
Solutions to address the pain that all
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
of our constituents businesses and
 
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
consumers are feeling right now so I'm
 
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions on this and I'm
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to amend or do a
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this bill I think that
 
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
this is a pressing issue and it's
 
01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
something that we as a committee can
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
make a difference on thank you
 
01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McWilliams for
 
01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
introducing House Bill 159 you are
 
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
uniquely positioned as someone who has
 
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
legal training
 
01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
to answer the question of whether the
 
01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced would be
 
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
constitutional constitutional or not do
 
01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
you have an opinion about that I think
 
01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
there's a constitutional question Mr
 
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
chair okay great thank you
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams seeing none
 
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move on because we have a
 
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
lot of pink cards to get through in the
 
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
next hour or so so I'll call forward now
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
Mr Griffin Roberge from the Department
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
of energy to give us the Department's
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:57.050 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh members of the
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Griffin Roberts
 
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:04.990 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Department of
energy

01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
the department is opposed to House Bill
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
159 as introduced um I will thank you
 
01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
um I will note um I did have a com a
 
01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
short conversation with representative
 
01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
McWilliams last night to understand the
 
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
intent of her language which was
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
reiterated in her public testimony and
 
01:11:24.169 --> 01:11:24.179 align:start position:0%
were certainly respectful of that um I
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to digest Amendment
 
01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
0-557h so my comments will just be
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
focused on the bill as introduced if I
 
01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
may interrupt you briefly we are not
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to consider amendments in public
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
hearings so just confine your remarks to
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
the bill as introduced that's my
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
attention yep I can do that
 
01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
um so to open up to provide context New
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's electric distribution
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
utilities as part of restructuring under
 
01:11:54.050 --> 01:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
RSA 374f do not own generating assets or
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
the resources to produce electric power
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
for the the energy sold to cons to
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
customers through default service
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
whichever Source unitel Liberty those
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
unit those utilities competitively
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
solicit prices from generators for
 
01:12:09.649 --> 01:12:09.659 align:start position:0%
electric power on the wholesale Market
 
01:12:11.209 --> 01:12:11.219 align:start position:0%
through a competitive solicitation
 
01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
that's typically done every six months
 
01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
um the prices reflect wholesale market
 
01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
conditions and Electric utilities do not
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
make any profit from the sale of that
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
default service power is direct
 
01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
pass-through to Consumers the New
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Utilities Commission
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
then conducts an adjudicative proceeding
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
to determine the utilities electric
 
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
rates this adjudication ensures that the
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
costs recovered by the utilities are
 
01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
prudently incurred and are just fair and
 
01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
reasonable as we mentioned on earlier
 
01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
bills this year these terms prudently
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
incurred and just fair and reasonable
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
are important as they have significant
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
legal implications built upon many years
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
of legal precedent what's important to
 
01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
note is that the cost for default Energy
 
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
service again the cost of the power
 
01:12:57.530 --> 01:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
procured by these utilities are directly
 
01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
passed through to New Hampshire's
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
electric consumers they don't make any
 
01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
rate of return on these power costs but
 
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
they make utilities make a rate of
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
return on the resources needed to
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
distribute and transmit that power to
 
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.490 align:start position:0%
distribute and transmit that power to
customers

01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:09.500 align:start position:0%
customers
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
circling back to the bill the bill seeks
 
01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
to amend RSA 374 f
 
01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
colon 3 which outlines a variety of
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
restructuring policy principles when New
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire restructured its utilities
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
again this section of statue is meant to
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
offer some legislative guiding policy
 
01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
principles rather than any type of
 
01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
mandatory requirement at least in this
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
specific language so lines three to five
 
01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
change the term should to shall
 
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
effectively requiring that default
 
01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
service utilities shall be designed to
 
01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
provide a safety net and to assure
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
universal access in system Integrity
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
while obviously default service
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
companies are legally required to
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
provide electric service to their
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
customers this change does raise some
 
01:13:58.010 --> 01:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
questions rather than being should it's
 
01:13:59.930 --> 01:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
a shell now so it's mandatory so does
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
that mean that potentially do default
 
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
service utilities provide service even
 
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
in the event of a customer who's not
 
01:14:07.090 --> 01:14:07.100 align:start position:0%
paying their bill
 
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
similar concerns are on lines four to
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
five if default service providers have
 
01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
failed default service solicitations are
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
they still getting competitive electric
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
prices if not those those providers
 
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
could potentially be violating the state
 
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
statute again the conversion of of the
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the phrase shall to should reduce his
 
01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
flexibility and then in an area of
 
01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
Statute that has policy principles and
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
makes the statute more of a requirement
 
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
and therefore more difficult to
 
01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.510 align:start position:0%
and therefore more difficult to
implement

01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
implement
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
um circling to the main thrust of the
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
bill on lines 5 to 11.
 
01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
um the bill indicates that the cost of
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
procured power shall be recovered from
 
01:14:45.610 --> 01:14:45.620 align:start position:0%
retail rate pairs based upon a rate
 
01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
calculated by using the five-year
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
average of the retail rates for the New
 
01:14:51.709 --> 01:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
England region as posted by ISO New
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
England the language then spells out how
 
01:14:56.689 --> 01:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
the average how the average is
 
01:14:59.450 --> 01:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
recalculated and then how uh the rates
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
are the but how the rates are charged to
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
rate payers and they cannot exceed a
 
01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
rolling five-year rate we want to note
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
several observations with the bill first
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
ISO New England does not post retail
 
01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
default Service rates it does calculate
 
01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
and post the locational market market
 
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
prices at various nodes throughout New
 
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
England default service prices are
 
01:15:23.209 --> 01:15:23.219 align:start position:0%
posted in the tariffs of the new New
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
England utilities that operate
 
01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
throughout the region though they do not
 
01:15:28.729 --> 01:15:28.739 align:start position:0%
all use the same language and it's not
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
always clear what is intended in those
 
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
other states utilities tariff rates
 
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
second this language overlooks the
 
01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
differences between default power and
 
01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
default service default Service rates
 
01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:45.780 align:start position:0%
are are quoted by electric suppliers and
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
they include more than just the bare
 
01:15:50.090 --> 01:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
cost of electricity such as risk
 
01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
premiums or RPS compliance costs those
 
01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
are built into default Service rates as
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
I said there are other costs that are
 
01:16:00.169 --> 01:16:00.179 align:start position:0%
not separated out during the bidding
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
process for default service power in
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
default service solicitations and then
 
01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.709 align:start position:0%
default service solicitations and then
finally

01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
while we understand the department now
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
understands the intent is to lessen
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
energy costs for ratepayers and to
 
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
introduce some laddering effect or
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
having utilities sign contracts or
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
Powers uh signing contracts for power at
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
different rates or at varying terms to
 
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
mitigate Market volatility
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
um this change could be legally
 
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
problematic the language outlines how
 
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
the price of electricity is set to be
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
charged to retail customers devoid of
 
01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
actual Market costs for example if the
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
price of electricity is actually higher
 
01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
than the five-year average that's posted
 
01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:42.179 align:start position:0%
in the bill utilities can only collect
 
01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
up to the five-year average uh price in
 
01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
such a Circumstance the bill would
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
likely be an unconstitutional taking
 
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
under the Fifth Amendment
 
01:16:53.330 --> 01:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
additionally it's not clear how any
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
overage would be paid devoid of any
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional claim
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
um doe believes utilities would be on
 
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
the hook for that overage essentially
 
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
creating some type of deferred liability
 
01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:05.219 align:start position:0%
for them and I think the prime sponsor
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
indicated that that that's likely an
 
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
issue with this bill and would maybe
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
require some further vetting conversely
 
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
what if the price of electricity is less
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
than the five-year average do rate
 
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
payers may be locked into paying higher
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
electric rates that do not reflect
 
01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
Market realities so do you kill
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
utilities keep the money to pay down any
 
01:17:27.649 --> 01:17:27.659 align:start position:0%
type of deferred liability do utilities
 
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
return any excess funds to rate payers
 
01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
if there is a return to rate payers how
 
01:17:35.209 --> 01:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
is that process conducted these are all
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh large questions with the bill as
 
01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
introduced and I understand from the
 
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
prom sponsors testimony that this is
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
kind of a first a first step into a
 
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
larger conversation the department would
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
certainly be willing to take part in
 
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
that conversation if the bill is
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
retained or goes to a subcommittee the
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
only other thing I'd want to reference
 
01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
is that by way of background the puc
 
01:17:57.649 --> 01:17:57.659 align:start position:0%
currently has an open investigatory
 
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
that is examining all the pertinent
 
01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
aspects of New Hampshire's default
 
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
service procurement that that docket
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
opened in September 2022 and it may lead
 
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
to further discussions as to how default
 
01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
service procurement may be improved in
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
the future and with that that concludes
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
my testimony and happy to answer any
 
01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.709 align:start position:0%
my testimony and happy to answer any
questions

01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
well over six minutes uh representative
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
Corman has a question
 
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
Roberts good to see you as always good
 
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
to see you uh you referred to the bill
 
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
as written as
 
01:18:41.209 --> 01:18:41.219 align:start position:0%
doing laddering
 
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
um I but it's really about a five-year
 
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
rolling average is there are you saying
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
that that's really the same as laddering
 
01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:50.219 align:start position:0%
or is there some sort of difference
 
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I I think I'd
 
01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
kind of parcel a bit and say it it looks
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
and I think the Department's perspective
 
01:18:58.370 --> 01:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
it looks like a type of laddering it's
 
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
not exactly laddering in the straight up
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
sense that you'd expect
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
um you know I think uh the LA the
 
01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
traditional laddering framework
 
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
um is meant to have utilities go out for
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
power at varying times layer their
 
01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
contracts in a way so that people aren't
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
hit with a flat cost up front as the
 
01:19:19.729 --> 01:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor indicated prevent those
 
01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
sudden spikes and everything like that
 
01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
but I would just contend that in a
 
01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
traditional laddering model while there
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
may be benefits to a lettering approach
 
01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:30.659 align:start position:0%
of say energy costs go higher there is a
 
01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
there is a negative impact if costs go
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
lower so if the market you know is
 
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
selling power at a very low price but
 
01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
your laddering mechanism is still still
 
01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
selling power to your customers at a
 
01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
higher price you're separated from
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
Market realities and consumers could be
 
01:19:47.209 --> 01:19:47.219 align:start position:0%
paying more than what the market is
 
01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:48.860 align:start position:0%
actually offering if that makes sense
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
my question uh we heard uh earlier in
 
01:19:58.729 --> 01:19:58.739 align:start position:0%
the year about how New England Co-op
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
does its pricing would their methodology
 
01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
of how they're doing their pricing meet
 
01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
the intent of what this bill is trying
 
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
to do and would that be an easier
 
01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
process to get done thank you for the
 
01:20:14.630 --> 01:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
question so potentially it could I don't
 
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
want to speak too much for the co-op and
 
01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
I didn't speak too much in depth with
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
our regulatory staff about New Hampshire
 
01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
Electric co-ops method way of doing it
 
01:20:24.649 --> 01:20:24.659 align:start position:0%
but I know that's been something that's
 
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
been discussed
 
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
um I imagine any type of approach that
 
01:20:29.689 --> 01:20:29.699 align:start position:0%
they currently have in place would
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
likely be an Avenue that is discussed in
 
01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
the IR docket that I referenced at the
 
01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:37.149 align:start position:0%
the IR docket that I referenced at the
puc

01:20:37.149 --> 01:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and just to follow
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
up on representative Thomas's question
 
01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.209 align:start position:0%
up on representative Thomas's question
there

01:20:44.209 --> 01:20:44.219 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
um would this bill if passed eliminate
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
the puc standing order that that the
 
01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
utilities could only go to market once
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
every six months it thank you for the
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
question it it it it certainly could
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
um as I'm sure this committee is aware
 
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
um you know the puc issued an order
 
01:21:03.169 --> 01:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
um dealing with Energy Efficiency
 
01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
programs and the legislature came in and
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
passed House Bill 549 to kind of correct
 
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
that that order so it is likely that the
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
passage of the bill in its current form
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
um would likely uh override some of the
 
01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
puc's abilities to
 
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh map out default service procurements
 
01:21:24.410 --> 01:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds hopefully has a
 
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
question rather than a statement thank
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.209 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
um

01:21:29.209 --> 01:21:29.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
yes Mr aburst is the depart is the
 
01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
department supportive in concept of the
 
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
idea that
 
01:21:42.490 --> 01:21:42.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents and businesses
 
01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:46.430 align:start position:0%
need to be
better

01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
insulated from the short-term ups and
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
downs of the market and would benefit
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
from more stability
 
01:21:57.410 --> 01:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
in the way
 
01:21:57.420 --> 01:21:59.870 align:start position:0%
in the way
utilities

01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
set their rates
 
01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question yes so
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
you know as we emphasize in um our
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
state's 10-year State energy strategy
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
the Departments does have a very keen
 
01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
goal of keeping an eye on electric rates
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
through the lens of the ratepayer the
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
department is an active participant in
 
01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
the IR docket that I that I previously
 
01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
mentioned providing feedback on various
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
um different proposals or ideas about
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
um about default service procurement for
 
01:22:31.970 --> 01:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
example there have been some discussions
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
about uh in the docket about a
 
01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
descending clock auction for default
 
01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
service procurement the department at
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
least in that is not recommending that
 
01:22:42.890 --> 01:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
Approach at this time just because we
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
want to internally review that approach
 
01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
and I think in that IR docket there's
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
some intention about having a
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
presentation about that type of
 
01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
procurement option so again I think a
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
lot of these questions are kind of being
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
hashed out in the IR docket that's being
 
01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
discussed thank you
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a quick question
 
01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
be very quick and probably the simplest
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
question you're going to get today what
 
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
was that IR what was that docket number
 
01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
again thank you for the question that is
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
the easiest question I hope to get today
 
01:23:14.169 --> 01:23:14.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.570 --> 01:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
-053 and uh I did send a link to that
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
late last night to representative
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
McWilliams I'm happy to share a link to
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
that uh docket with members of the
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
committee here as well
 
01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you we appreciate the uh
 
01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:29.219 align:start position:0%
Department being here to follow up
 
01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up go ahead
 
01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to let them off the hook
 
01:23:34.850 --> 01:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
that easy
 
01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:35.950 align:start position:0%
that easy
um

01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
just a quick a quick follow-up I I
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
understand that there may be some
 
01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
question as to whether the puc actually
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
has the authority through this docket to
 
01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:49.729 align:start position:0%
has the authority through this docket to
overrule

01:23:49.729 --> 01:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
overrule
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
what the current practice is can you
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
comment on that yeah sure thank you for
 
01:23:56.209 --> 01:23:56.219 align:start position:0%
the question so I'm going to ask you not
 
01:23:58.010 --> 01:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
to answer that question it's not really
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
relevant to the bill and it's an
 
01:24:02.630 --> 01:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
interesting topic but we'll let's save
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
that for another day okay okay all right
 
01:24:06.169 --> 01:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the Department's
 
01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
perspective and now would like to hear
 
01:24:11.930 --> 01:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
the perspective of eversource on this
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.679 --> 01:24:23.770 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:23.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
again Michael Licata representing
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
eversource energy I'll be brief I think
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
I put three minutes on my card I think I
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
can do it in less uh
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to be repetitive with the
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
testimony of the Department of energy
 
01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
but essentially we agree with uh their
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
read of the legislation as introduced we
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
would be opposed and it is very much the
 
01:24:50.770 --> 01:24:50.780 align:start position:0%
same concerns that we expressed on HB
 
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
633 which the committee voted 20-0 to
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
itl again for the reason that it
 
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
separates the rate that the utility is
 
01:25:03.649 --> 01:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
allowed to charge from the cost the
 
01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
utility incurs to provide service
 
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
um that said uh very much appreciate the
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill sponsor and her uh
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh you know she wants to
 
01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
to address this issue
 
01:25:20.930 --> 01:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
um and in fact I think the word she used
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
were addressed spikes and volatility
 
01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of different ways
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
as was previously discussed that the
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
utility could procure default Service uh
 
01:25:33.649 --> 01:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
right now this six month load following
 
01:25:33.659 --> 01:25:35.570 align:start position:0%
right now this six month load following
rfps

01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
rfps
 
01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
um they are designed to to essentially
 
01:25:41.689 --> 01:25:41.699 align:start position:0%
mirror Market at those exact moments in
 
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
time and the customers are sort of have
 
01:25:47.689 --> 01:25:47.699 align:start position:0%
a maximum Market exposure and if there
 
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
is volatility in the market by design
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
that is what uh the customers are seeing
 
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
certainly we use the the example of the
 
01:25:58.610 --> 01:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
rate set back in in August of last year
 
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
where the default service rate doubled
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
and that was what the market was doing
 
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
at the time and that's what customers
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
paid and so
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
um we certainly have thoughts and and
 
01:26:12.169 --> 01:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
ideas if the goal the policy goal is to
 
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
provide price stability and reduce
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
Market volatility then again there's a
 
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
very different way we could go about
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
doing this and we would welcome the
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work with the bill
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor the committee and other
 
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
stakeholders on language to address that
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
I have not seen the the amendment so I
 
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
certainly can't speak to that and with
 
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
that happy to answer any questions that
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
the committee may have
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr locata
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
I hope those assembled will follow Mr
 
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
lakota's lead by staying well within the
 
01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
time limit that he requested two minutes
 
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
five seconds well done
 
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.330 --> 01:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
we don't accept questions from the
 
01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:01.460 align:start position:0%
audience for people who are testifying
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
if you want a member of the committee to
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
ask a question you could consult with
 
01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
someone and they could ask the question
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
on your behalf
 
01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
uh all right
 
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:15.719 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions for Mr locata we'll
 
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
move along
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
and I'll next ask Mr Michael Krauss
 
01:27:23.689 --> 01:27:23.699 align:start position:0%
newly joined to the office of the
 
01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate to provide his
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
perspective on this proposed legislation
 
01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
Mr Krause welcome thank you
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
good morning as a matter a brief
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
introduction since this is my first time
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
testifying my name is Michael Krauss I'm
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
the new staff attorney at the office of
 
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate I graduated from
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
Vermont law school I have four brief
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
points to address and I do not wish to
 
01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
reiterate too many points from
 
01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
eversource or the department of energy
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
but first and foremost the OCA testifies
 
01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill the OCA shares
 
01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative mcwilliam's concern about
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
the soaring cost of default Energy
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
service and the need to re-examine how
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
default Energy Services procured however
 
01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
with the Bill's original approach
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
discussing this five-year average is
 
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
flawed because it would create
 
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
unrecoverable stranded costs or it could
 
01:28:09.169 --> 01:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
lead to deferred costs that are unfair
 
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
to Future customers
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
third and generally speaking these
 
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
questions tend to involve policy choices
 
01:28:16.729 --> 01:28:16.739 align:start position:0%
surrounding the nature of default Energy
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
Service procurement and therefore the
 
01:28:21.649 --> 01:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
ocas on the fence as a scene in the IR
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
docket 22-053 mentioned earlier about
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
who might be the best source of that
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
option whether it be the general court
 
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
depending on how prescriptive it is or
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
even discussing with the Department of
 
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
energy as some form of alternative
 
01:28:35.570 --> 01:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
service procurement manager but
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately the OCA test device and
 
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
supported this bill and shares the
 
01:28:40.970 --> 01:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
concerns of Representative Nick Williams
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time we're open to
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:59.410 --> 01:28:59.420 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions for Mr Krause
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for coming in
 
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I I didn't catch
 
01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
um your you made some comments related
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
the the open docket and could you just
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
repeat those I didn't hear them yes I'm
 
01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
happy to repeat are you able to hear me
 
01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:20.830 align:start position:0%
happy to repeat are you able to hear me
clearly

01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
01:29:24.890 --> 01:29:24.900 align:start position:0%
great uh generally speaking the issues
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
surrounding default Energy Service rates
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
and their procurement involves policy
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
questions and the OCA was mentioning
 
01:29:32.830 --> 01:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
that in IR docket
 
01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
22-053 that's the department of energy
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
brought up that's what the puc is
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
currently exploring is some of those
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and how that can actually
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
be addressed and just generally speaking
 
01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:45.300 align:start position:0%
the OCA is expressing that those policy
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
choices might be more appropriate before
 
01:29:49.610 --> 01:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
the general court or working out an
 
01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
arrangement with the Department of
 
01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
energy or other interested parties on
 
01:30:00.050 --> 01:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:02.090 --> 01:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions I want to
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and say hello
 
01:30:06.169 --> 01:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
to Don cries for us when you get back to
 
01:30:08.689 --> 01:30:08.699 align:start position:0%
the office thank you chairman
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
next up I'll call on
 
01:30:15.709 --> 01:30:15.719 align:start position:0%
van Gaudet from rumney
 
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
good morning and welcome to sdne Good
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
morning hi thank you for having me my
 
01:30:23.570 --> 01:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
name is Von Gaudet and I am fond Cadet
 
01:30:25.370 --> 01:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
I'm from Romania Hampshire I'm a member
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
of the public I just wanted to share
 
01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
that many people are are struggling and
 
01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
going through hardship to pay on their
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
energy bills and this is the highest
 
01:30:38.209 --> 01:30:38.219 align:start position:0%
single rate increase in New Hampshire
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
history and another key point is the
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
best way to lower energy demand bills is
 
01:30:47.090 --> 01:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
to not need it and to move forward to
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
renewable energy sources that will help
 
01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
people save money such as energy saving
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
Investments such as offshore wind
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
potential to look into in solar energy
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
and these resources are boundless in in
 
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
their green resources that will help
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
people and help our climate and our
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
environment for the future our future
 
01:31:12.770 --> 01:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
generations and I think that you all
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
have the power to take these steps to
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
help us move forward and protect our
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
protect our climate and our help our
 
01:31:23.930 --> 01:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire so I hope you
 
01:31:25.149 --> 01:31:25.159 align:start position:0%

01:32:11.290 --> 01:32:11.300 align:start position:0%
right now just from a citizen Observer
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
of the puc it seems to me that most of
 
01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
the power at setting rates is on the
 
01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
side of the utilities
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
and I would just like to see
 
01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
our Representatives putting a thumb on
 
01:32:28.250 --> 01:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
the scale on the side of the consumers
 
01:32:30.649 --> 01:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
and help us with some guard rails so
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
that we're not we got to plan our
 
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
budgets too and buy groceries and buy
 
01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
medications and I'd just like to see
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
some guard rails set and I do support
 
01:32:45.530 --> 01:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for Ms darling
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you for
 
01:32:53.149 --> 01:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
taking the time to come talk to us today
 
01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
next I'll call on
 
01:32:59.930 --> 01:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
Ms Kaylee Coates of Hooksett New
 
01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire here representing herself
 
01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:06.530 align:start position:0%
Hampshire here representing herself
welcome

01:33:06.530 --> 01:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Kaylee Coates I
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
am a resident of Hooksett I'm here today
 
01:33:13.450 --> 01:33:13.460 align:start position:0%
and to express my support for
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
hb159 it's imperative to book guard
 
01:33:17.689 --> 01:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
rails on the energy procurement process
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
at the New Hampshire Public Utilities
 
01:33:21.890 --> 01:33:21.900 align:start position:0%
Commission the puc is supposed to
 
01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
protect the ratepayers against unjust
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
price hikes however electricity rates
 
01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
have recently doubled the largest
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
increase in New Hampshire history
 
01:33:33.050 --> 01:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
such unchecked increases makes it near
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
impossible for younger Generations like
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
myself to own homes and keep up with
 
01:33:36.719 --> 01:33:37.970 align:start position:0%
myself to own homes and keep up with
utilities

01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
I would like to settle down in the place
 
01:33:42.110 --> 01:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
where I grew up a state that I love but
 
01:33:44.090 --> 01:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
the Steep increases in the cost of
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
living paired with plateauing wages
 
01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
means I soon might have to look
 
01:33:50.890 --> 01:33:50.900 align:start position:0%
elsewhere for places to live
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
these ever increasing bills are common
 
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
topic discussed between my friends and
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
peers I would hate to see a mass
 
01:33:59.629 --> 01:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
migration away from the state
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
being hit with an electric bill that has
 
01:34:04.010 --> 01:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
doubled what I budgeted for means having
 
01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
to sacrifice other necessities in my
 
01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.250 align:start position:0%
to sacrifice other necessities in my
life

01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
furthermore I believe could I interrupt

[Music]
 
01:34:14.209 --> 01:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
well it's interesting to hear the
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
perspective you're providing it doesn't
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
really talk about the substance of the
 
01:34:23.229 --> 01:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
bill do you have any actual substance
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
substantive comments on the use of a
 
01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
five-year running average and other
 
01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
specifics related to the bill
 
01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:33.830 align:start position:0%
specifics related to the bill
sure

01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
um I believe that we need to be
 
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
readjusting the price increases more
 
01:34:41.410 --> 01:34:41.420 align:start position:0%
often than every six months
 
01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
clearly this isn't working if we're
 
01:34:48.110 --> 01:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
having such steep increases from six
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.410 --> 01:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you appreciate you being here
 
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%

01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:57.050 align:start position:0%
to give us your perspective any
questions

01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:34:59.810 --> 01:34:59.820 align:start position:0%

and Miss corkery I'll remind you that
 
01:35:21.169 --> 01:35:21.179 align:start position:0%
we're interested in hearing about the
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
specifics of the bill
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
specifically the rolling five-year
 
01:35:25.679 --> 01:35:28.430 align:start position:0%
specifically the rolling five-year
average

01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
proposal that's in the bill
 
01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
my comments are geared towards the bill
 
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
my name is Catherine corkery and I
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
represent New Hampshire Sierra Club we
 
01:35:49.729 --> 01:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
have over 17
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
000 members and supporters in New
 
01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and our motto is to enjoy
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
explore and protect the Earth
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
today I'm honored to present to the
 
01:36:03.530 --> 01:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
committee that this that the chapter
 
01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:05.709 align:start position:0%
committee that this that the chapter
supports

01:36:05.709 --> 01:36:05.719 align:start position:0%
supports
 
01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
the bill hb159
 
01:36:13.610 --> 01:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
um as noted earlier the puc commission
 
01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:16.860 align:start position:0%
supports the just fair and reasonable
 
01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:18.659 align:start position:0%
standard for rates
 
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
and the statute says the default
 
01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
Services which are designed to minimize
 
01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
customer risk
 
01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
that's what the statute says
 
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
um we've seen these rates this process
 
01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
is broken it's neither just or
 
01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:41.450 align:start position:0%
is broken it's neither just or
reasonable

01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
and the evidence is the doubling of
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
people's electricity bills
 
01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
um I represent people in New Hampshire
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
who've had to face with these doubling
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
rates and I understand that it's
 
01:36:58.490 --> 01:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a pass-through cost
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
meaning that the utilities charge what
 
01:37:03.169 --> 01:37:03.179 align:start position:0%
they pay
 
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna have to stop you there
 
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
remember this bill doesn't talk about
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
the doubling of rates it doesn't talk
 
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
about just and reasonable so please
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
confine your comments to the bill itself
 
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
it's it's in that statute it's pertains
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
to that statute
 
01:37:18.239 --> 01:37:19.729 align:start position:0%
to that statute
and

01:37:19.729 --> 01:37:19.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:24.050 --> 01:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
um I I would I do think my comments
 
01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:31.860 align:start position:0%
what is uh what we see is that the rate
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
hike makes it clear that the fossil fuel
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
Market is unpredictable and Beyond the
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
control of the puc and the state of New
 
01:37:42.719 --> 01:37:43.790 align:start position:0%
control of the puc and the state of New
Hampshire

01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
and what's puzzling is that New
 
01:37:47.810 --> 01:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rates
 
01:37:51.010 --> 01:37:51.020 align:start position:0%
are higher than the rate in other states
 
01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
and even within the state they're not
 
01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:56.770 align:start position:0%
and even within the state they're not
uniform

01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:56.780 align:start position:0%
uniform
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
why what why why why is that and we know
 
01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:05.159 align:start position:0%
that the co-op uses a different model
 
01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
but what about what about the other
 
01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
states why why is it that ever sources
 
01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
rates are so different in every other
 
01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:14.510 align:start position:0%
rates are so different in every other
state

01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
why is it that unitels is different in
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
every other state
 
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.450 align:start position:0%
every other state
and

01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
what are they doing that we're not doing
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
is my question and this bill is to
 
01:38:31.970 --> 01:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
answer that question 15 seconds please
 
01:38:36.050 --> 01:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
I would like to take longer because I
 
01:38:38.990 --> 01:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
have and I will be sending these letters
 
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:38:44.689 --> 01:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
um the portal the state the portal for
 
01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
comments I have collected almost 100
 
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
letters of your constituents
 
01:38:54.050 --> 01:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
and the pain that they are feeling with
 
01:38:56.090 --> 01:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
this rate hike
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
and in particular
 
01:39:02.050 --> 01:39:02.060 align:start position:0%
this idea
 
01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
that we should control what we can and I
 
01:39:08.090 --> 01:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
would like longer time sir
 
01:39:09.770 --> 01:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
um if if I may
 
01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
and 30 seconds I'll give you 30 seconds
 
01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
thank you I I would like longer but uh
 
01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
controlling what we can by putting the
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
guard rails on procurement and focusing
 
01:39:25.129 --> 01:39:25.139 align:start position:0%
away from
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
the fossil fuel
 
01:39:32.689 --> 01:39:32.699 align:start position:0%
sources by investing longer to build
 
01:39:35.930 --> 01:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
resiliency and lower the demand at the
 
01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
source with the rate payers
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
repairs want to spend less on their
 
01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
energy bills and there are ways okay
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
I've given you additional time we need
 
01:39:49.610 --> 01:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
to move on and then quickly I just want
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%

on a fixed income
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%

01:40:03.970 --> 01:40:03.980 align:start position:0%
this is these are people regular people
 
01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:08.040 align:start position:0%

many times we're well aware of the pain
 
01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
and suffering that people are
 
01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:32.100 align:start position:0%

rolling five-year average averaging of
 
01:41:10.129 --> 01:41:10.139 align:start position:0%
electricity cost

prime sponsor who says this is a work in
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
process this is a project something that
 
01:41:34.609 --> 01:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
needs to happen for the good of our
 
01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide constituencies and customers
 
01:41:41.689 --> 01:41:41.699 align:start position:0%
I um The Five-Year average might not be
 
01:41:44.209 --> 01:41:44.219 align:start position:0%
the best basis but there's got to have
 
01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
something we have to have some changes
 
01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
six months isn't working those Peaks and
 
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
valleys for people aren't working and so
 
01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
I one thing that came to mind is I
 
01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
listened to all the testimony that came
 
01:41:58.490 --> 01:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
through from the department and others
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
is that you know I look at what we do uh
 
01:42:06.410 --> 01:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
to buy our oil everybody goes under a
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
contract well not everybody everybody
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
can afford it goes under a contract we
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
have a year contract and then we have
 
01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:15.719 align:start position:0%
the downside protection that we can do
 
01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
why can't we do I don't know this
 
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
process but why can't we do something
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
that at least goes out a year so people
 
01:42:25.850 --> 01:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
know what they're what they're going to
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
be paying for these rates and make it
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
more of a public process now this is
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a public process in this
 
01:42:36.649 --> 01:42:36.659 align:start position:0%
legislation today but I am really hoping
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of work to to be
 
01:42:41.090 --> 01:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
done and it shouldn't just be itl'd that
 
01:42:42.490 --> 01:42:42.500 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know you create a subcommittee and
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
allow more open testimony and more
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts and ideas to go into this
 
01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:50.450 align:start position:0%
thoughts and ideas to go into this
process

01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:42:53.290 --> 01:42:53.300 align:start position:0%
um 30 seconds it is it is credibility
 
01:42:56.090 --> 01:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
that you listen to the public on this
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
and I know you don't want to reiterate
 
01:43:01.129 --> 01:43:01.139 align:start position:0%
you know and I am talking a little bit
 
01:43:04.490 --> 01:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
on my letter but I I am um about my
 
01:43:07.490 --> 01:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
personal situation but um I'm going to
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
hand that out and but I had testimony
 
01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that and I think it's it's
 
01:43:15.709 --> 01:43:15.719 align:start position:0%
valuable that we create a subcommittee
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
so I I encourage you to support this
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
bill in some way work out the
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
Constitutional issues but put it into
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee at least please
 
01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Miss Irwin appreciate it
 
01:43:32.689 --> 01:43:32.699 align:start position:0%
moving along we'll Now call on Mr art
 
01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
Cunningham also from Hopkinton who also
 
01:43:39.530 --> 01:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
apparently represents the Sierra Club
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
Mr Cunningham two minutes please members
 
01:43:43.490 --> 01:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh yeah my name is Art Cunningham uh
 
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
I live in Hopkinton my office is in
 
01:43:52.189 --> 01:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton I'm an attorney
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh and Kathy Corky of the Sierra Club
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
asked me to come in and testify on this
 
01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:58.070 align:start position:0%
asked me to come in and testify on this
bill

01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
my background with the Sierra Club
 
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
my background was Sierra Club over the
 
01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
history as uh but particularly in
 
01:44:09.310 --> 01:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
connection with the eversource
 
01:44:14.169 --> 01:44:14.179 align:start position:0%
uh I worked on the scrubber uh
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
because we believed the scrubber
 
01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
violated the Clean Air Act on the new
 
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
source review standards
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
I've worked on Knox for the Sierra Club
 
01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
because Knox is a problem in the state
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
because we have difficulties with ozone
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
I've made appearance before the air
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
Resources Council and the puc on behalf
 
01:44:36.129 --> 01:44:36.139 align:start position:0%
of Sierra Club and I've worked on
 
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:38.699 align:start position:0%
eversources title V
 
01:44:38.699 --> 01:44:39.770 align:start position:0%
eversources title V
IA

01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
IA
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
the idea of this bill
 
01:44:45.169 --> 01:44:45.179 align:start position:0%
is to provide a cap
 
01:44:48.050 --> 01:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
on these rate spikes let me put it this
 
01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:49.669 align:start position:0%
on these rate spikes let me put it this
way

01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
they go out every six months
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
on an arbitrary date it's like playing
 
01:44:57.550 --> 01:44:57.560 align:start position:0%
Russian roulette
 
01:44:59.930 --> 01:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
whatever the price is in the wholesale
 
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
Market on that date is what the rate
 
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
payers get stuck with
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
that is no way
 
01:45:09.709 --> 01:45:09.719 align:start position:0%
just and reasonable
 
01:45:13.129 --> 01:45:13.139 align:start position:0%
it's no way to treat rate payers and
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's no way for
 
01:45:18.169 --> 01:45:18.179 align:start position:0%
utilities are to serve the public
 
01:45:21.169 --> 01:45:21.179 align:start position:0%
to act now I listened to the Oregon 30
 
01:45:23.090 --> 01:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
seconds please
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
your honor your honor Mr chairman I've
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
spent so many years in court sorry
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
but I have some substantive comments to
 
01:45:34.010 --> 01:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
make about my listening to the Oregon
 
01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:35.750 align:start position:0%
make about my listening to the Oregon
testimony

01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
and one of the questions was that never
 
01:45:42.129 --> 01:45:42.139 align:start position:0%
got answered by the utility by
 
01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
d-e-o-d-o-e or the OCA was what's the
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
source what was the source of this going
 
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
out twice a year
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
why why is that standing as the rule on
 
01:45:59.810 --> 01:45:59.820 align:start position:0%
how wholesale electricity is purchased
 
01:46:02.689 --> 01:46:02.699 align:start position:0%
now what I did and Kathy handed it out
 
01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
the source of that rule is found in
 
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
order number Public Utilities Commission
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
order number 26092
 
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
which was issued in an eversource case
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
on December 29 2017.
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
now it's very very important for this
 
01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%
committee to understand the source of
 
01:46:22.729 --> 01:46:22.739 align:start position:0%
this rule
 
01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
so what I did each each member of the
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
committee now has a copy
 
01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
of this order and what I asked Kathy to
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:04.609 --> 01:47:04.619 align:start position:0%
like I say I think it's critically
 
01:47:05.930 --> 01:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
important for this committee to
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
understand the basis
 
01:47:10.850 --> 01:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
of this what I consider to be absolutely
 
01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:12.470 align:start position:0%
of this what I consider to be absolutely
arbitrary

01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
arbitrary
 
01:47:16.370 --> 01:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
can you explain quickly why
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
understanding this is critical to this
 
01:47:23.090 --> 01:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
because I heard like Mr chairman I heard
 
01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
multiple questions from this committee
 
01:47:27.410 --> 01:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
during the Oregon Bill what is the
 
01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:28.729 align:start position:0%
during the Oregon Bill what is the
source

01:47:28.729 --> 01:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
why is it or why are the utilities
 
01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
buying power twice a year on the
 
01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
wholesale Market on arbitrary days what
 
01:47:40.490 --> 01:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
is the legal source
 
01:47:43.729 --> 01:47:43.739 align:start position:0%
of that practice and I heard misleading
 
01:47:43.739 --> 01:47:44.750 align:start position:0%
of that practice and I heard misleading
answers

01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
answers
 
01:47:48.649 --> 01:47:48.659 align:start position:0%
I heard the eversource lobbyists say
 
01:47:50.930 --> 01:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
while it's in the statute let me assure
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman members of the committee
 
01:47:55.850 --> 01:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
it's not in the statute the source of
 
01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:56.750 align:start position:0%
it's not in the statute the source of
that

01:47:56.750 --> 01:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:58.550 align:start position:0%
that
purchasing

01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
01:48:04.609 --> 01:48:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
okay we get that so thank you we
 
01:48:09.050 --> 01:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
appreciate you giving us that
 
01:48:11.090 --> 01:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
information and if you look through the
 
01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
if if you look through for example on
 
01:48:16.370 --> 01:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:18.050 --> 01:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
if you want to have an understanding of
 
01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
what the statute says
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
with regard to energy purchase look at
 
01:48:25.010 --> 01:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
page 15.
 
01:48:26.930 --> 01:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
that it says and you can look read it
 
01:48:29.810 --> 01:48:29.820 align:start position:0%
for yourself but it says
 
01:48:35.570 --> 01:48:35.580 align:start position:0%
this is RSA 374 F3 4 little C
 
01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
the the important part here is it
 
01:48:40.970 --> 01:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
includes access to service with an
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
option of stable and predictable rates
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
for customers recovery of the cost
 
01:48:47.570 --> 01:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
competitively procured power through
 
01:48:49.490 --> 01:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
Energy Service rates
 
01:48:51.890 --> 01:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
that's what the statute says the statute
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
does not
 
01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
describe the procurement process this
 
01:48:58.750 --> 01:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
order does
 
01:49:03.530 --> 01:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:09.050 --> 01:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:11.450 --> 01:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
you're up over five minutes now
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I would like to finish please
 
01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
do and do it as quickly as you can
 
01:49:19.850 --> 01:49:19.860 align:start position:0%
with due respect
 
01:49:22.250 --> 01:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
this committee needs to know
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
the source of this Authority and they
 
01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
also need to know how it can be fixed
 
01:49:28.199 --> 01:49:33.649 align:start position:0%
also need to know how it can be fixed
and

01:49:33.649 --> 01:49:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
first of all this order specifically
 
01:49:36.719 --> 01:49:38.510 align:start position:0%
first of all this order specifically
provides

01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
provides
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
and you'll find that marked in red that
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
any party
 
01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
including eversource the OCA a member of
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
any party can reapply to the Public
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission to fix this order
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
it can be done not by Statute it can be
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
done simply by order but the problem
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
here is nobody seems to want to do it
 
01:50:07.250 --> 01:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking the legislature
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
to put in this guard rail
 
01:50:12.590 --> 01:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
the force the utilities
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
to go back and figure out a better
 
01:50:17.209 --> 01:50:17.219 align:start position:0%
procurement method
 
01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
and I've got one more suggestion for you
 
01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee as
 
01:50:23.930 --> 01:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
an amendment a proposed amendment
 
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
let's do this let's not
 
01:50:28.910 --> 01:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
let's not impose
 
01:50:32.450 --> 01:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
that's put put a lot put the
 
01:50:34.129 --> 01:50:34.139 align:start position:0%
cap in place
 
01:50:37.129 --> 01:50:37.139 align:start position:0%
but put in a put in a revised Statute by
 
01:50:38.689 --> 01:50:38.699 align:start position:0%
way of amendment
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
that ever Source or Unitil or Liberty
 
01:50:44.930 --> 01:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
are free to go out
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
into the wholesale market and buy
 
01:50:48.119 --> 01:50:49.970 align:start position:0%
into the wholesale market and buy
electricity

01:50:49.970 --> 01:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
whenever the Price Is Right let them
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
have that discretion let them have the
 
01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
authority and let them have the
 
01:50:59.090 --> 01:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
responsibility to responsibly buy
 
01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:00.890 align:start position:0%
responsibility to responsibly buy
electricity

01:51:00.890 --> 01:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
and if and if the purchase of that
 
01:51:05.570 --> 01:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
electricity which is passed through the
 
01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
costs are passed through if
 
01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
the price of that electricity is less
 
01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:12.350 align:start position:0%
the price of that electricity is less
than

01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:51:15.649 --> 01:51:15.659 align:start position:0%
the the rolling five-year average that's
 
01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
in here
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
give the consumers that rate in other
 
01:51:21.890 --> 01:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
words if it's less
 
01:51:25.129 --> 01:51:25.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:27.290 --> 01:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
um in other words built into this
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
statute this statute could use some work
 
01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
but build into that statute if they
 
01:51:38.209 --> 01:51:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
let the consumer have the benefit of
 
01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
that lower rate and I suggest that as an
 
01:51:45.950 --> 01:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
amendment this to this bill
 
01:51:49.070 --> 01:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
let me address one more point
 
01:51:51.770 --> 01:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
aerosource and the DOE
 
01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists all come in all we've got
 
01:51:56.450 --> 01:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
constitutional problems here
 
01:51:59.390 --> 01:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
well think about it if this if the cap
 
01:52:02.209 --> 01:52:02.219 align:start position:0%
is based on retail rates of an average
 
01:52:04.609 --> 01:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
of retail rates
 
01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
if a cap is based on an average of
 
01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
retail rates in the region
 
01:52:11.629 --> 01:52:11.639 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with the utilities in this
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
state why can't they meet the average
 
01:52:18.770 --> 01:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
that that argument is just wrong the
 
01:52:20.209 --> 01:52:20.219 align:start position:0%
other thing I would say about those
 
01:52:22.609 --> 01:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
Market arguments that somehow this is an
 
01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
infringement on their constitutional
 
01:52:27.050 --> 01:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
rights or it'll create stranded costs
 
01:52:29.689 --> 01:52:29.699 align:start position:0%
and whatever and whatever what I would
 
01:52:31.609 --> 01:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
say to this committee
 
01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
if they make such a claim then the puc
 
01:52:38.090 --> 01:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
has the obligation to do a thorough
 
01:52:40.370 --> 01:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
going audit
 
01:52:43.370 --> 01:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
of why they make that argument in other
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
words this is not Mr chairman members of
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
committee kid games
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know why you would sit here and
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
listen to these blanket statements to
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
all this will put us into bankruptcy or
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
this is improper take it that is a wrong
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
orbit keep in mind let me repeat this
 
01:53:05.450 --> 01:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
average is a of retail rates
 
01:53:07.729 --> 01:53:07.739 align:start position:0%
so everybody else in the region is doing
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
it why can't they and if they make that
 
01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
claim oh
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
this is unconstitutional or this is the
 
01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:18.719 align:start position:0%
taking let the puc examine their books
 
01:53:21.050 --> 01:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
and Records
 
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for allowing a
 
01:53:25.609 --> 01:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
bit of extra time but this is a serious
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
matter that needs serious study by this
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
committee and by the full legislature
 
01:53:34.010 --> 01:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
your refusal to honor the time limits
 
01:53:40.189 --> 01:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
that we've requested for the committee
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't done your cause
 
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
any good
 
01:53:46.669 --> 01:53:46.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sir thank you for being here I
 
01:53:48.890 --> 01:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
we'll move on now and I'll call on
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
and I apologize if I mispronounce the
 
01:53:56.159 --> 01:53:56.990 align:start position:0%
and I apologize if I mispronounce the

01:53:56.990 --> 01:53:57.000 align:start position:0%

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.270 align:start position:0%
name

bialoski
 
01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:02.639 align:start position:0%
I hope I got that right
 
01:54:06.050 --> 01:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
and please two minutes and please
 
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
confine your comments to the subject of
 
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:54:10.689 --> 01:54:10.699 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and representatives
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
so my name is Elizabeth bialoski and I'm
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist for 350 New Hampshire I also
 
01:54:22.250 --> 01:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
have a master's degree from University
 
01:54:25.070 --> 01:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
of Denver in Social Work concentrating
 
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
in energy and environmental policy
 
01:54:30.590 --> 01:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
I strongly support
 
01:54:33.229 --> 01:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
um hp159 and I believe it is necessary
 
01:54:35.450 --> 01:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
for economic and energy stability in New
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the utility rate increases
 
01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
over the past year have been
 
01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:40.679 align:start position:0%
unprecedented and a huge financial
 
01:54:42.770 --> 01:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
burden on many New Hampshire residents
 
01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
and families I do believe personal
 
01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
testimony for that is important and
 
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
can't be minimized no matter how often
 
01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
or frequent it's being brought up
 
01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
calculating rates based on a five-year
 
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
average with both stabilized pricing for
 
01:54:57.649 --> 01:54:57.659 align:start position:0%
residents as well as create transparency
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
from utility companies
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
for example eversource reported 1.4
 
01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in profit for 2022 which
 
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
is 184 million dollar increase from
 
01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
2021. there's definitely a problem right
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
now with market and supply and I
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that but there's also a
 
01:55:16.609 --> 01:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
discrepancy between price and utility
 
01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
company profits right now as well that
 
01:55:20.570 --> 01:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
is relevant to why this bill is
 
01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:21.770 align:start position:0%
is relevant to why this bill is
important

01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
utility companies should not be able to
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
Skyrocket prices on a whim and it's
 
01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
concerning how many of these companies
 
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
are hitting record profits while our
 
01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
residents can't afford to keep heat on
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
in the winter consequently I support
 
01:55:36.590 --> 01:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
this bill and any amendments that take
 
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
um market price into acknowledgments as
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
well as the fact that every other region
 
01:55:43.729 --> 01:55:43.739 align:start position:0%
in New England has been able to adopt
 
01:55:46.609 --> 01:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
similar policies to this I'll also take
 
01:55:49.729 --> 01:55:49.739 align:start position:0%
questions if anyone has any
 
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for keeping in your time limit
 
01:55:55.129 --> 01:55:55.139 align:start position:0%
and well spoken I we all appreciate that
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:01.129 --> 01:56:01.139 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:56:03.229 --> 01:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna you're excused thank you
 
01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
very much thank you for your time yes
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I'd like just just to make
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
one statement before we move on just a a
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
very short statement because some of you
 
01:56:16.490 --> 01:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
haven't been here all year or uh and we
 
01:56:19.250 --> 01:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
receive a lot of testimonies and
 
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
information I don't want anyone out
 
01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
there to think that this committee all
 
01:56:28.189 --> 01:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
of us here do does not understand what's
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
going on with the rate hikes the uh or
 
01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
how they're determined or that we or
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
that we are just listening to only one
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
side we listen
 
01:56:42.169 --> 01:56:42.179 align:start position:0%
to almost every Bill involves some sort
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
of rate hike
 
01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
in information
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
we absolutely hear what the public is
 
01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
saying I have people in my own
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
constituents who I have visited that are
 
01:56:58.430 --> 01:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
almost living in squalor because of
 
01:57:03.169 --> 01:57:03.179 align:start position:0%
these high rates we get it uh we there
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
are systems there's bureaucracies we are
 
01:57:07.609 --> 01:57:07.619 align:start position:0%
trying to find a good way I personally
 
01:57:10.910 --> 01:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
feel this bill is a a nice attempt to
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
address it I think there's some
 
01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
obstacles in there but you know we're
 
01:57:16.490 --> 01:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
we're going to work our way through some
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
of them whichever Bill works I just want
 
01:57:20.510 --> 01:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
the public to understand that and I
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate your concern we understand
 
01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
everything here thank you for that for
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
you know that's right we and we were
 
01:57:33.890 --> 01:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
well aware of the puc order I don't know
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh where someone may have gotten the
 
01:57:38.089 --> 01:57:38.099 align:start position:0%
idea that we that that we didn't know
 
01:57:40.609 --> 01:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
that that order existed but it was not
 
01:57:42.589 --> 01:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
in statute we knew about the puc order
 
01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
and that's an issue that could be worked
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
given some time but we will uh we are
 
01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
definitely looking at those things I
 
01:57:52.970 --> 01:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
think I made a comment earlier today
 
01:57:56.209 --> 01:57:56.219 align:start position:0%
about one utilities your method seems to
 
01:57:57.229 --> 01:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
be working a little better than
 
01:57:59.390 --> 01:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
something else that's in shoe that we
 
01:58:01.970 --> 01:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
can bring up uh I'd like to move on and
 
01:58:05.209 --> 01:58:05.219 align:start position:0%
go to the next uh speaker which is Tom
 
01:58:05.219 --> 01:58:07.330 align:start position:0%
go to the next uh speaker which is Tom
Warrior

01:58:07.330 --> 01:58:07.340 align:start position:0%
Warrior
 
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me I didn't pronounce your name
 
01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:10.910 align:start position:0%
excuse me I didn't pronounce your name
right

01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
for you that's right
 
01:58:16.990 --> 01:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
thanks very much good morning everyone
 
01:58:22.370 --> 01:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
maybe I should be speaking into this but
 
01:58:24.410 --> 01:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time brevity I'm
 
01:58:27.290 --> 01:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
going to adhere to that policy it's been
 
01:58:30.169 --> 01:58:30.179 align:start position:0%
repeated uh but I just wanted to
 
01:58:30.179 --> 01:58:30.890 align:start position:0%
repeated uh but I just wanted to
um

01:58:30.890 --> 01:58:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
I had a question for somebody in the
 
01:58:34.609 --> 01:58:34.619 align:start position:0%
back here that spoke earlier
 
01:58:37.490 --> 01:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
but the recurring theme just seems to be
 
01:58:40.609 --> 01:58:40.619 align:start position:0%
without doubt that this six-month you
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
know going out to uh you know by
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
eversource and maybe it's other
 
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
utilities too including Liberty where
 
01:58:48.649 --> 01:58:48.659 align:start position:0%
I'm from I'm from Salem New Hampshire
 
01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
um it needs to be more frequent I bet
 
01:58:53.209 --> 01:58:53.219 align:start position:0%
the technology is there I bet eversource
 
01:58:55.850 --> 01:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
adds that technology as well
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
um so that's a recurring thing
 
01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know I did some you know
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
statistics I'm big on that and I learned
 
01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
that uh New Hampshire was the second uh
 
01:59:09.050 --> 01:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
most expensive in the country for
 
01:59:12.169 --> 01:59:12.179 align:start position:0%
electric utility rates behind Hawaii
 
01:59:14.689 --> 01:59:14.699 align:start position:0%
which you might understand why they may
 
01:59:14.699 --> 01:59:15.410 align:start position:0%
which you might understand why they may
be

01:59:15.410 --> 01:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
but my question is do you have a source
 
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
rep spoke earlier and he was mentioning
 
01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
that there are various methods that they
 
01:59:27.229 --> 01:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
can use to look into to level the rate
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
volatility what if he has any examples
 
01:59:31.250 --> 01:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
of that and what they might be working
 
01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:33.229 align:start position:0%
of that and what they might be working
on

01:59:33.229 --> 01:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:59:37.609 --> 01:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
I think he's behind nope I I don't know
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
there he is
 
01:59:47.410 --> 01:59:47.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
is this something that eversource would
 
01:59:55.490 --> 01:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:58.370 --> 01:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
he's uh you know he's he's taking up
 
01:59:59.870 --> 01:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
your time so whatever he wants to answer
 
02:00:10.010 --> 02:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:12.530 --> 02:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
uh again Michael Licata ever Source
 
02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:13.790 align:start position:0%
uh again Michael Licata ever Source
energy

02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:14.810 align:start position:0%
energy
um

02:00:14.810 --> 02:00:14.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
so I I think the question was in
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
reference to what are other ways that
 
02:00:20.689 --> 02:00:20.699 align:start position:0%
the utility could procure default
 
02:00:23.689 --> 02:00:23.699 align:start position:0%
Service uh and has was mentioned
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
previously today
 
02:00:28.850 --> 02:00:28.860 align:start position:0%
um one could go out for more frequent
 
02:00:31.609 --> 02:00:31.619 align:start position:0%
solicitations for smaller amount of load
 
02:00:34.729 --> 02:00:34.739 align:start position:0%
that's often called laddering as was
 
02:00:36.530 --> 02:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
referenced by
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
one of the testifiers that is what we do
 
02:00:41.930 --> 02:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
in um Massachusetts and Connecticut and
 
02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:43.679 align:start position:0%
I would just point out as I did in my
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
previous testimony
 
02:00:49.910 --> 02:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh on HB 633 when I did in fact cite the
 
02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
order uh required by the commission
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
um that that was our original proposal
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh coming out of divestiture in New
 
02:01:02.089 --> 02:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and the commission uh did
 
02:01:04.129 --> 02:01:04.139 align:start position:0%
not want to go in that direction they
 
02:01:08.510 --> 02:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to tie the rates to the market uh
 
02:01:10.370 --> 02:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
so that customers would see market price
 
02:01:12.589 --> 02:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
signals so that's certainly something we
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
could do there's also different varying
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
lengths of time for the procurements
 
02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
right now again per puc order which is
 
02:01:24.250 --> 02:01:24.260 align:start position:0%
supported by New Hampshire statute
 
02:01:28.070 --> 02:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
the company goes out every six months in
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
Maine they go out every year for yearly
 
02:01:35.330 --> 02:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
setting again that could be a way to to
 
02:01:38.089 --> 02:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
stabilize prices instead of six month
 
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
solicitations one year solicitation so
 
02:01:42.530 --> 02:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
there's a number of different levers one
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
could could use and as I test Justified
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
to earlier were happy to engage in those
 
02:01:50.209 --> 02:01:50.219 align:start position:0%
conversations with stakeholders the bill
 
02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor the committee
 
02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
to adopt public policy to provide more
 
02:01:57.310 --> 02:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
stability versus
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
Market exposure
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for uh keeping with the
 
02:02:05.689 --> 02:02:05.699 align:start position:0%
time one one quick
 
02:02:08.930 --> 02:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
uh confirmation or something uh a
 
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
utility such as eversource you you
 
02:02:13.490 --> 02:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
cannot just arbitrarily go out and
 
02:02:16.490 --> 02:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
change your method of uh pricing or
 
02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
change your method of of uh how you're
 
02:02:21.770 --> 02:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
supplying electricity uh without
 
02:02:23.629 --> 02:02:23.639 align:start position:0%
guidance from the state is that a
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
correct statement that that is correct
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh the current process is authorized by
 
02:02:32.089 --> 02:02:32.099 align:start position:0%
puc order again supported by New
 
02:02:34.970 --> 02:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute if we were to change
 
02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
that process we would have to make a
 
02:02:38.570 --> 02:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
filing with the Public Utilities
 
02:02:40.490 --> 02:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
Commission as previously mentioned
 
02:02:42.530 --> 02:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
there's an ongoing investigation looking
 
02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
at the manner at the Public Utilities
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
Commission looking at the manner by
 
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
which all the utilities procure uh Power
 
02:02:51.050 --> 02:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
but it would be an adjudicative
 
02:02:53.330 --> 02:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
proceeding and ultimately if you see
 
02:02:55.729 --> 02:02:55.739 align:start position:0%
order that would direct us to make a
 
02:02:55.739 --> 02:02:56.450 align:start position:0%
order that would direct us to make a
change

02:02:56.450 --> 02:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:02:59.450 --> 02:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
um I really Mr Lakota was not really the
 
02:03:05.089 --> 02:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
testifier uh I'd like to move on to our
 
02:03:05.099 --> 02:03:06.050 align:start position:0%
testifier uh I'd like to move on to our
last

02:03:06.050 --> 02:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
speaker first if you have questions then
 
02:03:10.970 --> 02:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
we can we can deal with them
 
02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
and I will call our last speaker Mr
 
02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:15.719 align:start position:0%
Dominic Osmond
 
02:03:19.729 --> 02:03:19.739 align:start position:0%
oh well okay thank you for keeping
 
02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
within your time Dominic
 
02:03:26.209 --> 02:03:26.219 align:start position:0%
uh with that said is there a question
 
02:03:27.770 --> 02:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
from the committee that we can answer
 
02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
while we're here
 
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative one you have a short
 
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
question well my question is for Mr
 
02:03:36.410 --> 02:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
locata if he's allowed to come back go
 
02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:37.970 align:start position:0%
locata if he's allowed to come back go
ahead

02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
02:03:42.890 --> 02:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thanks for your your
 
02:03:47.689 --> 02:03:47.699 align:start position:0%
uh your flexibility here
 
02:03:51.050 --> 02:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
um so uh the fact that you're doing the
 
02:03:53.209 --> 02:03:53.219 align:start position:0%
fact that you're doing laddering in
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Connecticut that would
 
02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
suggest to me that you've got the the
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
processes the analytical tools
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
Etc in place to do that would that
 
02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
assuming that either the puc or the
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
legislature allowed you to do that in MA
 
02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire would that would it be
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
a fairly s seamless
 
02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
um that's well would it be would it be
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
easier easy for you to make that
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
transition to that type of a model yeah
 
02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:04:23.699 --> 02:04:24.290 align:start position:0%
the the
um

02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:24.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:27.169 --> 02:04:27.179 align:start position:0%
the the concept of an execution of
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
lottery in and of itself is is not
 
02:04:32.689 --> 02:04:32.699 align:start position:0%
difficult or technically complex and we
 
02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
can certainly
 
02:04:38.330 --> 02:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
accommodate that it's you know obviously
 
02:04:39.709 --> 02:04:39.719 align:start position:0%
each state does it a little bit
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
differently Connecticut does a little
 
02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
bit differently than Massachusetts
 
02:04:43.970 --> 02:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
presumably of New Hampshire went in that
 
02:04:45.050 --> 02:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
direction it might be a little bit
 
02:04:46.970 --> 02:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
different than those two states but we
 
02:04:49.490 --> 02:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
could certainly accommodate that
 
02:04:51.530 --> 02:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
um I I would just point out and I know
 
02:04:54.410 --> 02:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
it's been said so laddering in and of
 
02:04:57.709 --> 02:04:57.719 align:start position:0%
itself does not reduce cost laddering
 
02:04:57.719 --> 02:04:59.390 align:start position:0%
itself does not reduce cost laddering
provides

02:04:59.390 --> 02:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
provides
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
um more stability in pricing and I know
 
02:05:06.290 --> 02:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
the it was referenced our rates in other
 
02:05:09.169 --> 02:05:09.179 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions I would just point out
 
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
that those are currently higher than our
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
rate in New Hampshire today even with
 
02:05:16.970 --> 02:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
the lattering so we're all procuring
 
02:05:20.030 --> 02:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
from the same Market it's just how much
 
02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
are you procuring at what point in time
 
02:05:26.570 --> 02:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
and for what duration and so
 
02:05:30.290 --> 02:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
um you know the as Mr Rober spoke you
 
02:05:32.930 --> 02:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
know there are real challenges that are
 
02:05:35.089 --> 02:05:35.099 align:start position:0%
driving costs in the market and it is by
 
02:05:37.729 --> 02:05:37.739 align:start position:0%
and large tied to the cost of natural
 
02:05:42.790 --> 02:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
gas which is a global commodity and so
 
02:05:45.709 --> 02:05:45.719 align:start position:0%
different procurement strategies as
 
02:05:47.629 --> 02:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams said can have
 
02:05:49.850 --> 02:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
different outcomes of trying to provide
 
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
some level of stability but ultimately
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're all buying from the same market
 
02:05:58.609 --> 02:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
and market prices are what they are
 
02:06:01.370 --> 02:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you good okay with that said
 
02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
no other for no further questions
 
02:06:06.530 --> 02:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
and seeing none other speakers available
 
02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
I will declare this public hearing
 
02:06:08.639 --> 02:06:10.189 align:start position:0%

04:11:32.809 --> 04:11:32.819 align:start position:0%
uh renewable energy projects
 
04:11:34.670 --> 04:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
which I recognize representative Thomas
 
04:11:34.680 --> 04:11:36.290 align:start position:0%
which I recognize representative Thomas
second

04:11:36.290 --> 04:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:11:38.210 --> 04:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
been moved and seconded that we
 
04:11:38.220 --> 04:11:39.889 align:start position:0%
been moved and seconded that we
reconsider

04:11:39.889 --> 04:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
reconsider
 
04:11:43.309 --> 04:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
our decision earlier on House Bill 139
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
as you'll recall
 
04:11:47.630 --> 04:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
we tried to come to a conclusion on that
 
04:11:51.889 --> 04:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
bill we were unsuccessful and we arrived
 
04:11:53.450 --> 04:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
at a conclusion of without
 
04:11:53.460 --> 04:11:55.429 align:start position:0%
at a conclusion of without
recommendation

04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
04:11:57.410 --> 04:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
since that time
 
04:12:01.490 --> 04:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
I have worked with the ranking member to
 
04:12:04.849 --> 04:12:04.859 align:start position:0%
create a possible Avenue for
 
04:12:08.090 --> 04:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
compromise on this bill I've prepared an
 
04:12:08.100 --> 04:12:09.290 align:start position:0%
compromise on this bill I've prepared an
amendment

04:12:09.290 --> 04:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:12:09.300 --> 04:12:10.790 align:start position:0%
amendment
and

04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
that was the reason for calling for
 
04:12:18.530 --> 04:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
so I would like to hear any discussion
 
04:12:27.349 --> 04:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
regarding whether we should reconsider
 
04:12:30.110 --> 04:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
our action on House Bill 139. does
 
04:12:31.849 --> 04:12:31.859 align:start position:0%
anybody have anything
 
04:12:33.889 --> 04:12:33.899 align:start position:0%
to say
 
04:12:36.650 --> 04:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
04:12:38.809 --> 04:12:38.819 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair um I would like to
 
04:12:43.010 --> 04:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
say that uh this is a really great step
 
04:12:45.889 --> 04:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
uh to moving forward with removing the
 
04:12:47.870 --> 04:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
constraint on Municipal Geographic
 
04:12:51.050 --> 04:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
boundaries to allow municipalities to
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
install potential solar array in a
 
04:12:55.849 --> 04:12:55.859 align:start position:0%
neighboring town if their own town does
 
04:12:57.950 --> 04:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
not have land or space or rooftops to do
 
04:12:57.960 --> 04:12:58.929 align:start position:0%
not have land or space or rooftops to do
it

04:12:58.929 --> 04:12:58.939 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:13:01.370 --> 04:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
my caucus has reviewed this amendment
 
04:13:04.010 --> 04:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
and it's an excellent first step to at
 
04:13:05.389 --> 04:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
least push forward allowing
 
04:13:07.969 --> 04:13:07.979 align:start position:0%
municipalities to net meter outside of
 
04:13:09.769 --> 04:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
their own geographic area
 
04:13:14.210 --> 04:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
however upon discussion are our concerns
 
04:13:15.889 --> 04:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
with this amendment is that there is a
 
04:13:18.050 --> 04:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
requirement that the municipality own
 
04:13:20.570 --> 04:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
the in this case likely solar panels
 
04:13:24.170 --> 04:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
outright and generally the way that we
 
04:13:26.689 --> 04:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
can make these projects pencil is by the
 
04:13:28.550 --> 04:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
municipality doing a power purchase
 
04:13:30.769 --> 04:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
agreement for the first five years and
 
04:13:33.170 --> 04:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
then purchasing the array and so
 
04:13:34.849 --> 04:13:34.859 align:start position:0%
therefore I would ask that we actually
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
close the reconsideration today and
 
04:13:39.950 --> 04:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
reconsider on Tuesday with a further
 
04:13:43.189 --> 04:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
amendment to allow some kind of a PPA
 
04:13:45.410 --> 04:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
lease agreement to make it actually work
 
04:13:47.210 --> 04:13:47.220 align:start position:0%
financially for these municipalities
 
04:13:49.969 --> 04:13:49.979 align:start position:0%
just to reflect the realities of the
 
04:13:51.950 --> 04:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
market thank you
 
04:13:54.349 --> 04:13:54.359 align:start position:0%
representative naino Reynolds do you
 
04:13:55.910 --> 04:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
have a comment
 
04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
I do thanks Mr chairman yes
 
04:14:01.250 --> 04:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
um I can speak from experience on this
 
04:14:03.229 --> 04:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
of course having worked in this field
 
04:14:05.150 --> 04:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
and I I really
 
04:14:06.830 --> 04:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
I I think
 
04:14:11.689 --> 04:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
that it's a good bill to remove the
 
04:14:11.699 --> 04:14:13.010 align:start position:0%
that it's a good bill to remove the
artificial

04:14:13.010 --> 04:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
artificial
 
04:14:17.210 --> 04:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
uh constraint that you know of adjacency
 
04:14:20.210 --> 04:14:20.220 align:start position:0%
Municipal boundaries group net metering
 
04:14:23.210 --> 04:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
can take place anywhere within the same
 
04:14:25.070 --> 04:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
ought to be able to take place
 
04:14:27.530 --> 04:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
anywhere within a utilities service
 
04:14:30.229 --> 04:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
territory because energy goes into the
 
04:14:32.809 --> 04:14:32.819 align:start position:0%
grid it can be credited to customers
 
04:14:37.070 --> 04:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
anywhere with respect to the situation
 
04:14:38.990 --> 04:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
04:14:40.670 --> 04:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
um McWilliams was just addressing I
 
04:14:42.710 --> 04:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
think the bill should just remain silent
 
04:14:42.720 --> 04:14:43.849 align:start position:0%
think the bill should just remain silent
about

04:14:43.849 --> 04:14:43.859 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:14:48.170 --> 04:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
uh ownership structure uh and that we
 
04:14:49.969 --> 04:14:49.979 align:start position:0%
here at the legislature should Empower
 
04:14:53.870 --> 04:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
our our towns uh to enter into whatever
 
04:14:55.570 --> 04:14:55.580 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
04:14:58.670 --> 04:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know contracts Arrangements that
 
04:14:58.680 --> 04:14:59.750 align:start position:0%
uh you know contracts Arrangements that
they

04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:15:02.570 --> 04:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
that they see fit uh in order to benefit
 
04:15:05.030 --> 04:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
from from group net metering um you know
 
04:15:06.889 --> 04:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
Town managers Town energy committees
 
04:15:10.849 --> 04:15:10.859 align:start position:0%
stuff boards can can judge
 
04:15:12.889 --> 04:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
the financial Arrangement and how it
 
04:15:14.090 --> 04:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
works for them I don't think we should
 
04:15:15.469 --> 04:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
put the constraint about they have to
 
04:15:17.750 --> 04:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
own it because as as representative
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
McWilliams said the most frequent way is
 
04:15:21.530 --> 04:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
for an investor to own it at first
 
04:15:23.150 --> 04:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
because they can they're the ones that
 
04:15:24.950 --> 04:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
can benefit from the tax credits that
 
04:15:27.710 --> 04:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
are available and towns cannot so that's
 
04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay it usually works let's not debate
 
04:15:32.090 --> 04:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
the okay merits of the amendment because
 
04:15:34.790 --> 04:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have an amendment before us yet
 
04:15:38.330 --> 04:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
so are there any further comments on
 
04:15:40.550 --> 04:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should reconsider this
 
04:15:47.389 --> 04:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:50.269 --> 04:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
my rationale behind reconsidering the
 
04:15:50.279 --> 04:15:50.929 align:start position:0%
my rationale behind reconsidering the
bill

04:15:50.929 --> 04:15:50.939 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:15:52.910 --> 04:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
was to
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
see if we could find a way
 
04:15:57.830 --> 04:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
to compromise and come up with a with a
 
04:15:57.840 --> 04:16:00.710 align:start position:0%
to compromise and come up with a with a
resolution

04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:02.809 --> 04:16:02.819 align:start position:0%
in order to get there I think we have to
 
04:16:05.870 --> 04:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
vote to reconsider it
 
04:16:09.050 --> 04:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
that reopens the exact session on the
 
04:16:09.060 --> 04:16:10.010 align:start position:0%
that reopens the exact session on the
bill

04:16:10.010 --> 04:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:16:13.610 --> 04:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
and we can then recess the exact session
 
04:16:17.389 --> 04:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
to do further work on the amendment
 
04:16:19.670 --> 04:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
if we deem that to be necessary but the
 
04:16:22.969 --> 04:16:22.979 align:start position:0%
first step is to reconsider the decision
 
04:16:24.769 --> 04:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
that we made
 
04:16:27.889 --> 04:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
a week ago two weeks ago whenever it was
 
04:16:30.650 --> 04:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
so representative McWilliams
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Vos I believe you're
 
04:16:34.250 --> 04:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
correct that we do have to reconsider in
 
04:16:35.990 --> 04:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
order to open it and so I would
 
04:16:37.610 --> 04:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
recommend reconsider to open and then
 
04:16:39.530 --> 04:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
recess at this point
 
04:16:42.590 --> 04:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
04:16:45.110 --> 04:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas thank you Mr
 
04:16:47.510 --> 04:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
chair uh every once in a while we come
 
04:16:50.929 --> 04:16:50.939 align:start position:0%
across a situation where we uh vote one
 
04:16:52.849 --> 04:16:52.859 align:start position:0%
way but then soon after we find out
 
04:16:55.550 --> 04:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
there's maybe a path forward this is one
 
04:16:58.550 --> 04:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
of those cases so I wholly support uh
 
04:17:02.929 --> 04:17:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.630 --> 04:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative closure
 
04:17:08.870 --> 04:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair I'm in a favor for I
 
04:17:10.729 --> 04:17:10.739 align:start position:0%
look back on the notes we talked on 20
 
04:17:15.110 --> 04:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
minutes before we decided to on the uh
 
04:17:16.370 --> 04:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
bear with me
 
04:17:21.410 --> 04:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
HBO 139 on February 3rd at
 
04:17:23.630 --> 04:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
two o'clock we were talking on that to 2
 
04:17:25.610 --> 04:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
20. I think a lot of things were said
 
04:17:27.969 --> 04:17:27.979 align:start position:0%
then I I think there is reason to
 
04:17:32.510 --> 04:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
reconsider this so yes I vote for it
 
04:17:35.570 --> 04:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:17:37.490 --> 04:17:37.500 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
um I recommend itl on HB 208
 
04:19:50.750 --> 04:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
. Jay recognizes representative naughter
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
I second the motion
 
04:19:55.610 --> 04:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
it has been moved and seconded that we
 
04:19:59.870 --> 04:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
judge House Bill 208 to be
 
04:20:02.750 --> 04:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
referred to the floor as inexpedient to
 
04:20:04.849 --> 04:20:04.859 align:start position:0%
legislate is there any discussion on
 
04:20:04.859 --> 04:20:05.809 align:start position:0%
legislate is there any discussion on
this

04:20:05.809 --> 04:20:05.819 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:20:08.210 --> 04:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you Mr
 
04:20:11.330 --> 04:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
04:20:14.450 --> 04:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
um we looked at this bill and a lot of
 
04:20:17.210 --> 04:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
good points in it but we heard testimony
 
04:20:19.969 --> 04:20:19.979 align:start position:0%
from Des that the bill doesn't address
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
funding that they estimate they would
 
04:20:25.309 --> 04:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
need three additional staff members to
 
04:20:27.650 --> 04:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
um uh to do what this bill would would
 
04:20:30.590 --> 04:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
require them to do it would require a
 
04:20:34.010 --> 04:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
rewrite of the of the of the energy plan
 
04:20:36.950 --> 04:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
that do we has out there and that there
 
04:20:39.110 --> 04:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
was too short a time that this Bill had
 
04:20:41.330 --> 04:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
in here to do any of these things at all
 
04:20:43.490 --> 04:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
and for these reasons I just don't think
 
04:20:45.830 --> 04:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
the bill is quite ready and that's why I
 
04:20:48.050 --> 04:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
recommend itl
 
04:20:50.870 --> 04:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion to itl
 
04:20:55.070 --> 04:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:57.469 --> 04:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
representative Christian
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
04:21:02.330 --> 04:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
um I believe we tried to get an
 
04:21:04.610 --> 04:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
amendment made that would deal with some
 
04:21:08.030 --> 04:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
of the language issues and funding
 
04:21:10.969 --> 04:21:10.979 align:start position:0%
issues that were brought forward I'm not
 
04:21:12.830 --> 04:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
sure why that was not allowed to come
 
04:21:12.840 --> 04:21:14.210 align:start position:0%
sure why that was not allowed to come
forward

04:21:14.210 --> 04:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:21:15.950 --> 04:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
um a few other points that I had wanted
 
04:21:18.170 --> 04:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
to make in introducing this bill but
 
04:21:20.570 --> 04:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was incapacitated and
 
04:21:22.189 --> 04:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
unable to do
 
04:21:22.199 --> 04:21:23.030 align:start position:0%
unable to do
um

04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:25.309 --> 04:21:25.319 align:start position:0%
it's been said many times sorry that
 
04:21:27.290 --> 04:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
it's a cliche but failing to plan is
 
04:21:29.090 --> 04:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
planning to fail
 
04:21:32.030 --> 04:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
um we do not have a
 
04:21:34.790 --> 04:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
a real climate action plan a real plan
 
04:21:37.370 --> 04:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
for the transition to renewable energies
 
04:21:40.670 --> 04:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
currently and I think that this is you
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
know a real failure of our for our
 
04:21:42.720 --> 04:21:44.269 align:start position:0%
know a real failure of our for our
constituents

04:21:44.269 --> 04:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
04:21:46.790 --> 04:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
um we have a fiduciary duty to our
 
04:21:49.490 --> 04:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
constituents to pursue renewable energy
 
04:21:51.729 --> 04:21:51.739 align:start position:0%
which will save money in the long term
 
04:21:54.710 --> 04:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
I provided some information from a
 
04:21:56.990 --> 04:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
recent study that was out last year in
 
04:21:59.870 --> 04:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
the journal Jewel that showed
 
04:22:02.150 --> 04:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
the difference between uh
 
04:22:04.250 --> 04:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
pursuing Renewables early and pursuing
 
04:22:07.070 --> 04:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
late and how much that will cost or save
 
04:22:08.889 --> 04:22:08.899 align:start position:0%
us respectively
 
04:22:11.689 --> 04:22:11.699 align:start position:0%
also you know we have a duty to our
 
04:22:14.630 --> 04:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
constituents to protect the environment
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
remove particulates get away from fossil
 
04:22:18.830 --> 04:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
fuels I think there are many reasons
 
04:22:21.710 --> 04:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
that we need a a serious plan to
 
04:22:24.769 --> 04:22:24.779 align:start position:0%
transition to renewable energies and
 
04:22:24.779 --> 04:22:25.370 align:start position:0%
transition to renewable energies and
um

04:22:25.370 --> 04:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:27.710 --> 04:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
you know if we need to to make edits to
 
04:22:29.330 --> 04:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
this bill to get that to happen I'm
 
04:22:31.729 --> 04:22:31.739 align:start position:0%
absolutely open to that but I really
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
think we can't continue kicking this can
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:38.870 --> 04:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any further
 
04:22:41.870 --> 04:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion to itl House
 
04:22:44.150 --> 04:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 208 representative Wendy Thomas
 
04:22:46.370 --> 04:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:22:47.870 --> 04:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
um just looking at my notes during the
 
04:22:50.510 --> 04:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
hearing the climate action plan would
 
04:22:52.309 --> 04:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
also include the impact on environment
 
04:22:54.650 --> 04:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
which is so important for any kind of
 
04:22:56.870 --> 04:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
energy plan going forward and that seems
 
04:22:59.150 --> 04:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
to be missing from some of the other
 
04:23:02.809 --> 04:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
initiatives that we've talked about also
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
um this this uh
 
04:23:08.570 --> 04:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
at climate action plan would look at the
 
04:23:11.330 --> 04:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
economic impact on on property value
 
04:23:14.990 --> 04:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
which is being affected with with the
 
04:23:18.650 --> 04:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:20.990 --> 04:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Munds
 
04:23:22.910 --> 04:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
as a comment thank you Mr chair I'd just
 
04:23:25.070 --> 04:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
like to uh
 
04:23:27.530 --> 04:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
um Echo what uh representative Christian
 
04:23:30.889 --> 04:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
said about you know the importance of
 
04:23:33.769 --> 04:23:33.779 align:start position:0%
having a plan and I would add that
 
04:23:36.769 --> 04:23:36.779 align:start position:0%
um having this type of plan is also good
 
04:23:40.130 --> 04:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire business and for
 
04:23:43.250 --> 04:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
continued economic development in our
 
04:23:46.550 --> 04:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
state the one thing that businesses look
 
04:23:48.590 --> 04:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
for when they're thinking about
 
04:23:50.990 --> 04:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
investing in the future is some sense of
 
04:23:53.510 --> 04:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
certainty of some plan as to what the
 
04:23:55.910 --> 04:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
future looks like and
 
04:23:58.490 --> 04:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
um I think it's very important that we
 
04:24:03.650 --> 04:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
that we provide a a framework for how
 
04:24:06.650 --> 04:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
the state plans to address climate
 
04:24:09.710 --> 04:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
change and hopefully
 
04:24:12.050 --> 04:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
make it give them some certainty as to
 
04:24:13.309 --> 04:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
what they can expect as they're making
 
04:24:16.990 --> 04:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:19.070 --> 04:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:24:21.469 --> 04:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan
 
04:24:23.689 --> 04:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I just want to
 
04:24:25.309 --> 04:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
add to
 
04:24:28.010 --> 04:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
the voices calling for a little bit of
 
04:24:30.050 --> 04:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
wisdom from the legislature in terms of
 
04:24:32.510 --> 04:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
looking forward into the future and
 
04:24:34.790 --> 04:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
especially for young people in the state
 
04:24:36.590 --> 04:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
who feel that
 
04:24:39.290 --> 04:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
you know we as a legislature are a
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
little bit out of touch because of
 
04:24:44.570 --> 04:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
various factors and maybe feeling that
 
04:24:46.990 --> 04:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
they are not being represented and
 
04:24:49.070 --> 04:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
you know the fact that we're not even
 
04:24:52.910 --> 04:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about the largest threat uh
 
04:24:57.290 --> 04:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
that they face in their future uh and as
 
04:24:58.849 --> 04:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
a science technology and energy
 
04:24:58.859 --> 04:25:00.490 align:start position:0%
a science technology and energy
committee

04:25:00.490 --> 04:25:00.500 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:25:04.910 --> 04:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
choosing to you know to follow a
 
04:25:07.130 --> 04:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
cost-benefit short-term analysis that
 
04:25:09.950 --> 04:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
that you know we can't even bring
 
04:25:12.110 --> 04:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves to fund three positions in the
 
04:25:14.929 --> 04:25:14.939 align:start position:0%
department of of uh of energy to oversee
 
04:25:17.630 --> 04:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
people who would drop a plan I mean it's
 
04:25:19.429 --> 04:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
it's just a little bit out of touch so I
 
04:25:20.710 --> 04:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
feel that
 
04:25:23.150 --> 04:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
we need to do something we need to do
 
04:25:23.160 --> 04:25:25.550 align:start position:0%
we need to do something we need to do
better

04:25:25.550 --> 04:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.630 --> 04:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:32.090 --> 04:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
seeing none I asked the clerk to call
 
04:25:34.189 --> 04:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
the role on the question of itl for
 
04:25:39.410 --> 04:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%

04:29:12.290 --> 04:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
it's likely that having voted
 
04:29:15.290 --> 04:29:15.300 align:start position:0%
10 10 on the two previous motions that
 
04:29:18.469 --> 04:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
this motion will also come out as 10 10.
 
04:29:20.510 --> 04:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
and if that should be the case this bill
 
04:29:21.889 --> 04:29:21.899 align:start position:0%

04:30:52.910 --> 04:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
to 10 this bill is voted uh or the
 
04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
committee has voted not to retain this
 
04:30:55.910 --> 04:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
bill therefore it will go to the house
 
04:30:58.910 --> 04:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
floor without recommendation
 
04:31:01.550 --> 04:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
so I'll close the exact session on House
 
04:31:05.450 --> 04:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:07.849 --> 04:31:07.859 align:start position:0%
now I want to clarify for everyone's
 
04:31:10.729 --> 04:31:10.739 align:start position:0%
edification here that
 
04:31:14.689 --> 04:31:14.699 align:start position:0%
I was chastised by the house Clerk last
 
04:31:18.469 --> 04:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
week or shortcutting the executive
 
04:31:21.110 --> 04:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
session process it was explained to me
 
04:31:25.250 --> 04:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
that if a motion fails 10 to 10 then you
 
04:31:27.769 --> 04:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
have to go to the next motion if that
 
04:31:30.349 --> 04:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
fails 10 to 10 then you have to go to
 
04:31:33.110 --> 04:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
retain it's required and then if that
 
04:31:35.510 --> 04:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
motion fails then the bill can come out
 
04:31:37.130 --> 04:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
of committee without a without
 
04:31:39.110 --> 04:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation so that's why we had
 
04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
three separate votes on this bill
 
04:31:45.110 --> 04:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's to keep me in the good graces of
 
04:31:47.450 --> 04:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
the house Clerk
 
04:31:51.530 --> 04:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
okay I may add that if we do this over
 
04:31:53.090 --> 04:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
and over again I'm going to run out of
 
04:31:55.670 --> 04:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
roll calls
 
04:31:55.680 --> 04:31:56.929 align:start position:0%
roll calls
okay

04:31:56.929 --> 04:31:56.939 align:start position:0%

04:31:56.939 --> 04:31:59.050 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:31:59.050 --> 04:31:59.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:02.630 --> 04:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
Christy is uh
 
04:32:05.149 --> 04:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
Carey's still here
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
could you tell her we might need some
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative McWilliams
 
04:32:17.689 --> 04:32:17.699 align:start position:0%
in the interest of Expedia
 
04:32:19.429 --> 04:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate what you were doing and
 
04:32:19.439 --> 04:32:20.990 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate what you were doing and
our

04:32:20.990 --> 04:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:32:22.490 --> 04:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
saying you would assume that the vote
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
would be the same whether it was OTP itl
 
04:32:27.769 --> 04:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
retain is there a way that we can sort
 
04:32:29.630 --> 04:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
of fast-track this and not spend the
 
04:32:31.790 --> 04:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
extra seven minutes doing three votes
 
04:32:34.910 --> 04:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
did the CH did the clerk give you any
 
04:32:38.469 --> 04:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
best practices on this baby
 
04:32:41.330 --> 04:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative uh he did not he he said
 
04:32:43.370 --> 04:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
we have to go through the process he
 
04:32:43.380 --> 04:32:44.570 align:start position:0%
we have to go through the process he
said

04:32:44.570 --> 04:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:32:47.090 --> 04:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
let's say you vote itl first and it
 
04:32:49.550 --> 04:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
comes out 10 10. he said you can't skip
 
04:32:51.410 --> 04:32:51.420 align:start position:0%
the vote on OTP because somebody might
 
04:32:53.450 --> 04:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
change their mind
 
04:32:55.790 --> 04:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
so you have to take the vote
 
04:32:59.110 --> 04:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
and the ditto with retain
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
somebody may change their vote and say
 
04:33:03.349 --> 04:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
yeah let's keep this bill and look at it
 
04:33:05.269 --> 04:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
again so you have to go through the
 
04:33:07.310 --> 04:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
process all three steps
 
04:33:09.051 --> 04:33:09.061 align:start position:0%
that's the way it was explained to me
 
04:33:11.689 --> 04:33:11.699 align:start position:0%
anyway representative Doug Thomas yes Mr
 
04:33:14.510 --> 04:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh is it possible that we could
 
04:33:17.869 --> 04:33:17.879 align:start position:0%
either do a either a Voice vote I'm
 
04:33:20.689 --> 04:33:20.699 align:start position:0%
sorry maybe a hand vote to expediate the
 
04:33:20.699 --> 04:33:22.689 align:start position:0%
sorry maybe a hand vote to expediate the
process

04:33:22.689 --> 04:33:22.699 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:33:25.070 --> 04:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
I'll defer to the clerk on this one
 
04:33:28.970 --> 04:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
during clerk training did they uh not a
 
04:33:32.150 --> 04:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittees but not for uh that's what
 
04:33:34.010 --> 04:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
I thought yeah yeah that's not allowable
 
04:33:37.010 --> 04:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
for full committee uh executive session
 
04:33:41.390 --> 04:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
votes so sorry good try
 
04:33:42.650 --> 04:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:33:45.769 --> 04:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
with that clarification uh
 
04:33:47.869 --> 04:33:47.879 align:start position:0%
explained so that everybody knows what
 
04:33:49.970 --> 04:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
we're doing we will move on
 
04:33:53.330 --> 04:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
and I will now resume the public hearing

as we speak or as I speak
 
04:35:02.330 --> 04:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is it
 
04:35:05.869 --> 04:35:05.879 align:start position:0%
removes from the original bill
 
04:35:09.709 --> 04:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
information uh or a requirement to adopt
 
04:35:14.570 --> 04:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:14.580 --> 04:35:16.189 align:start position:0%
 
for

04:35:16.189 --> 04:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
a application to or modification
 
04:35:22.310 --> 04:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
application for wireless service
 
04:35:22.320 --> 04:35:23.929 align:start position:0%
application for wireless service
facilities

04:35:23.929 --> 04:35:23.939 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
it also makes some changes to language
 
04:35:28.490 --> 04:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
down in section two
 
04:35:31.010 --> 04:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
it removes the word environmental from
 
04:35:33.349 --> 04:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
line 20.
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
and it changes in line 24
 
04:35:42.670 --> 04:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
a phrase that previously read
 
04:35:45.051 --> 04:35:45.061 align:start position:0%
environmentally sensitive areas it
 
04:35:47.709 --> 04:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
changed that phrase to horticulturally
 
04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
sensitive areas
 
04:35:54.289 --> 04:35:54.299 align:start position:0%
so that those are the substantive parts
 
04:35:55.849 --> 04:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
of this
 
04:35:57.890 --> 04:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
Amendment those are all the parts of the
 
04:36:00.590 --> 04:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
amendment actually and uh
 
04:36:04.131 --> 04:36:04.141 align:start position:0%
I offer this for adoption and would like
 
04:36:06.949 --> 04:36:06.959 align:start position:0%
to hear your comments on the amendment
 
04:36:09.709 --> 04:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
04:36:10.910 --> 04:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you chair votes for the
 
04:36:12.289 --> 04:36:12.299 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill
 
04:36:13.849 --> 04:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
um I know we've talked about the fact
 
04:36:15.490 --> 04:36:15.500 align:start position:0%
that I have a background as an attorney
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
and so reading this with sort of a legal
 
04:36:20.510 --> 04:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
lens I am really happy to see the change
 
04:36:23.570 --> 04:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
specifically to line 24 to Define
 
04:36:26.150 --> 04:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
historical or horticulturally sensitive
 
04:36:27.590 --> 04:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
areas I do believe that that is
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
something a court of law could hold up
 
04:36:30.470 --> 04:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
if there were a challenge about the
 
04:36:33.410 --> 04:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
location of a 5G cell tower I was
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
concerned that environmental concerns
 
04:36:37.310 --> 04:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
was just too wide-ranging for a court to
 
04:36:38.990 --> 04:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
interpret and it may be stricken from
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
the uh from the statute and so therefore
 
04:36:43.310 --> 04:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
I'm very happy with this amendment thank
 
04:36:43.320 --> 04:36:44.869 align:start position:0%
I'm very happy with this amendment thank
you

04:36:44.869 --> 04:36:44.879 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:36:48.890 --> 04:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:51.289 --> 04:36:51.299 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
04:36:51.299 --> 04:36:52.429 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
chair

04:36:52.429 --> 04:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:36:54.289 --> 04:36:54.299 align:start position:0%
um I'm not trying to nitpick here I'm
 
04:36:55.490 --> 04:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
just trying to
 
04:36:57.590 --> 04:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
um see what's what's in this amendment
 
04:36:59.750 --> 04:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
on line 24
 
04:37:02.750 --> 04:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
um it's his horticulturally
 
04:37:04.970 --> 04:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
sensitive areas but there's no hyphen so
 
04:37:07.510 --> 04:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
is it historical sensitive as well as
 
04:37:10.570 --> 04:37:10.580 align:start position:0%
horticulturally sensitive or is it just
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:18.051 --> 04:37:18.061 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry I was distracted you're
 
04:37:19.551 --> 04:37:19.561 align:start position:0%
complaining about the no I'm not
 
04:37:20.631 --> 04:37:20.641 align:start position:0%
complaining I'm just asking a
 
04:37:23.269 --> 04:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
clarification question so in the
 
04:37:24.830 --> 04:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
original bill it was environmentally
 
04:37:27.051 --> 04:37:27.061 align:start position:0%
hyphen sensitive areas but in this one
 
04:37:29.449 --> 04:37:29.459 align:start position:0%
there's no hyphen so is it historical
 
04:37:32.510 --> 04:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
sensitive as well as Horticultural Lee
 
04:37:32.520 --> 04:37:33.890 align:start position:0%
sensitive as well as Horticultural Lee
sensitive

04:37:33.890 --> 04:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
sensitive
 
04:37:36.349 --> 04:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
or is it horticulturally sensitive and
 
04:37:36.359 --> 04:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
or is it horticulturally sensitive and
historical

04:37:37.910 --> 04:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
historical
 
04:37:40.849 --> 04:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
I I asked the OLS attorney to put a
 
04:37:43.390 --> 04:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
hyphen in there he did not
 
04:37:46.970 --> 04:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
so all right so the sensitive just
 
04:37:49.369 --> 04:37:49.379 align:start position:0%
belongs to the Horticultural yes thank
 
04:37:51.289 --> 04:37:51.299 align:start position:0%
you okay okay
 
04:37:53.869 --> 04:37:53.879 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you um I
 
04:37:55.429 --> 04:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
actually directed The Dartmouth College
 
04:37:57.349 --> 04:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
writing program so I'm very sensitive to
 
04:38:00.410 --> 04:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
these issues because horticulturally is
 
04:38:02.929 --> 04:38:02.939 align:start position:0%
no pun intended right
 
04:38:05.689 --> 04:38:05.699 align:start position:0%
because horticulturally is an adverb it
 
04:38:08.929 --> 04:38:08.939 align:start position:0%
cannot apply to areas so it applies only
 
04:38:12.830 --> 04:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
to sensitive and therefore historical uh
 
04:38:15.890 --> 04:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
does not so it's it's historical areas
 
04:38:18.289 --> 04:38:18.299 align:start position:0%
or horticulturally sensitive areas
 
04:38:20.810 --> 04:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
that's the correct interpretation
 
04:38:23.330 --> 04:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
so you're saying the OLS attorney did it
 
04:38:25.730 --> 04:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
correctly I am saying just that yes oh
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
excellent so excuse me are you saying
 
04:38:29.390 --> 04:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
they did it wrong in the first bill
 
04:38:33.551 --> 04:38:33.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's a tiny little thing but good
 
04:38:38.510 --> 04:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
enough that's settled that settled any
 
04:38:41.631 --> 04:38:41.641 align:start position:0%
further comment representative muns
 
04:38:43.369 --> 04:38:43.379 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:38:46.010 --> 04:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
um I noticed that your um Amendment also
 
04:38:49.131 --> 04:38:49.141 align:start position:0%
deleted deletes the second paragraph of
 
04:38:50.449 --> 04:38:50.459 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
that was dealing I think with
 
04:38:56.090 --> 04:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
um indemnification
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:05.631 --> 04:39:05.641 align:start position:0%
yes I deleted everything after the
 
04:39:07.970 --> 04:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
uh the word
 
04:39:09.769 --> 04:39:09.779 align:start position:0%
or the words building electrical and
 
04:39:12.289 --> 04:39:12.299 align:start position:0%
fire codes
 
04:39:15.849 --> 04:39:15.859 align:start position:0%
because I they applied to the previous
 
04:39:20.631 --> 04:39:20.641 align:start position:0%
or to the ANSI Adco or APCO whatever it
 
04:39:25.250 --> 04:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
was a section of the of the bill follow
 
04:39:28.609 --> 04:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
up on that that I apologize that's what
 
04:39:30.410 --> 04:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
I wasn't I wasn't referring to that in
 
04:39:33.170 --> 04:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
in the original Bill there is actually a
 
04:39:35.209 --> 04:39:35.219 align:start position:0%
second paragraph a paragraph that comes
 
04:39:37.730 --> 04:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
after the discussion of historical or
 
04:39:40.490 --> 04:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
environmentally sensitive areas it talks
 
04:39:42.350 --> 04:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
about adding a
 
04:39:46.430 --> 04:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
a sub paragraph to deal with
 
04:39:46.440 --> 04:39:47.630 align:start position:0%
a sub paragraph to deal with
um

04:39:47.630 --> 04:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:51.110 --> 04:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
a you know planning board can add um you
 
04:39:52.490 --> 04:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
know I can just re I can read it if you
 
04:39:54.050 --> 04:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
want me to no you don't need to because
 
04:39:55.788 --> 04:39:55.798 align:start position:0%
now I understand your question yeah I
 
04:39:58.610 --> 04:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
just was curious as to you know yeah the
 
04:40:00.530 --> 04:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is if you read
 
04:40:03.708 --> 04:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
line one of the amendment it says amend
 
04:40:06.770 --> 04:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
the bill by replacing section one with
 
04:40:10.010 --> 04:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
the following so this just
 
04:40:12.410 --> 04:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
replaces section one but section two
 
04:40:15.948 --> 04:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
remains intact thank you very much okay
 
04:40:17.868 --> 04:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion on this
 
04:40:20.448 --> 04:40:20.458 align:start position:0%
amendment representative partial
 
04:40:22.670 --> 04:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair I need to just add
 
04:40:24.590 --> 04:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
one correction of some information I
 
04:40:26.570 --> 04:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
supplied to Doug Thomas yesterday
 
04:40:29.448 --> 04:40:29.458 align:start position:0%
I believe I stated incorrectly that this
 
04:40:31.788 --> 04:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
thus applies to the
 
04:40:34.550 --> 04:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
short range what is a small repeater
 
04:40:37.550 --> 04:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
small so so
 
04:40:39.410 --> 04:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh 5G
 
04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
in fact this legislation will also apply
 
04:40:44.330 --> 04:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
to macro Towers
 
04:40:46.490 --> 04:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
and so the removal of that one Clause
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
may be of questionable nature but I will
 
04:40:52.010 --> 04:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
not contest it right now
 
04:40:55.010 --> 04:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much any further
 
04:40:55.020 --> 04:40:58.070 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much any further
discussion

04:40:58.070 --> 04:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:00.110 --> 04:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
04:41:02.810 --> 04:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
the roll on the question of adopting the
 
04:41:02.820 --> 04:41:03.770 align:start position:0%
the roll on the question of adopting the
amendment

04:41:03.770 --> 04:41:03.780 align:start position:0%

the committee to Bear Indulgence to my
 
04:42:33.288 --> 04:42:33.298 align:start position:0%
to me for a second I I'm
 
04:42:36.050 --> 04:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
I have been struggling with why this
 
04:42:39.470 --> 04:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is even necessary
 
04:42:43.970 --> 04:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
um I I heard during testimony and I've
 
04:42:46.610 --> 04:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
heard in conversations that I've been
 
04:42:49.788 --> 04:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
part of that this is required this is
 
04:42:53.288 --> 04:42:53.298 align:start position:0%
something that will give local
 
04:42:53.298 --> 04:42:54.910 align:start position:0%
something that will give local
authorities

04:42:54.910 --> 04:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
04:42:58.570 --> 04:42:58.580 align:start position:0%
the ability to have greater oversight
 
04:43:03.410 --> 04:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
over the placement of 5G
 
04:43:03.420 --> 04:43:04.430 align:start position:0%
over the placement of 5G
um

04:43:04.430 --> 04:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:07.610 --> 04:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh transmitters in in the community but
 
04:43:09.350 --> 04:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
I've also heard that the local
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
authorities already have that Authority
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
and I've heard also that there's
 
04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
extensive regulations that the FCC has
 
04:43:20.330 --> 04:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
that governs where
 
04:43:22.910 --> 04:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
um these transmitters can be placed so
 
04:43:22.920 --> 04:43:23.868 align:start position:0%
um these transmitters can be placed so
I'm

04:43:23.868 --> 04:43:23.878 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
04:43:26.810 --> 04:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
and I'm just asking I'm asking anyone on
 
04:43:28.430 --> 04:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
the committee that could maybe enlighten
 
04:43:28.440 --> 04:43:29.330 align:start position:0%
the committee that could maybe enlighten
me

04:43:29.330 --> 04:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
um you know what Gap is this bill going
 
04:43:41.948 --> 04:43:41.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:44.930 --> 04:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
uh representative partial
 
04:43:48.230 --> 04:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
as I have already done uh what I believe
 
04:43:51.170 --> 04:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
was my best ability to explain where I
 
04:43:52.250 --> 04:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
see the gap
 
04:43:54.948 --> 04:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
would it be possible for me to call back
 
04:43:57.170 --> 04:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
to the witness stand somebody to uh
 
04:43:58.670 --> 04:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
maybe do a better job than I could have
 
04:44:00.788 --> 04:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
explaining it
 
04:44:03.708 --> 04:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
no we're in voting mode at this point so
 
04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
that that won't work sorry
 
04:44:10.270 --> 04:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
any uh further discussion
 
04:44:12.890 --> 04:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds will turn off
 
04:44:14.330 --> 04:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
your microphone and representative
 
04:44:16.970 --> 04:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
closures recognized
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair if I believe
 
04:44:22.730 --> 04:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
correctly the municipalities did not
 
04:44:25.368 --> 04:44:25.378 align:start position:0%
have anything in writing
 
04:44:27.770 --> 04:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
that they felt comfortable with to
 
04:44:27.780 --> 04:44:29.510 align:start position:0%
that they felt comfortable with to
challenge

04:44:29.510 --> 04:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
04:44:29.520 --> 04:44:32.410 align:start position:0%
challenge
the

04:44:32.410 --> 04:44:32.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:44:35.690 --> 04:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
Communications definition of
 
04:44:39.470 --> 04:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
the Federal's rulings
 
04:44:42.230 --> 04:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
it did not I believe it did not say now
 
04:44:44.270 --> 04:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
someone needs to correct me I did not
 
04:44:46.190 --> 04:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
have this in my minutes
 
04:44:48.590 --> 04:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
but I believe
 
04:44:50.090 --> 04:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
here we go I'm not supposed to believe
 
04:44:53.390 --> 04:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:58.010 --> 04:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:00.410 --> 04:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
um a statue
 
04:45:04.430 --> 04:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
to tell them they actually have
 
04:45:07.490 --> 04:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
the authority to look into this with
 
04:45:09.948 --> 04:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
engineering of their own I don't believe
 
04:45:13.910 --> 04:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
that was out there that's why this bill
 
04:45:16.670 --> 04:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further discussion on the
 
04:45:20.288 --> 04:45:20.298 align:start position:0%
question of otpa on House Bill 298
 
04:45:23.090 --> 04:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
representative notter
 
04:45:25.128 --> 04:45:25.138 align:start position:0%
I still have a lot of reservations about
 
04:45:27.948 --> 04:45:27.958 align:start position:0%
this bill and I've got a whole list of
 
04:45:30.288 --> 04:45:30.298 align:start position:0%
questions and it would just it would
 
04:45:33.288 --> 04:45:33.298 align:start position:0%
just take a long time can I hand this to
 
04:45:35.628 --> 04:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
you and let you look it over for a few
 
04:45:35.638 --> 04:45:37.490 align:start position:0%
you and let you look it over for a few
minutes

04:45:37.490 --> 04:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
04:45:39.530 --> 04:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
I don't have time to look it over I can
 
04:45:42.670 --> 04:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
look it over later if you like but
 
04:45:44.868 --> 04:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
representative Corman had a question or
 
04:45:47.510 --> 04:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
a comment yes thank you Mr chair uh just
 
04:45:50.150 --> 04:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
to follow up on on representative munz's
 
04:45:51.890 --> 04:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking through my notes
 
04:45:54.770 --> 04:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
and um the first person the person who
 
04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill was Senator richardi
 
04:45:59.990 --> 04:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
and representative Doug Thomas did ask a
 
04:46:02.750 --> 04:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
question about uh what this bill did in
 
04:46:06.170 --> 04:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
terms of municipalities and Senator
 
04:46:08.750 --> 04:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
richardi did say that it gives Clarity
 
04:46:11.208 --> 04:46:11.218 align:start position:0%
to municipalities that are currently
 
04:46:12.948 --> 04:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
confused because of what they hear from
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
industry telling them that they they
 
04:46:18.288 --> 04:46:18.298 align:start position:0%
don't have any jurisdiction so if
 
04:46:20.208 --> 04:46:20.218 align:start position:0%
nothing else this bill would help
 
04:46:23.150 --> 04:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
clarify to municipalities what their
 
04:46:25.930 --> 04:46:25.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:30.530 --> 04:46:30.540 align:start position:0%

by a vote of 10 to 10 the motion to

otpa fails
 
04:48:10.670 --> 04:48:10.680 align:start position:0%

04:48:13.190 --> 04:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
Thomas for a motion
 
04:48:17.090 --> 04:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair motion itl
 
04:48:20.868 --> 04:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Bernardi
 
04:48:23.090 --> 04:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
the second the motion it's been moved
 
04:48:26.930 --> 04:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
and seconded that we itl House Bill 298
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:33.470 --> 04:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative barajny
 
04:48:35.448 --> 04:48:35.458 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman this is more of a
 
04:48:37.490 --> 04:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
question uh based on the previous
 
04:48:40.250 --> 04:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
questions but the FCC does not there's
 
04:48:42.350 --> 04:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
not a lot of time to just forbid putting
 
04:48:45.230 --> 04:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
Towers in their town so if you have if
 
04:48:48.610 --> 04:48:48.620 align:start position:0%
you're required to have a tower
 
04:48:51.770 --> 04:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
anyways this seems like this just adds a
 
04:48:53.868 --> 04:48:53.878 align:start position:0%
roadblock but they have to allow a tower
 
04:48:56.810 --> 04:48:56.820 align:start position:0%
to be built somewhere in town I guess if
 
04:48:58.550 --> 04:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
anybody has a comment on that or if they
 
04:49:01.070 --> 04:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
remember that from the testimony
 
04:49:04.670 --> 04:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:06.770 --> 04:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative muns
 
04:49:10.430 --> 04:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just um wanted to
 
04:49:13.310 --> 04:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
take this opportunity to just say that
 
04:49:15.830 --> 04:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
um my opposition to this bill is I'm
 
04:49:18.288 --> 04:49:18.298 align:start position:0%
very sympathetic to those that are
 
04:49:21.650 --> 04:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
concerned about the um the placement of
 
04:49:23.930 --> 04:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
these Wireless transmitters I I think
 
04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's a legitimate concern and my vote
 
04:49:30.050 --> 04:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
against adoption was based more on just
 
04:49:32.270 --> 04:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
lack of clarity about what this was
 
04:49:34.430 --> 04:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
really going to be doing in terms of uh
 
04:49:37.070 --> 04:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
making it making it making that process
 
04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
more seamless
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McWilliams
 
04:49:44.150 --> 04:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you charvos as a representative
 
04:49:47.030 --> 04:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
who has a constituent Who currently does
 
04:49:49.070 --> 04:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
not want a tower anywhere near his
 
04:49:51.110 --> 04:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
agricultural field because there is
 
04:49:53.150 --> 04:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
research coming out of unh Durham
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
regarding impacts on certain crops from
 
04:49:59.690 --> 04:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
the wireless signals I certainly would
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
like to have something in statute that
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
he would be able to stand on in his
 
04:50:05.570 --> 04:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
attempts to fight the location of the
 
04:50:07.610 --> 04:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
tower near his field and so for that
 
04:50:09.050 --> 04:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
reason I really feel like we need to
 
04:50:10.670 --> 04:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
have something that our constituents can
 
04:50:12.230 --> 04:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
lean on if they're going to be able to
 
04:50:17.690 --> 04:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:19.730 --> 04:50:19.740 align:start position:0%

similar but but on the topic of 5G Tower

amendment that we can't seem to agree on
 
04:52:27.470 --> 04:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that retaining would have a
 
04:52:27.480 --> 04:52:30.590 align:start position:0%

purpose

04:52:30.590 --> 04:52:30.600 align:start position:0%

04:55:03.230 --> 04:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:55:07.850 --> 04:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
zero five seven six H which is
 
04:55:07.860 --> 04:55:09.350 align:start position:0%
zero five seven six H which is
circulating

04:55:09.350 --> 04:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
circulating
 
04:55:13.010 --> 04:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
to each of you as I speak
 
04:55:15.190 --> 04:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
04:55:17.628 --> 04:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
implements the recommendation of the
 
04:55:22.850 --> 04:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:24.948 --> 04:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
to put into statute
 
04:55:28.128 --> 04:55:28.138 align:start position:0%
a bifurcation of large
 
04:55:32.448 --> 04:55:32.458 align:start position:0%
systems and small thermal systems
 
04:55:34.250 --> 04:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
and further
 
04:55:38.990 --> 04:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
makes those small systems
 
04:55:42.788 --> 04:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive thermal wrecks
 
04:55:46.430 --> 04:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
without having to
 
04:55:49.070 --> 04:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
use a meter to determine their
 
04:55:49.080 --> 04:55:50.750 align:start position:0%
use a meter to determine their
eligibility

04:55:50.750 --> 04:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
04:55:53.510 --> 04:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
their eligibility instead shall be
 
04:55:55.070 --> 04:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
verified by a method that is
 
04:55:56.770 --> 04:55:56.780 align:start position:0%
satisfactory to the Department of energy
 
04:55:59.150 --> 04:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
in order to calculate the quantity of
 
04:56:01.250 --> 04:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
megabot hours for which renewable energy
 
04:56:04.190 --> 04:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
certificates are qualified
 
04:56:06.910 --> 04:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
so this is a essentially the same bill
 
04:56:09.708 --> 04:56:09.718 align:start position:0%
only using different language and it's
 
04:56:11.390 --> 04:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
language that has been vetted by the
 
04:56:13.310 --> 04:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
department of energy and recommended by
 
04:56:15.830 --> 04:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
04:56:18.830 --> 04:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on the adoption
 
04:56:21.410 --> 04:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
of this amendment
 
04:56:23.208 --> 04:56:23.218 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas
 
04:56:25.490 --> 04:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh we heard
 
04:56:27.890 --> 04:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
testimony from several people and
 
04:56:30.830 --> 04:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
businesses in the wood industry in favor
 
04:56:33.948 --> 04:56:33.958 align:start position:0%
of this um Bill and this amendment just
 
04:56:38.810 --> 04:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
just makes it better we need to um
 
04:56:41.810 --> 04:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
offer some relief to our small business
 
04:56:43.670 --> 04:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
would people where these meters are very
 
04:56:46.190 --> 04:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
expensive and they do provide a service
 
04:56:49.070 --> 04:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
to our forests and to their uh to uh
 
04:56:51.230 --> 04:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
jobs as well I think this is a good
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment so I would recommend everyone
 
04:56:55.490 --> 04:56:55.500 align:start position:0%
support it please

representative Reynolds
 
04:57:03.350 --> 04:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I just would second uh what
 
04:57:05.270 --> 04:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas just said I I
 
04:57:08.090 --> 04:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
think it we ought to be encouraging and
 
04:57:10.310 --> 04:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
making it more possible for small
 
04:57:14.510 --> 04:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh small wood burners
 
04:57:17.030 --> 04:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
to capitalize on on the wrecks so I
 
04:57:20.030 --> 04:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
think this is a good Improvement
 
04:57:22.850 --> 04:57:22.860 align:start position:0%

04:57:22.860 --> 04:57:23.890 align:start position:0%

question

04:57:23.890 --> 04:57:23.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:57:26.208 --> 04:57:26.218 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
04:57:28.490 --> 04:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
the question does this get down to the
 
04:57:33.110 --> 04:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
level of potentially uh residential uh
 
04:57:35.930 --> 04:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
pellet burning or no yes those would
 
04:57:38.810 --> 04:57:38.820 align:start position:0%
qualify as small systems yes okay thank
 
04:57:41.510 --> 04:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
you I'd remind members that the purpose
 
04:57:43.670 --> 04:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
of this bill was to increase the number
 
04:57:46.250 --> 04:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
of T-Rex thermal wrecks that are
 
04:57:46.260 --> 04:57:47.448 align:start position:0%
of T-Rex thermal wrecks that are
available

04:57:47.448 --> 04:57:47.458 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:57:50.570 --> 04:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
for utilities to purchase so that they
 
04:57:52.310 --> 04:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
don't have to make alternative
 
04:57:54.770 --> 04:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
compliance payments instead
 
04:57:57.590 --> 04:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
acps are more expensive so if they can
 
04:58:00.530 --> 04:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
buy thermal Wrecks for less money it
 
04:58:02.410 --> 04:58:02.420 align:start position:0%
brings down the cost to ratepayers
 
04:58:04.490 --> 04:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter
 
04:58:06.830 --> 04:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman during the hearing
 
04:58:08.930 --> 04:58:08.940 align:start position:0%

04:58:11.288 --> 04:58:11.298 align:start position:0%
class of RPS and
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
the guy was was kind of taken aback by
 
04:58:16.070 --> 04:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
that question and I said well it's come
 
04:58:19.910 --> 04:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
up before in in committee and I just
 
04:58:21.230 --> 04:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
thought it was interesting that I found
 
04:58:22.788 --> 04:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
a note in my notebook from I don't even
 
04:58:24.590 --> 04:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
know how many terms ago where we did
 
04:58:27.110 --> 04:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
discuss classless RPS so I just wanted
 
04:58:30.650 --> 04:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:33.170 --> 04:58:33.180 align:start position:0%

05:00:42.110 --> 05:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative Krishan sorry that this
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
is a question
 
05:00:44.448 --> 05:00:44.458 align:start position:0%
um since I wasn't here for the
 
05:00:44.458 --> 05:00:45.590 align:start position:0%
um since I wasn't here for the
discussion

05:00:45.590 --> 05:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
05:00:48.590 --> 05:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
um is there a concern that creating more
 
05:00:50.990 --> 05:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
T-Rex without making some sort of
 
05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
commensurate change to the RPS standards
 
05:00:56.270 --> 05:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
05:01:00.170 --> 05:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
either flood the uh Market with Rex and
 
05:01:02.570 --> 05:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
make them each less expensive or
 
05:01:05.448 --> 05:01:05.458 align:start position:0%
generally depress the
 
05:01:08.690 --> 05:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
to press the market for for wrecks and
 
05:01:08.700 --> 05:01:09.470 align:start position:0%
to press the market for for wrecks and
um

05:01:09.470 --> 05:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:11.390 --> 05:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
discourage investment in other renewable
 
05:01:11.400 --> 05:01:13.010 align:start position:0%
discourage investment in other renewable
sources

05:01:13.010 --> 05:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
sources
 
05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
no there was no concern about that at
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
all in fact there's a shortage of T-Rex
 
05:01:20.208 --> 05:01:20.218 align:start position:0%
right now and last year the utilities
 
05:01:23.030 --> 05:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
made 2.8 million dollars of ACP payments
 
05:01:24.948 --> 05:01:24.958 align:start position:0%
because they couldn't find T-rex to buy
 
05:01:27.530 --> 05:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
so there's was no concern expressed
 
05:01:30.708 --> 05:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
about t-rex suddenly flooding the market
 
05:01:33.230 --> 05:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
and bringing down the cost of other
 
05:01:33.240 --> 05:01:35.208 align:start position:0%
and bringing down the cost of other
wrecks

05:01:35.208 --> 05:01:35.218 align:start position:0%
wrecks
 
05:01:38.750 --> 05:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:40.550 --> 05:01:40.560 align:start position:0%

05:02:42.948 --> 05:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
by a vote of 19-1 the committee judges
 
05:02:48.410 --> 05:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
house bill 233 to be worthy of OTP a
 
05:02:48.420 --> 05:02:49.850 align:start position:0%
house bill 233 to be worthy of OTP a
and

05:02:49.850 --> 05:02:49.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:02:54.708 --> 05:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
because this is a dash FN bill
 
05:02:56.930 --> 05:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
I think it cannot go on the consent
 
05:02:56.940 --> 05:02:58.010 align:start position:0%
I think it cannot go on the consent
calendar

05:02:58.010 --> 05:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
05:03:00.470 --> 05:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately correct
 
05:03:00.480 --> 05:03:01.730 align:start position:0%
unfortunately correct
okay

05:03:01.730 --> 05:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:03:04.430 --> 05:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
so that will conclude the exact session
 
05:03:08.150 --> 05:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 2 33.
 
05:03:10.310 --> 05:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
so we haven't been identified who's
 
05:03:13.250 --> 05:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
going to be writing the reports we want
 
05:03:15.250 --> 05:03:15.260 align:start position:0%
to do that at the end
 
05:03:17.690 --> 05:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
the clerk reminds me that we need to
 
05:03:19.128 --> 05:03:19.138 align:start position:0%
identify who's going to be writing
 
05:03:19.138 --> 05:03:20.448 align:start position:0%
identify who's going to be writing
reports

05:03:20.448 --> 05:03:20.458 align:start position:0%
reports
 
05:03:20.458 --> 05:03:22.070 align:start position:0%
reports
so

05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:03:26.208 --> 05:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
on this bill I will write the report for
 
05:03:26.218 --> 05:03:28.030 align:start position:0%
on this bill I will write the report for
otpa

05:03:28.030 --> 05:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
otpa
 
05:03:30.288 --> 05:03:30.298 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams will there be
 
05:03:34.490 --> 05:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
no Minority Report on this bill all
 
05:03:38.628 --> 05:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
right let's backtrack and do the bills
 
05:03:41.770 --> 05:03:41.780 align:start position:0%
that we did before House Bill
 
05:03:45.350 --> 05:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
208 who will write the OTP
 
05:03:48.590 --> 05:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation on that one
 
05:03:48.600 --> 05:03:53.990 align:start position:0%
recommendation on that one
application

05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:55.670 --> 05:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
otpa yes
 
05:04:00.288 --> 05:04:00.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:02.868 --> 05:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
and will there be a Minority Report well
 
05:04:05.510 --> 05:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
there has to be because it was 298 or
 
05:04:09.650 --> 05:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
208. 208. did I say 98 I misspoke I'm

port report for
 
05:04:24.480 --> 05:04:29.090 align:start position:0%
port report for
OTP

05:04:29.090 --> 05:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:32.030 --> 05:04:32.040 align:start position:0%

Lucius partial we'll write the
 
05:04:45.770 --> 05:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
OTP position yes
 
05:04:45.780 --> 05:04:48.230 align:start position:0%
OTP position yes
and

05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas will write
 
05:04:50.400 --> 05:04:51.288 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas will write
the

05:04:51.288 --> 05:04:51.298 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:04:58.910 --> 05:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:58.920 --> 05:05:02.690 align:start position:0%

05:07:10.250 --> 05:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
so we won't close that executive session
 
05:07:14.208 --> 05:07:14.218 align:start position:0%
because it's simply recessed
 
05:07:16.310 --> 05:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
but we're done with it for now
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%

05:07:45.530 --> 05:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
judge House Bill 251 to be worthy of
 
05:07:47.448 --> 05:07:47.458 align:start position:0%
ought to pass is there any discussion
 
05:07:50.030 --> 05:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas yes thank you Mr
 
05:07:54.170 --> 05:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
chair I offer Amendment
 
05:07:56.868 --> 05:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh put some of the Amendments here I
 
05:08:02.530 --> 05:08:02.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:06.670 --> 05:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
and the amendment basically
 
05:08:10.010 --> 05:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
adds one more requirement to what is
 
05:08:13.490 --> 05:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
already on the December
 
05:08:16.430 --> 05:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
um electric bills for utilities across
 
05:08:19.550 --> 05:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
the state which is to it it adds the
 
05:08:22.128 --> 05:08:22.138 align:start position:0%
dollar figure of the
 
05:08:24.770 --> 05:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
say this right the dollar figure of the
 
05:08:29.690 --> 05:08:29.700 align:start position:0%
average cost of RPS uh throughout the
 
05:08:33.350 --> 05:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
state so on your electric bill you will
 
05:08:36.288 --> 05:08:36.298 align:start position:0%
have somewhere on there will have not
 
05:08:40.310 --> 05:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
only your kilowatt basis for the RPS uh
 
05:08:43.550 --> 05:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
annualized as a estimate of the of the
 
05:08:46.128 --> 05:08:46.138 align:start position:0%
average but you'll also have the dollar
 
05:08:49.490 --> 05:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
figure of what it represents
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
um if I may uh should I just read the
 
05:08:55.128 --> 05:08:55.138 align:start position:0%
appropriate line that changes this
 
05:08:59.570 --> 05:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh yeah this was um this amendment was
 
05:09:02.090 --> 05:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
um written to and agreed to by members
 
05:09:06.288 --> 05:09:06.298 align:start position:0%
of doe and all four utilities and I'll
 
05:09:08.930 --> 05:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
just read the Salient point on lines 13
 
05:09:12.708 --> 05:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
to 17 where it says this was added to
 
05:09:16.850 --> 05:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
the to the bill utilities shall also be
 
05:09:19.970 --> 05:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
required to include an annual estimated
 
05:09:23.390 --> 05:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
cost to be calculated by multiplying the
 
05:09:26.270 --> 05:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
average per kilowatt hour cost of the
 
05:09:28.550 --> 05:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
electric renewable portfolio standard
 
05:09:32.990 --> 05:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
under RSA 362f for the prior compliance
 
05:09:35.990 --> 05:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
Year by the average residential monthly
 
05:09:40.550 --> 05:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
consumption of 225 kilowatt hours so I
 
05:09:42.050 --> 05:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
think during
 
05:09:44.930 --> 05:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
during testimony it was it was stated
 
05:09:47.868 --> 05:09:47.878 align:start position:0%
that approximately uh for I think was
 
05:09:51.410 --> 05:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
for 625 kilowatt hours the annual cost
 
05:09:54.230 --> 05:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
the average cost was around 39 dollars
 
05:09:57.770 --> 05:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
so if someone uses a thousand kilowatt
 
05:10:00.948 --> 05:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
hours for uh um or if someone can just
 
05:10:03.288 --> 05:10:03.298 align:start position:0%
take that figure and multiply their
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
their uh their monthly bills they can
 
05:10:07.788 --> 05:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
come up with their with their total cost
 
05:10:09.770 --> 05:10:09.780 align:start position:0%
for their particular bill but at least
 
05:10:11.810 --> 05:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
this gives them a basis to average by
 
05:10:14.090 --> 05:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
05:10:16.550 --> 05:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know and the important key
 
05:10:18.530 --> 05:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
question on this was answered the
 
05:10:20.570 --> 05:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
utility said that this would be done at
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
no additional cost to the repair
 
05:10:26.750 --> 05:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
so it's a win-win there
 
05:10:29.208 --> 05:10:29.218 align:start position:0%
did you pass out copies to all members
 
05:10:34.670 --> 05:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
no I well uh I think uh they were passed
 
05:10:36.288 --> 05:10:36.298 align:start position:0%
out plus I emailed them out to everybody
 
05:10:39.730 --> 05:10:39.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:39.740 --> 05:10:41.570 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:10:41.570 --> 05:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:10:45.530 --> 05:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
uh discussion on the amendment number
 
05:10:48.288 --> 05:10:48.298 align:start position:0%
zero five
 
05:10:51.350 --> 05:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
four eight H representative Wendy Thomas

don't have it in front of me
 
05:10:58.910 --> 05:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
um is it the same message on the bill
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
every month or is it just on the
 
05:11:02.990 --> 05:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
December bill you
 
05:11:04.610 --> 05:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it would be
 
05:11:06.170 --> 05:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
just for the December bill because it
 
05:11:08.868 --> 05:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
would show the the um the average the
 
05:11:11.448 --> 05:11:11.458 align:start position:0%
entire prior compliance year yeah thank
 
05:11:11.458 --> 05:11:13.610 align:start position:0%
entire prior compliance year yeah thank
you

05:11:13.610 --> 05:11:13.620 align:start position:0%

you Mr chair
 
05:11:20.878 --> 05:11:22.070 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair

um
 
05:11:23.868 --> 05:11:23.878 align:start position:0%
I I
 
05:11:26.030 --> 05:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
I'm struggling with the fact that we're
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing a calculation using an
 
05:11:31.368 --> 05:11:31.378 align:start position:0%
average number why can't we do the
 
05:11:33.948 --> 05:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
calculation using the actual consumption
 
05:11:37.010 --> 05:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
of the each individual customer
 
05:11:40.010 --> 05:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
well if I may answer uh
 
05:11:42.910 --> 05:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
that was the that was my original want
 
05:11:46.490 --> 05:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
three years ago uh but in discussion
 
05:11:50.170 --> 05:11:50.180 align:start position:0%
with the utilities uh I was informed
 
05:11:53.650 --> 05:11:53.660 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:11:56.810 --> 05:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
would actually cost money they would
 
05:11:57.948 --> 05:11:57.958 align:start position:0%
have to
 
05:12:00.708 --> 05:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
um revise some part of their software
 
05:12:03.708 --> 05:12:03.718 align:start position:0%
Billing System for each individualized
 
05:12:07.490 --> 05:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
electric bill and I think uh three or
 
05:12:09.050 --> 05:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
four years ago they were estimating it'd
 
05:12:11.150 --> 05:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
be about two million dollars this year
 
05:12:14.330 --> 05:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
is probably more with inflation but um
 
05:12:19.970 --> 05:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
we wanted something for for um
 
05:12:22.550 --> 05:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
to have people give some idea of what
 
05:12:23.628 --> 05:12:23.638 align:start position:0%
they might be paying if they were
 
05:12:24.770 --> 05:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
interested this gives a little bit
 
05:12:27.530 --> 05:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
easier so in the interest of a
 
05:12:29.570 --> 05:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
compromise we felt that having the
 
05:12:29.580 --> 05:12:31.030 align:start position:0%
compromise we felt that having the
annual

05:12:31.030 --> 05:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
annual
 
05:12:34.610 --> 05:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
number on here at least is another step
 
05:12:37.610 --> 05:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
towards the towards the purpose of
 
05:12:40.610 --> 05:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
transparency so but it was basically a a
 
05:12:42.288 --> 05:12:42.298 align:start position:0%
cost factor that would have been applied
 
05:12:46.250 --> 05:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
to the repairs follow up
 
05:12:49.128 --> 05:12:49.138 align:start position:0%
but it's misleading it it it's
 
05:12:51.550 --> 05:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
misleading unless unless somebody
 
05:12:55.788 --> 05:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
consumes 650 megawatt hours or 625
 
05:12:59.150 --> 05:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours it's not it's not doesn't
 
05:13:00.770 --> 05:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
say anything in terms of what their
 
05:13:02.990 --> 05:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
individual consumption is
 
05:13:05.150 --> 05:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
and what their what the what the cost is
 
05:13:06.890 --> 05:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
to them
 
05:13:09.530 --> 05:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
you're partially right there uh they
 
05:13:12.650 --> 05:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
would have to do a little bit of math to
 
05:13:14.990 --> 05:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
um to figure out what their actual
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
payment was but in my opinion and also
 
05:13:23.090 --> 05:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
in uh in talking to doe and also uh
 
05:13:25.490 --> 05:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
knowing uh members on the other side of
 
05:13:28.550 --> 05:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
the wall uh this is something this is a
 
05:13:31.670 --> 05:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
step that we can get done and it's just
 
05:13:34.010 --> 05:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
one more step and
 
05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
um to go further uh would probably
 
05:13:38.868 --> 05:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the entire bill so I would
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
rather have this one step done now and
 
05:13:45.830 --> 05:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
then maybe next year we can look at how
 
05:13:47.270 --> 05:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
we might be able to get a little more
 
05:13:47.280 --> 05:13:48.650 align:start position:0%
we might be able to get a little more
accurate

05:13:48.650 --> 05:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
05:13:50.570 --> 05:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
notion there but I think for right now
 
05:13:52.128 --> 05:13:52.138 align:start position:0%
this at least gives a little more
 
05:13:53.628 --> 05:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
information than just having cents per
 
05:13:56.868 --> 05:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours on there so that's I
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
think it's the best we can get right now
 
05:14:02.330 --> 05:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
and since this cents per kilowatt hour
 
05:14:05.030 --> 05:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
number is going to be printed on the
 
05:14:07.670 --> 05:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
bill any customer who cared could
 
05:14:10.550 --> 05:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
calculate out his actual usage for
 
05:14:10.560 --> 05:14:11.810 align:start position:0%
calculate out his actual usage for
himself

05:14:11.810 --> 05:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
himself
 
05:14:13.850 --> 05:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
representative munz
 
05:14:16.310 --> 05:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
I I agree with you completely so instead
 
05:14:18.110 --> 05:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
of putting a misleading number on why
 
05:14:19.670 --> 05:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
not just put a note on the bill that
 
05:14:22.490 --> 05:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
says to calculate your the annual cost
 
05:14:24.530 --> 05:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
of the renewable portfolio standard
 
05:14:27.650 --> 05:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
multiply this number by your your kwh
 
05:14:27.660 --> 05:14:29.510 align:start position:0%
multiply this number by your your kwh
usage

05:14:29.510 --> 05:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
usage
 
05:14:32.628 --> 05:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
I think the reason not to do that is
 
05:14:34.430 --> 05:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
because the vast majority of people just
 
05:14:37.310 --> 05:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't be bothered to do that but they
 
05:14:39.110 --> 05:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
might be interested to know that they're
 
05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
paying roughly 39 or whatever the number
 
05:14:45.650 --> 05:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
is every year for compliance with the
 
05:14:49.190 --> 05:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
RPS representative Thomas yes I actually
 
05:14:51.770 --> 05:14:51.780 align:start position:0%
asked that question and
 
05:14:54.410 --> 05:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of the billing systems software
 
05:14:58.010 --> 05:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
are decades old and they deal with
 
05:14:59.628 --> 05:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
limited characters
 
05:15:01.970 --> 05:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
and to increase the characters would
 
05:15:03.550 --> 05:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
increase expense
 
05:15:06.470 --> 05:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the truth that's the
 
05:15:10.490 --> 05:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:12.590 --> 05:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
additional comments representative
 
05:15:14.930 --> 05:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
Christian has a comment
 
05:15:17.628 --> 05:15:17.638 align:start position:0%
thank you um just wanted to agree with
 
05:15:19.610 --> 05:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
representative munz that I really don't
 
05:15:21.948 --> 05:15:21.958 align:start position:0%
see any value in providing an average
 
05:15:24.170 --> 05:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
that the customer would then have to
 
05:15:26.448 --> 05:15:26.458 align:start position:0%
back calculate from when it would be
 
05:15:28.730 --> 05:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
much simpler to Simply multiply by the
 
05:15:31.010 --> 05:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour rate that's already
 
05:15:31.020 --> 05:15:32.150 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour rate that's already
provided

05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
provided
 
05:15:34.368 --> 05:15:34.378 align:start position:0%
um but also I'm concerned that this
 
05:15:35.810 --> 05:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
amendment seems to be kind of
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
self-contradictory in a few areas
 
05:15:40.670 --> 05:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
um so it says you know the estimated
 
05:15:42.590 --> 05:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
cost for the compliance year shall be
 
05:15:45.170 --> 05:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
calculated once per year
 
05:15:47.990 --> 05:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
um that to me sounds like it applies to
 
05:15:51.650 --> 05:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
the actual customers cost not the the
 
05:15:53.750 --> 05:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
average there's also still language
 
05:15:55.550 --> 05:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
saying that the cost for a utility to
 
05:15:56.868 --> 05:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
provide this information will be
 
05:15:59.150 --> 05:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
recovered from Electric customers which
 
05:16:01.430 --> 05:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
I know we all are not interested in
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
adding to to and as representative
 
05:16:06.288 --> 05:16:06.298 align:start position:0%
Thomas said
 
05:16:06.298 --> 05:16:06.890 align:start position:0%
Thomas said
um

05:16:06.890 --> 05:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:08.690 --> 05:16:08.700 align:start position:0%
sounds like there shouldn't be any costs
 
05:16:10.368 --> 05:16:10.378 align:start position:0%
anyway so I'm not sure why that is still
 
05:16:11.510 --> 05:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
05:16:15.230 --> 05:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
well if if you notice that um the last
 
05:16:17.270 --> 05:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
part is not in bold so that's already
 
05:16:20.810 --> 05:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
part of the of the RSA so that wasn't
 
05:16:22.850 --> 05:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
changed at all it's it's been in effect
 
05:16:24.170 --> 05:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
now for
 
05:16:27.050 --> 05:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
even even longer than when the first
 
05:16:29.810 --> 05:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
change was made three years ago
 
05:16:31.850 --> 05:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a comment
 
05:16:35.270 --> 05:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I'm in the
 
05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
minority here that gets uh bills from
 
05:16:40.730 --> 05:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
Liberty my bill has the previous 12
 
05:16:43.670 --> 05:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
months on it so that information is
 
05:16:45.708 --> 05:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
already available when they are sending
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
me the bill
 
05:16:48.830 --> 05:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
um I know a little bit about writing
 
05:16:51.410 --> 05:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
code AS do many people here and it's
 
05:16:53.030 --> 05:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
pretty easy to add up 12 numbers and
 
05:16:54.770 --> 05:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
then multiply them by something and just
 
05:16:57.770 --> 05:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
put that on the bill so the assertion
 
05:17:00.470 --> 05:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
that it would be two million dollars of
 
05:17:03.470 --> 05:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
software I see representative smiling I
 
05:17:05.690 --> 05:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
know he has a software background uh the
 
05:17:07.250 --> 05:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
idea that it's a two million dollar
 
05:17:07.260 --> 05:17:08.390 align:start position:0%
idea that it's a two million dollar
change

05:17:08.390 --> 05:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
change
 
05:17:11.930 --> 05:17:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:15.128 --> 05:17:15.138 align:start position:0%
I'm not either we have inflation now
 
05:17:17.690 --> 05:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
05:17:20.810 --> 05:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
or a comment well yes I have a I have a
 
05:17:24.770 --> 05:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
comment my my objection to this to this
 
05:17:24.780 --> 05:17:25.850 align:start position:0%
comment my my objection to this to this
bill

05:17:25.850 --> 05:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:17:28.190 --> 05:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
and this amendment I really could care
 
05:17:30.350 --> 05:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
less which
 
05:17:33.948 --> 05:17:33.958 align:start position:0%
cost we're talking about
 
05:17:36.770 --> 05:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
putting on customers bills whether it's
 
05:17:39.350 --> 05:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
their actual cost based on their actual
 
05:17:42.050 --> 05:17:42.060 align:start position:0%
usage or whether it's their the average
 
05:17:42.060 --> 05:17:43.310 align:start position:0%
usage or whether it's their the average
cost

05:17:43.310 --> 05:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:17:47.510 --> 05:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
um my objection to this bill is that
 
05:17:50.628 --> 05:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
it's telling one side of the story
 
05:17:52.910 --> 05:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's clear that the objective of this
 
05:17:56.150 --> 05:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
bill is to as a couple of members have
 
05:17:58.610 --> 05:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
stated already is to present customers
 
05:18:02.208 --> 05:18:02.218 align:start position:0%
with a number on their bill a cost that
 
05:18:06.830 --> 05:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
quote shows them the cost to them of
 
05:18:09.530 --> 05:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard the
 
05:18:11.628 --> 05:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
problem is we would not be presenting
 
05:18:13.970 --> 05:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
them with any information about the
 
05:18:16.670 --> 05:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
commensurate benefit of the renewable
 
05:18:18.650 --> 05:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard the presumed reason
 
05:18:21.590 --> 05:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
that we have such a public policy in the
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I I do note that
 
05:18:26.330 --> 05:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
that number would would appear on their
 
05:18:29.930 --> 05:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
bill with a link to information about
 
05:18:32.270 --> 05:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
the electric renewable portfolio
 
05:18:34.610 --> 05:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
standard including its benefits at the
 
05:18:36.590 --> 05:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
public utility commission's website
 
05:18:40.208 --> 05:18:40.218 align:start position:0%
however that seems pretty lopsided
 
05:18:44.510 --> 05:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
we can all imagine the fraction of rate
 
05:18:47.090 --> 05:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
payers who seeing this information on
 
05:18:48.770 --> 05:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
their bill are going to immediately
 
05:18:51.850 --> 05:18:51.860 align:start position:0%
Scurry to the puc website to read about
 
05:18:54.830 --> 05:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
the benefits of the renewable portfolio
 
05:18:57.730 --> 05:18:57.740 align:start position:0%
standard you know in the spirit of
 
05:19:00.430 --> 05:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
bipartisanship I would be open
 
05:19:04.010 --> 05:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh to an amendment to reworking this
 
05:19:04.020 --> 05:19:05.448 align:start position:0%
uh to an amendment to reworking this
bill

05:19:05.448 --> 05:19:05.458 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:19:08.150 --> 05:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps not now but in you know if we
 
05:19:11.510 --> 05:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
retain it to um
 
05:19:14.628 --> 05:19:14.638 align:start position:0%
not only present rate payers with this
 
05:19:17.208 --> 05:19:17.218 align:start position:0%
cost information but also present them
 
05:19:21.288 --> 05:19:21.298 align:start position:0%
with information such as that which was
 
05:19:24.890 --> 05:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
shared with us by the New England uh ISO
 
05:19:27.470 --> 05:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
which showed
 
05:19:31.310 --> 05:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
that behind the meter solar
 
05:19:31.320 --> 05:19:33.288 align:start position:0%
that behind the meter solar
reduces

05:19:33.288 --> 05:19:33.298 align:start position:0%
reduces
 
05:19:36.050 --> 05:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
Regional demand and how much that
 
05:19:39.310 --> 05:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
reduction in Regional demand reduces
 
05:19:41.930 --> 05:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
costs for all rate payers that would be
 
05:19:45.050 --> 05:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
a more balanced way to inform and
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
actually educate rate payers about our
 
05:19:49.970 --> 05:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
public policies related to renewable
 
05:19:49.980 --> 05:19:52.550 align:start position:0%
public policies related to renewable
energy

05:19:52.550 --> 05:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:57.170 --> 05:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:00.050 --> 05:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
oh no I'm in favor of transparency I'm
 
05:20:02.208 --> 05:20:02.218 align:start position:0%
in favor of full and balanced
 
05:20:04.430 --> 05:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
transparency that's what this bill does
 
05:20:07.128 --> 05:20:07.138 align:start position:0%
it provides transparency for people to
 
05:20:09.350 --> 05:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
know what they're paying representative
 
05:20:11.930 --> 05:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman it would provide that but it
 
05:20:13.190 --> 05:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't provide them any information
 
05:20:15.288 --> 05:20:15.298 align:start position:0%
about how they're benefiting from that
 
05:20:17.090 --> 05:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
cost in other words it would provide
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
them the cost of their investment but
 
05:20:20.810 --> 05:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
not their return on their investment if
 
05:20:22.070 --> 05:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
they're interested in that there's a
 
05:20:24.230 --> 05:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
link they can go to representative Wendy
 
05:20:24.240 --> 05:20:25.070 align:start position:0%
link they can go to representative Wendy
Thomas

05:20:25.070 --> 05:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
Thomas
 
05:20:27.230 --> 05:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:20:30.230 --> 05:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
oh boy uh with
 
05:20:32.270 --> 05:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
um I I believe my colleague to the right
 
05:20:35.270 --> 05:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
of me um has some valid points but um I
 
05:20:38.448 --> 05:20:38.458 align:start position:0%
also think that see there's
 
05:20:41.030 --> 05:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
no detriment to seeing an average cost
 
05:20:42.650 --> 05:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
because then you could take the two
 
05:20:44.570 --> 05:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
numbers and figure out how you compare
 
05:20:47.208 --> 05:20:47.218 align:start position:0%
to that average cost and
 
05:20:48.530 --> 05:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
um I think the more information that's
 
05:20:51.110 --> 05:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
provided the better although I I do
 
05:20:52.730 --> 05:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
05:20:55.730 --> 05:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
that putting benefits would be
 
05:20:57.590 --> 05:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate but but I
 
05:21:00.110 --> 05:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
I think the average cost I'm okay with
 
05:21:00.120 --> 05:21:05.330 align:start position:0%
I think the average cost I'm okay with
that

05:21:05.330 --> 05:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:07.490 --> 05:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further discussion on
 
05:21:09.830 --> 05:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
this bill I'd ask the clerk to call the
 
05:21:12.170 --> 05:21:12.180 align:start position:0%

in the grand scheme of things I don't
 
05:35:48.650 --> 05:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
think this is uh this is worth
 
05:35:51.230 --> 05:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
worthwhile project if you know
 
05:35:55.550 --> 05:35:55.560 align:start position:0%

or not it's part of getting the
 
05:36:02.810 --> 05:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
installation I don't need someone to
 
05:36:05.090 --> 05:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
send me a little notice about it so I
 
05:36:07.910 --> 05:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
think this is just a waste of time
 
05:36:10.010 --> 05:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the question of
 
05:36:15.530 --> 05:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:18.170 --> 05:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
05:36:20.690 --> 05:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Rose the intention of
 
05:36:22.788 --> 05:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is very clear it's to provide
 
05:36:25.310 --> 05:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
notification regarding Rec sweeping to
 
05:36:27.470 --> 05:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
Consumer generators which is usually a
 
05:36:30.288 --> 05:36:30.298 align:start position:0%
residential rooftop it's just one more
 
05:36:32.628 --> 05:36:32.638 align:start position:0%
effort to make people who are creating
 
05:36:34.430 --> 05:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
wrecks aware that they are creating
 
05:36:36.470 --> 05:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
wrecks and if they do not fill out the
 
05:36:38.628 --> 05:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
paperwork and apply to have those wrecks
 
05:36:40.730 --> 05:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
as their own there will be a taking the
 
05:36:43.070 --> 05:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
Rex will be swept to the energy
 
05:36:45.288 --> 05:36:45.298 align:start position:0%
companies and this is very important
 
05:36:48.170 --> 05:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
from a legal perspective because without
 
05:36:51.288 --> 05:36:51.298 align:start position:0%
notice it's an illegal taking with
 
05:36:53.868 --> 05:36:53.878 align:start position:0%
notice we have enabled by Statute for
 
05:36:55.670 --> 05:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
this practice to continue for the last
 
05:36:58.788 --> 05:36:58.798 align:start position:0%
12 years and so this leaves a loophole
 
05:37:01.730 --> 05:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
in our current statute where wrecks are
 
05:37:03.590 --> 05:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
being swept without notice from
 
05:37:06.650 --> 05:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
consumers who have installed solar and
 
05:37:08.628 --> 05:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
lost the paperwork ran out of time
 
05:37:10.310 --> 05:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
didn't think about it had a hundred
 
05:37:12.350 --> 05:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
things on their mind and one more
 
05:37:14.208 --> 05:37:14.218 align:start position:0%
reminder would put them on notice
 
05:37:16.910 --> 05:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
therefore I believe that this bill is a
 
05:37:19.368 --> 05:37:19.378 align:start position:0%
good way to notify people who are
 
05:37:21.170 --> 05:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
producing solar potential Rec
 
05:37:23.330 --> 05:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
certificates that they have a right to
 
05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
have them and if they don't it's going
 
05:37:27.350 --> 05:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
to go and the monetary value is going to
 
05:37:30.590 --> 05:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
go to a large out-of-state company thank
 
05:37:37.670 --> 05:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:39.890 --> 05:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
05:37:43.550 --> 05:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
chair we just spent a little bit of time
 
05:37:45.948 --> 05:37:45.958 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of time talking about a bill
 
05:37:50.330 --> 05:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
that provided transparency on the uh the
 
05:37:52.550 --> 05:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
bill that you get from the utilities to
 
05:37:54.670 --> 05:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
the consumers this is just another
 
05:37:57.590 --> 05:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
notification that is that provides
 
05:38:01.550 --> 05:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
transparency to the consumers
 
05:38:03.470 --> 05:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you further comment representative
 
05:38:03.480 --> 05:38:05.510 align:start position:0%
thank you further comment representative

Christian
 
05:38:07.850 --> 05:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
I was just going to say the same exact
 
05:38:10.070 --> 05:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
thing um are we against transparency or
 
05:38:11.690 --> 05:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
are we not against transparency thank
 
05:38:11.700 --> 05:38:12.948 align:start position:0%
are we not against transparency thank
you

05:38:12.948 --> 05:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:38:15.590 --> 05:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
further comments representative barishni
 
05:38:18.170 --> 05:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
yep thank you chairman uh in the
 
05:38:20.208 --> 05:38:20.218 align:start position:0%
previous Bill we actually modified it to
 
05:38:24.050 --> 05:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
have it be cost less and I think you
 
05:38:25.788 --> 05:38:25.798 align:start position:0%
know provide transparency and still be
 
05:38:28.490 --> 05:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
as economical as possible this bill will
 
05:38:30.770 --> 05:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
likely have an expense to it so that's
 
05:38:33.350 --> 05:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
why I'm against it
 
05:38:38.090 --> 05:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:39.830 --> 05:38:39.840 align:start position:0%

representative Christian
 
05:40:06.470 --> 05:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
do you have just one more Point um a few
 
05:40:08.208 --> 05:40:08.218 align:start position:0%
minutes ago maybe an hour ago at this
 
05:40:09.230 --> 05:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
point we
 
05:40:10.310 --> 05:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
um just
 
05:40:13.128 --> 05:40:13.138 align:start position:0%
ruled otpaa on a bill that would create
 
05:40:16.270 --> 05:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
a large number of wrecks including from
 
05:40:19.368 --> 05:40:19.378 align:start position:0%
a small residential customers of thermal
 
05:40:20.810 --> 05:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
energy I think that it would be
 
05:40:22.250 --> 05:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
particularly important to have
 
05:40:24.830 --> 05:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
notification given that we are going
 
05:40:28.250 --> 05:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:31.730 --> 05:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
further comments representative Kaplan
 
05:40:34.550 --> 05:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr given the that the
 
05:40:37.250 --> 05:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
practice of sweeping the wrecks
 
05:40:40.430 --> 05:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
is of dubious legality I think the least
 
05:40:44.150 --> 05:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
we can do is try to lessen our exposure
 
05:40:47.090 --> 05:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
to this practice by providing
 
05:40:48.590 --> 05:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
notification to the people who might be
 
05:40:48.600 --> 05:40:49.670 align:start position:0%
notification to the people who might be
affected

05:40:49.670 --> 05:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
affected
 
05:40:52.368 --> 05:40:52.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:54.650 --> 05:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
representative Mick Williams
 
05:40:57.288 --> 05:40:57.298 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Bose I want to note for
 
05:40:59.150 --> 05:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
the record that the practice of wreck
 
05:41:02.930 --> 05:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
sweeping has decimated the market for
 
05:41:04.730 --> 05:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
solar wrecks we're hearing from
 
05:41:06.170 --> 05:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
Department of energy that there is an
 
05:41:08.570 --> 05:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
abundance of wrecks because the
 
05:41:10.070 --> 05:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
suppliers are getting free credits
 
05:41:12.770 --> 05:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
against their obligations so everyone's
 
05:41:14.810 --> 05:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
selling Rex has to accept lower prices
 
05:41:17.208 --> 05:41:17.218 align:start position:0%
or sell out of state to get a decent
 
05:41:19.610 --> 05:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
return or in many cases choose not to
 
05:41:21.770 --> 05:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
participate because it's not worth it so
 
05:41:23.090 --> 05:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
we've created a chicken and egg
 
05:41:25.190 --> 05:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
situation renewable energy in New
 
05:41:26.690 --> 05:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been hobbled for a decade
 
05:41:29.810 --> 05:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
we're talking about climate mitigation
 
05:41:32.570 --> 05:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
issues and hurting Children's Health by
 
05:41:34.368 --> 05:41:34.378 align:start position:0%
not addressing the concerns for our
 
05:41:36.770 --> 05:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
addiction to Natural Gas much of this
 
05:41:39.110 --> 05:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
could be resolved by making it very
 
05:41:41.390 --> 05:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear to people installing
 
05:41:44.090 --> 05:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
solar that they can do their part by
 
05:41:45.770 --> 05:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
keeping their wrecks rather than giving
 
05:41:48.050 --> 05:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
them to a utility instead so that they
 
05:41:52.730 --> 05:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
can then get around the need to purchase
 
05:41:54.650 --> 05:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
something for the renewable portfolio
 
05:41:57.230 --> 05:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
standard requirement so for all of these
 
05:41:59.270 --> 05:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
reasons we're talking about tens of
 
05:42:00.708 --> 05:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in benefit to
 
05:42:02.628 --> 05:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers who provide no
 
05:42:04.610 --> 05:42:04.620 align:start position:0%
benefit to the ratepayers and this is a
 
05:42:07.010 --> 05:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
huge harm that's been caused to our rate
 
05:42:08.868 --> 05:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
payers and will continue to be caused to
 
05:42:11.390 --> 05:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
our ratepayers it's unconscionable this
 
05:42:13.368 --> 05:42:13.378 align:start position:0%
bill is a first step to at least provide
 
05:42:15.530 --> 05:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
notice to meet a bare minimum legal
 
05:42:17.930 --> 05:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
standard thank you

Bernardi
 
05:46:26.030 --> 05:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
do two things at one time here
 
05:46:27.770 --> 05:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to you
 
05:46:31.730 --> 05:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr chair
 
05:46:35.150 --> 05:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
um this bill was presented to us as uh
 
05:46:38.628 --> 05:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
as really applying to Electric utilities
 
05:46:42.948 --> 05:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
but it also these least cost integrated
 
05:46:45.470 --> 05:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
resource plans also apply to Gas
 
05:46:50.030 --> 05:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
Utilities natural gas lines and it seems
 
05:46:51.530 --> 05:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
to me that we really do need to be
 
05:46:54.230 --> 05:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
planning for those so all issues about
 
05:46:57.048 --> 05:46:57.058 align:start position:0%
electrical utilities aside whether that
 
05:46:58.730 --> 05:46:58.740 align:start position:0%
that generation might not be covered
 
05:47:01.190 --> 05:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
that that transmission might not be
 
05:47:02.750 --> 05:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
covered that all that's left is
 
05:47:04.910 --> 05:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
distribution whether or not I even buy
 
05:47:08.690 --> 05:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
that I feel like because the gas lines
 
05:47:08.700 --> 05:47:09.890 align:start position:0%
that I feel like because the gas lines
are

05:47:09.890 --> 05:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:47:13.730 --> 05:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
part of this plan I agree with the itl
 
05:47:13.740 --> 05:47:15.110 align:start position:0%
part of this plan I agree with the itl

uh
 
05:48:16.190 --> 05:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
as the this bill was presented there
 
05:48:20.390 --> 05:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
were several uh concerns uh but
 
05:48:23.570 --> 05:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
um there was still value in moving
 
05:48:28.788 --> 05:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
forward with uh this this bill so
 
05:48:32.810 --> 05:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
I I want I want us to consider that
 
05:48:35.890 --> 05:48:35.900 align:start position:0%
as I recall the department of energy
 
05:48:39.890 --> 05:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh testified in favor of repealing these
 
05:48:43.310 --> 05:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
least cost integrated resource plans
 
05:48:45.708 --> 05:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Wendy
 
05:48:48.048 --> 05:48:48.058 align:start position:0%
Thomas uh thank you
 
05:48:49.910 --> 05:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
um my concern with this bill is that
 
05:48:52.070 --> 05:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's the only place where there's the
 
05:48:54.410 --> 05:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
review of the environmental impact and
 
05:48:58.868 --> 05:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
by getting rid of this we
 
05:49:01.490 --> 05:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
remove reference to the Clean Air Act
 
05:49:01.500 --> 05:49:02.750 align:start position:0%
remove reference to the Clean Air Act
and

05:49:02.750 --> 05:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:49:05.690 --> 05:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
it's it's that's those are very
 
05:49:07.788 --> 05:49:07.798 align:start position:0%
important aspects that should not be
 
05:49:11.208 --> 05:49:11.218 align:start position:0%
removed so thank you
 
05:49:13.548 --> 05:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
during testimony we heard that these
 
05:49:15.650 --> 05:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
least cost integrated resource plans
 
05:49:18.350 --> 05:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
have not been filed for years so none of
 
05:49:19.910 --> 05:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
that environmental planning is being
 
05:49:19.920 --> 05:49:21.110 align:start position:0%
that environmental planning is being
done

05:49:21.110 --> 05:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:49:24.288 --> 05:49:24.298 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds they could be
 
05:49:26.868 --> 05:49:26.878 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds thank you Mr
 
05:49:28.610 --> 05:49:28.620 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
05:49:28.620 --> 05:49:30.048 align:start position:0%
chairman um
my

05:49:30.048 --> 05:49:30.058 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:49:32.090 --> 05:49:32.100 align:start position:0%
recollection is that we heard a lot of
 
05:49:32.100 --> 05:49:33.170 align:start position:0%
recollection is that we heard a lot of
testimony

05:49:33.170 --> 05:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:49:35.390 --> 05:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
05:49:38.930 --> 05:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
while some aspects of integrated
 
05:49:41.208 --> 05:49:41.218 align:start position:0%
resource planning
 
05:49:43.990 --> 05:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
as currently
 
05:49:46.970 --> 05:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
defined in statute
 
05:49:49.190 --> 05:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
have been
 
05:49:53.270 --> 05:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
obviated by the move by deregulation
 
05:49:55.910 --> 05:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
um that there were also several aspects
 
05:49:59.750 --> 05:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
of it that were still valuable and that
 
05:50:01.730 --> 05:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
generally I thought the advice we
 
05:50:03.470 --> 05:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
received was that the
 
05:50:07.368 --> 05:50:07.378 align:start position:0%
rather than abolish IRP wholesale that
 
05:50:10.430 --> 05:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
we ought to improve it so
 
05:50:12.708 --> 05:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
I would be against
 
05:50:16.548 --> 05:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
um passage of this bill which is a huge
 
05:50:21.410 --> 05:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
stroke just ending a practice that has
 
05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
has some value
 
05:50:25.250 --> 05:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:50:27.288 --> 05:50:27.298 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
05:50:30.890 --> 05:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair as as I recall yes
 
05:50:32.570 --> 05:50:32.580 align:start position:0%
there were indeed some potential
 
05:50:35.150 --> 05:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
advantages but the bill as written was
 
05:50:36.890 --> 05:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
calling for things that that
 
05:50:40.970 --> 05:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
realistically cannot yet still be done
 
05:50:45.288 --> 05:50:45.298 align:start position:0%
and therefore it would be far better to
 
05:50:48.650 --> 05:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
craft new legislation addressing that
 
05:50:51.948 --> 05:50:51.958 align:start position:0%
those issues that are still relevant and
 
05:50:54.170 --> 05:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
and move forward with ought to pass on
 
05:50:54.180 --> 05:50:55.990 align:start position:0%
and move forward with ought to pass on
this

05:50:55.990 --> 05:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:50:58.910 --> 05:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
additional comments representative
 
05:50:58.920 --> 05:51:03.170 align:start position:0%
additional comments representative
McWilliams

05:51:03.170 --> 05:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:05.030 --> 05:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
just having some confusion about the
 
05:51:07.430 --> 05:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
underlying motion this is an OTP on
 
05:51:09.650 --> 05:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
House Bill 281 that's the motion I just
 
05:51:12.470 --> 05:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
want to confirm that yes the bill
 
05:51:15.230 --> 05:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
repeals the least cost integrated
 
05:51:18.470 --> 05:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
resource planning statute okay so um
 
05:51:21.830 --> 05:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
speaking to that the the statute right
 
05:51:24.650 --> 05:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
now has the puc look at all cost saving
 
05:51:27.830 --> 05:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
measures including Energy Efficiency and
 
05:51:30.288 --> 05:51:30.298 align:start position:0%
diversity of energy resources
 
05:51:32.628 --> 05:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
the goal here is to keep costs down for
 
05:51:34.490 --> 05:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
ratepayers and we keep hearing over and
 
05:51:37.070 --> 05:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
over that costs are off the charts so
 
05:51:39.170 --> 05:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the least cost integrated
 
05:51:40.970 --> 05:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
resource plan regardless of whether or
 
05:51:42.170 --> 05:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
not it's actually been used or
 
05:51:43.910 --> 05:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
implemented it's been on the books for
 
05:51:46.910 --> 05:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
decades getting rid of that is eroding
 
05:51:48.890 --> 05:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
the whole intention of protecting rate
 
05:51:51.250 --> 05:51:51.260 align:start position:0%
payers and finding diverse Investments
 
05:51:53.570 --> 05:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
we did hear from the office of the
 
05:51:55.490 --> 05:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate with the proposed
 
05:51:58.010 --> 05:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
four-page amendment I think that there
 
05:52:01.190 --> 05:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
is something here to perhaps revise the
 
05:52:03.170 --> 05:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
statute and make it more modern and
 
05:52:05.750 --> 05:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
applicable annually I'd love to see a
 
05:52:07.548 --> 05:52:07.558 align:start position:0%
bill come forward next year to do just
 
05:52:10.070 --> 05:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
that but I don't see anything here in
 
05:52:11.990 --> 05:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
terms of repealing whole cloth something
 
05:52:13.850 --> 05:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
that has been on the books for this long
 
05:52:15.830 --> 05:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
and has the potential to really keep us
 
05:52:17.930 --> 05:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
in line with economic good business
 
05:52:20.570 --> 05:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
practices I I don't see it repealing as
 
05:52:22.368 --> 05:52:22.378 align:start position:0%
a good idea at this point so I would
 
05:52:25.490 --> 05:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
oppose an OTP motion
 
05:52:27.708 --> 05:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
additional comments
 
05:52:29.750 --> 05:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
05:52:31.610 --> 05:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
I would also add that not only our
 
05:52:34.070 --> 05:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate to increase but also
 
05:52:36.830 --> 05:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
other source clf and the nature
 
05:52:39.708 --> 05:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
conservator also believed favored reform
 
05:52:43.788 --> 05:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
of the existing uh Bill rather than
 
05:52:46.430 --> 05:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
let's see actually rather than uh
 
05:52:48.590 --> 05:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
dissolving it entirely I think we have
 
05:52:49.788 --> 05:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
nothing to replace it with and I think
 
05:52:52.310 --> 05:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's foolhardy to in this time of when
 
05:52:54.770 --> 05:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
we're challenged to acquire more
 
05:52:56.150 --> 05:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
affordable energy to throw something
 
05:53:00.708 --> 05:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:03.288 --> 05:53:03.298 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has a comment
 
05:53:04.970 --> 05:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
I'll just agree that from my recent
 
05:53:07.730 --> 05:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
experience it's uh nice when something
 
05:53:09.350 --> 05:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
is broken you should try to fix it not
 
05:53:12.170 --> 05:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
chop it off completely so we shouldn't
 
05:53:14.628 --> 05:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
be repealing this entire statute thank
 
05:53:14.638 --> 05:53:18.110 align:start position:0%
be repealing this entire statute thank
you

05:53:18.110 --> 05:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:19.850 --> 05:53:19.860 align:start position:0%
it's possible that the fastest way to
 
05:53:22.430 --> 05:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
get a new modernized plan would be to
 
05:53:24.650 --> 05:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
get rid of the old plan
 
05:53:28.430 --> 05:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
okay any further comment
 
05:53:31.070 --> 05:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative muns
 
05:53:32.330 --> 05:53:32.340 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:53:35.090 --> 05:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
I believe we should not get rid of this
 
05:53:37.010 --> 05:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
this statute but
 
05:53:37.020 --> 05:53:37.610 align:start position:0%
this statute but
um

05:53:37.610 --> 05:53:37.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:41.208 --> 05:53:41.218 align:start position:0%
to those that have said you know we need
 
05:53:44.810 --> 05:53:44.820 align:start position:0%
a we need to update the plans or modify
 
05:53:47.750 --> 05:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
the plans then I would suggest that
 
05:53:50.750 --> 05:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
rather than repealing this provision we
 
05:53:52.730 --> 05:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
take our we take some time perhaps
 
05:53:56.030 --> 05:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
retain this bill and look at making it
 
05:53:58.548 --> 05:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
better but let's not throw the baby out
 
05:54:00.230 --> 05:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
with the bath water until we have an
 
05:54:00.240 --> 05:54:02.868 align:start position:0%
with the bath water until we have an
alternative

05:54:02.868 --> 05:54:02.878 align:start position:0%

05:56:47.150 --> 05:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr chair
 
05:56:50.390 --> 05:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
I think this is a the way to go we do
 
05:56:51.830 --> 05:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
think that there's a way to improve this
 
05:56:53.448 --> 05:56:53.458 align:start position:0%
bill and I think this is the best way to
 
05:56:53.458 --> 05:56:54.830 align:start position:0%
bill and I think this is the best way to
go

05:56:54.830 --> 05:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:56:57.170 --> 05:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
I would just remind remembers members
 
05:56:59.330 --> 05:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
that if we retain a bill we have to take
 
05:57:01.310 --> 05:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
it up in the fall
 
05:57:04.788 --> 05:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
which could involve several trips to
 
05:57:07.010 --> 05:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
Concord during the fall
 
05:57:10.190 --> 05:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
and uh so far we've retained several
 
05:57:12.890 --> 05:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
bills already just want everyone to be
 
05:57:17.030 --> 05:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:19.548 --> 05:57:19.558 align:start position:0%
it sounds like there are already some
 
05:57:22.610 --> 05:57:22.620 align:start position:0%
fixes potentially in the works from the
 
05:57:24.708 --> 05:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
office of the uh
 
05:57:26.868 --> 05:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
oh my gosh consumer Advocate
 
05:57:29.090 --> 05:57:29.100 align:start position:0%
um and I for one don't mind making an
 
05:57:30.770 --> 05:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
extra trip up to Concord but that's just
 
05:57:35.270 --> 05:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:37.330 --> 05:57:37.340 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion
 
05:57:40.070 --> 05:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you um
 
05:57:41.570 --> 05:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
it it certainly sounds from the
 
05:57:43.070 --> 05:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
discussion like there's an appetite to
 
05:57:45.288 --> 05:57:45.298 align:start position:0%
update this to make it more modern
 
05:57:48.470 --> 05:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know I mean when we retain
 
05:57:50.448 --> 05:57:50.458 align:start position:0%
could we form a committee to look at
 
05:57:54.590 --> 05:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:56.510 --> 05:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
for a bill like this there likely will
 
05:57:59.930 --> 05:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
be a full committee work session
 
05:58:02.390 --> 05:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
to discuss what to do with this retained
 
05:58:04.788 --> 05:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
Bill thanks
 
05:58:07.128 --> 05:58:07.138 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a comment yeah
 
05:58:09.708 --> 05:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
I'll just uh chime in to say that uh you
 
05:58:11.150 --> 05:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
know given our concern with lowering
 
05:58:13.250 --> 05:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
rates for uh for our for our
 
05:58:15.770 --> 05:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
constituents and you know looking at the
 
05:58:17.750 --> 05:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
least cost sources of energy I think
 
05:58:20.330 --> 05:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
it's well worth looking at maybe trying
 
05:58:22.310 --> 05:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
to update this plan so that's it's uh
 
05:58:25.128 --> 05:58:25.138 align:start position:0%
applicable to the pra the practices that
 
05:58:27.170 --> 05:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
the utilities are undertaking at this
 
05:58:28.910 --> 05:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
point so yeah I think we should retain
 
05:58:28.920 --> 05:58:31.128 align:start position:0%
point so yeah I think we should retain
it

05:58:31.128 --> 05:58:31.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:39.288 --> 05:58:39.298 align:start position:0%

from ISO New England and I'll recognize
 
06:01:17.628 --> 06:01:17.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:24.170 --> 06:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:24.180 --> 06:01:25.250 align:start position:0%
 
great

06:01:25.250 --> 06:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
great
 
06:01:28.250 --> 06:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:31.368 --> 06:01:31.378 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I move OTP

it's been moved and seconded that we
 
06:01:40.430 --> 06:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
move we judge
 
06:01:45.230 --> 06:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
HB 443 to be ought to pass and the chair
 
06:01:47.868 --> 06:01:47.878 align:start position:0%
recognized representative Bernardi for
 
06:01:49.548 --> 06:01:49.558 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
06:01:52.430 --> 06:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yes uh I have an
 
06:01:55.548 --> 06:01:55.558 align:start position:0%
amendment that addresses
 
06:01:58.490 --> 06:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
the issues that were raised in the
 
06:02:01.250 --> 06:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
discussion uh that being that the time
 
06:02:04.310 --> 06:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
frame of the commission was too short it
 
06:02:07.490 --> 06:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
extends the time frame uh to the end of
 
06:02:11.510 --> 06:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
2024 rather than the end of 2023 and it
 
06:02:14.048 --> 06:02:14.058 align:start position:0%
adds uh 25 000
 
06:02:18.650 --> 06:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
for Contract Services by the commission
 
06:02:21.288 --> 06:02:21.298 align:start position:0%
so I believe this addresses all the key
 
06:02:23.030 --> 06:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
issues that were raised during the
 
06:02:23.040 --> 06:02:25.610 align:start position:0%
issues that were raised during the
hearing

06:02:25.610 --> 06:02:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:28.368 --> 06:02:28.378 align:start position:0%
so representative Bernardi moves the
 
06:02:31.090 --> 06:02:31.100 align:start position:0%
adoption of amendment
 
06:02:34.250 --> 06:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
0572h is there discussion on this
 
06:02:34.260 --> 06:02:39.410 align:start position:0%
0572h is there discussion on this
question

06:02:39.410 --> 06:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:41.628 --> 06:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
representative berezny has a comment
 
06:02:44.030 --> 06:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I guess just a question is
 
06:02:46.070 --> 06:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars enough to
 
06:02:46.080 --> 06:02:46.970 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars enough to
do

06:02:46.970 --> 06:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:02:48.948 --> 06:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
um the study or
 
06:02:50.750 --> 06:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
um is that where does that number come
 
06:02:53.150 --> 06:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
from and is that enough
 
06:02:56.030 --> 06:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
that number was an estimate of What
 
06:02:58.910 --> 06:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
charges may be we we also will have the
 
06:03:01.190 --> 06:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
reports from Connecticut and Maine to
 
06:03:03.470 --> 06:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
build on so we don't have to repeat a
 
06:03:05.690 --> 06:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
lot of that work so the Assumption was
 
06:03:08.150 --> 06:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
that this might be sufficient to do the
 
06:03:08.160 --> 06:03:10.730 align:start position:0%
that this might be sufficient to do the
task

06:03:10.730 --> 06:03:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:13.070 --> 06:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
further comment representative Wendy
 
06:03:13.080 --> 06:03:14.390 align:start position:0%
further comment representative Wendy
Thomas

06:03:14.390 --> 06:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
Thomas
 
06:03:16.788 --> 06:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
um yeah I just have three things to say
 
06:03:19.670 --> 06:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
um about just this study which repeats
 
06:03:22.310 --> 06:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
what Maine has already done and in
 
06:03:24.288 --> 06:03:24.298 align:start position:0%
leaving ISO New England in general I
 
06:03:26.208 --> 06:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
believe that this amendment is
 
06:03:32.270 --> 06:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:36.708 --> 06:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:38.868 --> 06:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
actually I'd appreciate
 
06:03:38.878 --> 06:03:41.030 align:start position:0%
actually I'd appreciate
um

06:03:41.030 --> 06:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:42.948 --> 06:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
maybe a little more decorum in your
 
06:03:44.390 --> 06:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
remarks than
 
06:03:44.400 --> 06:03:46.490 align:start position:0%
remarks than
that

06:03:46.490 --> 06:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:03:50.448 --> 06:03:50.458 align:start position:0%
any further comments on this amendment
 
06:03:52.910 --> 06:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
06:03:54.770 --> 06:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't I don't see a source of the
 
06:03:56.570 --> 06:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
funds for twenty five thousand dollars
 
06:03:58.310 --> 06:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
I'm a little concerned where it's going
 
06:04:01.910 --> 06:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:04.970 --> 06:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
it would come from the general budget
 
06:04:07.730 --> 06:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that
 
06:04:11.208 --> 06:04:11.218 align:start position:0%
well that's what OLS gave me as a
 
06:04:13.070 --> 06:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
funding source and when I spoke to them
 
06:04:14.810 --> 06:04:14.820 align:start position:0%
that's what they said it would be a line
 
06:04:16.910 --> 06:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
item in the general budget if this
 
06:04:16.920 --> 06:04:21.110 align:start position:0%
item in the general budget if this
passed

06:04:21.110 --> 06:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:22.910 --> 06:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
further discretion representative
 
06:04:25.610 --> 06:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
partial has a comment to the same point
 
06:04:29.288 --> 06:04:29.298 align:start position:0%
I don't see where uh what costs are
 
06:04:32.390 --> 06:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
Justified and spending this sum of 25
 
06:04:33.770 --> 06:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
000 I don't see any justification for
 
06:04:37.070 --> 06:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:41.030 --> 06:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
further comments representative Kaplan
 
06:04:43.010 --> 06:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
you know we're concerned thank you Mr
 
06:04:45.590 --> 06:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
chair uh you know given our concern for
 
06:04:47.930 --> 06:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
uh saving costs I just hate to see
 
06:04:50.208 --> 06:04:50.218 align:start position:0%
public money spent on a study
 
06:04:53.510 --> 06:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh that would lead to a conclusion that
 
06:04:56.810 --> 06:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
that the whole idea is non-feasible from
 
06:04:59.990 --> 06:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
the start so why why even spend 25 000
 
06:05:03.890 --> 06:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:07.970 --> 06:05:07.980 align:start position:0%

.0029 percent of the U.S total
 
06:12:37.490 --> 06:12:37.500 align:start position:0%

taxing people well in the other form of
 
06:12:41.868 --> 06:12:41.878 align:start position:0%

06:12:53.930 --> 06:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
even make it to to a house discussion
 
06:12:55.970 --> 06:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
um the chairman at the time Bacchus
 
06:12:58.128 --> 06:12:58.138 align:start position:0%
tabled the bill so he wouldn't have to
 
06:12:59.270 --> 06:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
hear it
 
06:13:01.490 --> 06:13:01.500 align:start position:0%

06:13:11.030 --> 06:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
needing your home and driving would be
 
06:13:13.910 --> 06:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
your choice not mine is not is not a
 
06:13:15.590 --> 06:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
nice to have in New Hampshire it's a
 
06:13:17.390 --> 06:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
must-have that comes from Townsend
 
06:13:19.430 --> 06:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
energy from Merrimack
 
06:13:24.230 --> 06:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
there are several sources of that .00
 
06:13:26.930 --> 06:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
to 9 percent
 
06:13:29.510 --> 06:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
can I can I make a motion is that is
 
06:13:31.788 --> 06:13:31.798 align:start position:0%
quoting testimony from previous sessions
 
06:13:33.948 --> 06:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
there's any motion on the floor unless
 
06:13:35.208 --> 06:13:35.218 align:start position:0%
you're having a man I make a point of
 
06:13:38.090 --> 06:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
order there is no um
 
06:13:38.100 --> 06:13:40.730 align:start position:0%
order there is no um
um

06:13:40.730 --> 06:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:43.070 --> 06:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
the motion on the floor is ideal you
 
06:13:45.530 --> 06:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
can't visit you can adopt an amendment
 
06:13:47.628 --> 06:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
not on the house sorry no no this is not
 
06:13:49.190 --> 06:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
about an amendment is this is it
 
06:13:51.470 --> 06:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
allowable to be quoting testimony from
 
06:13:53.390 --> 06:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
previous sessions is that allowed to do
 
06:13:54.708 --> 06:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
because it seems that what the
 
06:13:55.910 --> 06:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative is doing is quoting
 
06:13:58.548 --> 06:13:58.558 align:start position:0%
testimony from yes the the
 
06:14:00.410 --> 06:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
representative is allowed to make any
 
06:14:02.570 --> 06:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
comments that she wants as long as
 
06:14:04.730 --> 06:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
they're within the bounds of what we're
 
06:14:06.948 --> 06:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
discussing and as long as they're not
 
06:14:09.708 --> 06:14:09.718 align:start position:0%
loot or lascivious
 
06:14:12.410 --> 06:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
so continue representative not her well
 
06:14:14.090 --> 06:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
well we just had so many interesting
 
06:14:15.948 --> 06:14:15.958 align:start position:0%

okay hearing word carbon carbon dioxide
 
06:14:25.788 --> 06:14:25.798 align:start position:0%
is what plants need to survive and
 
06:14:29.448 --> 06:14:29.458 align:start position:0%
without plants how are we to survive
 
06:14:31.368 --> 06:14:31.378 align:start position:0%

06:14:31.378 --> 06:14:32.030 align:start position:0%

um

06:14:32.030 --> 06:14:32.040 align:start position:0%

on and on I could share this if you'd
 
06:14:34.260 --> 06:14:40.730 align:start position:0%
on and on I could share this if you'd
like

06:14:40.730 --> 06:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:42.708 --> 06:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
I know it's a study but we've already
 
06:14:44.030 --> 06:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
studied it so we're going to study the
 
06:14:45.948 --> 06:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
study that we've already studied and we
 
06:14:47.510 --> 06:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
keep doing this we keep studying studies
 
06:14:48.948 --> 06:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
that have already been studied so why
 
06:14:51.048 --> 06:14:51.058 align:start position:0%
don't we just not study it anymore and
 
06:14:54.170 --> 06:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:55.910 --> 06:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative naughter
 
06:14:59.448 --> 06:14:59.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:01.070 --> 06:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative merner is
 
06:15:02.448 --> 06:15:02.458 align:start position:0%
recognized for a comment one of the few
 
06:15:04.490 --> 06:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
times I'll speak um I was on that
 
06:15:06.110 --> 06:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
committee that some of the subcommittee
 
06:15:08.270 --> 06:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
that I set on to study this and to look
 
06:15:10.730 --> 06:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
at all this we had numerous testimonies
 
06:15:12.890 --> 06:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
from people around the country and just
 
06:15:15.708 --> 06:15:15.718 align:start position:0%
for a point on this carbon pricing and
 
06:15:18.410 --> 06:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
bills there was eight other bills twelve
 
06:15:19.750 --> 06:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
other bills filed around the country
 
06:15:22.070 --> 06:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
referendum questions even the state of
 
06:15:25.730 --> 06:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
uh Washington Oregon Maryland and
 
06:15:28.910 --> 06:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
they've all failed on this topic so um
 
06:15:31.070 --> 06:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
all the stuff that we looked at we we
 
06:15:33.048 --> 06:15:33.058 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time we were in the
 
06:15:34.670 --> 06:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
minority but I sat in on the committee
 
06:15:36.470 --> 06:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
for the summer so
 
06:15:36.480 --> 06:15:37.070 align:start position:0%
for the summer so
um

06:15:37.070 --> 06:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:39.170 --> 06:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
I think we I think we've studied this to
 
06:15:41.628 --> 06:15:41.638 align:start position:0%
death but that's up to you people
 
06:15:44.628 --> 06:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry when was that this the three
 
06:15:47.150 --> 06:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
years ago representative Christian has a
 
06:15:48.770 --> 06:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
comment yes I just have a little
 
06:15:50.930 --> 06:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
confusion so my understanding of the
 
06:15:52.490 --> 06:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
point of this bill is to study the
 
06:15:55.430 --> 06:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
impacts of pending National and Regional
 
06:15:58.070 --> 06:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing that it will have on New
 
06:16:01.070 --> 06:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not on trying to make a
 
06:16:02.810 --> 06:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
mechanism for New Hampshire but just
 
06:16:05.810 --> 06:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what other
 
06:16:08.930 --> 06:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
um legislation not within New Hampshire
 
06:16:10.850 --> 06:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
um on this issue might
 
06:16:13.610 --> 06:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
how it might impact us
 
06:16:16.190 --> 06:16:16.200 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
06:16:19.310 --> 06:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for that comment
 
06:16:23.150 --> 06:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that there are no pending
 
06:16:23.160 --> 06:16:24.350 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that there are no pending
um

06:16:24.350 --> 06:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:26.930 --> 06:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
National or Regional carbon pricing
 
06:16:26.940 --> 06:16:29.090 align:start position:0%
National or Regional carbon pricing
mechanisms

06:16:29.090 --> 06:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
mechanisms
 
06:16:29.100 --> 06:16:30.830 align:start position:0%
mechanisms
that

06:16:30.830 --> 06:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:16:30.840 --> 06:16:31.970 align:start position:0%
that
are

06:16:31.970 --> 06:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:16:34.670 --> 06:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
awaiting adjudication the the U.S House
 
06:16:36.590 --> 06:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
the federal government has a couple of
 
06:16:38.270 --> 06:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
times tried to
 
06:16:41.990 --> 06:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
bring a carbon tax forward and never
 
06:16:44.930 --> 06:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
been successful and surveys of the
 
06:16:47.628 --> 06:16:47.638 align:start position:0%
American public show that 60 percent of
 
06:16:50.810 --> 06:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
Americans do not favor a carbon tax
 
06:16:53.030 --> 06:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
so there is no pending National or
 
06:16:55.970 --> 06:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
Regional carbon pricing mechanisms out
 
06:16:55.980 --> 06:16:57.470 align:start position:0%
Regional carbon pricing mechanisms out
there

06:16:57.470 --> 06:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:17:00.530 --> 06:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a comment
 
06:17:02.868 --> 06:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair uh with all due respect it
 
06:17:04.368 --> 06:17:04.378 align:start position:0%
depends what you mean by pending I mean
 
06:17:07.548 --> 06:17:07.558 align:start position:0%
there's uh huge support in the U.S
 
06:17:10.850 --> 06:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
Senate for for carbon legislation uh the
 
06:17:13.390 --> 06:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
Biden Administration is in favor of it
 
06:17:16.070 --> 06:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
there are trading partners to our North
 
06:17:17.868 --> 06:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
and across the water there already have
 
06:17:21.048 --> 06:17:21.058 align:start position:0%
Regional carbon pricing mechanisms in
 
06:17:22.610 --> 06:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
place and it's already having an impact
 
06:17:24.350 --> 06:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire businesses I think as
 
06:17:27.110 --> 06:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
legislators we ought to be taking a
 
06:17:29.810 --> 06:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
serious look at this just to be prepared
 
06:17:32.448 --> 06:17:32.458 align:start position:0%
it's as the representative Christian
 
06:17:34.490 --> 06:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
said we're not arguing in favor of a
 
06:17:36.230 --> 06:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing mechanism inside the
 
06:17:38.330 --> 06:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
borders of New Hampshire we're just in
 
06:17:40.490 --> 06:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
favor of looking at what the impacts
 
06:17:43.010 --> 06:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
would be should such a tax pass either
 
06:17:45.170 --> 06:17:45.180 align:start position:0%
at the regional or national level
 
06:17:49.548 --> 06:17:49.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:52.310 --> 06:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a comment
 
06:17:55.368 --> 06:17:55.378 align:start position:0%
yeah just follow up and try not to
 
06:17:57.530 --> 06:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
repeat what representative Kaplan just
 
06:17:59.270 --> 06:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
said my understanding of this bill was
 
06:17:59.280 --> 06:18:00.230 align:start position:0%
said my understanding of this bill was
to

06:18:00.230 --> 06:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:18:03.230 --> 06:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
that it would study the potential
 
06:18:06.770 --> 06:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
effects of carbon pricing mechanisms on
 
06:18:08.930 --> 06:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens and businesses
 
06:18:10.930 --> 06:18:10.940 align:start position:0%
for example if the European Union
 
06:18:14.570 --> 06:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
implements carbon pricing or if Canada
 
06:18:17.270 --> 06:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
implements carbon pricing
 
06:18:18.948 --> 06:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
how would that affect
 
06:18:20.990 --> 06:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
the economics of businesses that Import
 
06:18:24.048 --> 06:18:24.058 align:start position:0%
and Export Goods so I see that there is
 
06:18:27.548 --> 06:18:27.558 align:start position:0%
always some Merit in
 
06:18:30.850 --> 06:18:30.860 align:start position:0%
understanding what may be coming
 
06:18:33.590 --> 06:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
next year three years five years from
 
06:18:36.048 --> 06:18:36.058 align:start position:0%
now and not simply saying you know we
 
06:18:37.548 --> 06:18:37.558 align:start position:0%
studied it three years ago and we don't
 
06:18:39.948 --> 06:18:39.958 align:start position:0%
think there's anything new because I
 
06:18:42.350 --> 06:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
think this is carbon pricing is a
 
06:18:45.490 --> 06:18:45.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:48.350 --> 06:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
economic measure that probably won't
 
06:18:50.690 --> 06:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
happen in New Hampshire but it may
 
06:18:52.548 --> 06:18:52.558 align:start position:0%
happen elsewhere
 
06:18:55.190 --> 06:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas thank you Mr
 
06:18:58.730 --> 06:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
chair uh simply stated
 
06:19:01.190 --> 06:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
when we don't know what guidelines
 
06:19:04.788 --> 06:19:04.798 align:start position:0%
National may or may ever have
 
06:19:08.810 --> 06:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
or do I I just you know I believe is it
 
06:19:10.788 --> 06:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
would be a waste of New Hampshire
 
06:19:13.910 --> 06:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
resources to study a hypothetical
 
06:19:17.208 --> 06:19:17.218 align:start position:0%
situation in terms of guidelines
 
06:19:19.850 --> 06:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
when we don't know exactly what will
 
06:19:22.970 --> 06:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
actually happen if it does happen at the
 
06:19:25.548 --> 06:19:25.558 align:start position:0%
national level and if it is something
 
06:19:25.558 --> 06:19:26.750 align:start position:0%
national level and if it is something
that

06:19:26.750 --> 06:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:19:26.760 --> 06:19:27.890 align:start position:0%
that
could

06:19:27.890 --> 06:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
could
 
06:19:29.570 --> 06:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
affect New Hampshire differently than
 
06:19:31.970 --> 06:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
say the states around us and then I
 
06:19:33.410 --> 06:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
think perhaps the study might be in
 
06:19:35.510 --> 06:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
order but until then where we're
 
06:19:39.110 --> 06:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
studying what might be and I don't think
 
06:19:40.970 --> 06:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
we should use our resources given the
 
06:19:42.948 --> 06:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
fact that we have 400 other Commissions
 
06:19:45.590 --> 06:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
in the state so
 
06:19:48.048 --> 06:19:48.058 align:start position:0%
um I can't support that
 
06:19:50.150 --> 06:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has a comment
 
06:19:51.830 --> 06:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
06:19:55.010 --> 06:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
um I will say it since uh the last set
 
06:19:58.490 --> 06:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
of of commissions in 2001 the IMF has
 
06:20:00.470 --> 06:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
proposed a very specific International
 
06:20:02.810 --> 06:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
carbon price floor proposal so that
 
06:20:04.310 --> 06:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
might be one thing that we could at
 
06:20:07.190 --> 06:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
least look at specifically
 
06:20:07.200 --> 06:20:09.910 align:start position:0%
least look at specifically
thanks

06:20:09.910 --> 06:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:13.430 --> 06:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a comment
 
06:20:15.948 --> 06:20:15.958 align:start position:0%
yes to me it seems rather clear that we
 
06:20:19.250 --> 06:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
can either keep this with a carbon tax
 
06:20:21.048 --> 06:20:21.058 align:start position:0%
structure in place we can keep the money
 
06:20:23.150 --> 06:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire going to New Hampshire
 
06:20:25.250 --> 06:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
citizens or you can pay this money
 
06:20:27.650 --> 06:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
abroad in the form of tariffs and I this
 
06:20:29.390 --> 06:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
think having the mechanism in place is
 
06:20:32.628 --> 06:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
this prudence
 
06:20:35.270 --> 06:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a comment
 
06:20:37.190 --> 06:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
06:20:38.628 --> 06:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
Echo what some others have already said
 
06:20:40.310 --> 06:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
that we're we're not
 
06:20:40.320 --> 06:20:41.048 align:start position:0%
that we're we're not
um

06:20:41.048 --> 06:20:41.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:44.330 --> 06:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
really debating the merits of a a carbon
 
06:20:46.970 --> 06:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
tax or carbon trading system one way or
 
06:20:48.708 --> 06:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
the other we're only talking about you
 
06:20:50.690 --> 06:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
know understanding what the potential
 
06:20:53.150 --> 06:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
impact would be and given the fact that
 
06:20:54.610 --> 06:20:54.620 align:start position:0%
there are
 
06:20:57.590 --> 06:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing mechanisms already in
 
06:21:00.110 --> 06:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
place around the world
 
06:21:02.390 --> 06:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
um that it would seem to me that it
 
06:21:03.890 --> 06:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:21:07.810 --> 06:21:07.820 align:start position:0%
um appropriate to look at those
 
06:21:10.310 --> 06:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
understand what the impact on New
 
06:21:12.708 --> 06:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire might be so that we could then
 
06:21:15.170 --> 06:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
use that information to potentially to
 
06:21:18.830 --> 06:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully advocate in favor of an
 
06:21:20.628 --> 06:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
approach that's going to have the least
 
06:21:22.730 --> 06:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
impact on New Hampshire rather than
 
06:21:25.430 --> 06:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
waiting for something to be imposed on
 
06:21:25.440 --> 06:21:26.230 align:start position:0%
waiting for something to be imposed on
us

06:21:26.230 --> 06:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:21:30.770 --> 06:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
and having to um you know fall in line
 
06:21:33.410 --> 06:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
with you know something that might have
 
06:21:36.170 --> 06:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
a pretty dramatic impact on our economy
 
06:21:40.730 --> 06:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:43.128 --> 06:21:43.138 align:start position:0%
further comment representative Corman
 
06:21:46.310 --> 06:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
has a comment thank you Mr chair and I
 
06:21:48.110 --> 06:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
want to speak to representative Doug
 
06:21:51.230 --> 06:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
Thomas's point about uh that carbon
 
06:21:53.570 --> 06:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
pricing uh mechanisms might be
 
06:21:56.750 --> 06:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
hypothetical and why create a commission
 
06:21:58.190 --> 06:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
for something that we don't know what it
 
06:22:01.010 --> 06:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
is and I I understand that concern on
 
06:22:02.930 --> 06:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
the other hand we do have some evidence
 
06:22:05.150 --> 06:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
or there are there are carbon pricing
 
06:22:08.030 --> 06:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in the world so we have some
 
06:22:10.730 --> 06:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
concrete examples and also a commission
 
06:22:14.270 --> 06:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
can create models that that will take a
 
06:22:16.670 --> 06:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
range of parameters so that when carbon
 
06:22:19.310 --> 06:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
prices are are a certain amount you feed
 
06:22:21.650 --> 06:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
that into the model you get an idea so
 
06:22:23.690 --> 06:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
even though we might not know the exact
 
06:22:26.628 --> 06:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
nature of carbon pricing when it comes
 
06:22:29.510 --> 06:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
we can at least be prepared for it with
 
06:22:35.350 --> 06:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:37.730 --> 06:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
representative Carol Brown had his hand
 
06:22:37.740 --> 06:22:38.570 align:start position:0%
representative Carol Brown had his hand
up

06:22:38.570 --> 06:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
up
 
06:22:41.750 --> 06:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and and thank you
 
06:22:43.070 --> 06:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the committee for
 
06:22:45.470 --> 06:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
listening to the the new person here's
 
06:22:47.510 --> 06:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
the substitute on a number of these
 
06:22:49.970 --> 06:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
bills I I noticed that at the very
 
06:22:51.470 --> 06:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
beginning of them in this one in the
 
06:22:51.480 --> 06:22:52.970 align:start position:0%
beginning of them in this one in the
findings

06:22:52.970 --> 06:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
findings
 
06:22:55.490 --> 06:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
they make General statements about what
 
06:22:57.410 --> 06:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
the general court believes
 
06:23:01.670 --> 06:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
and even though many of you support
 
06:23:04.310 --> 06:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
what's being said in there I find that
 
06:23:06.530 --> 06:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
those General statements
 
06:23:09.048 --> 06:23:09.058 align:start position:0%
make a statement to the to the
 
06:23:09.058 --> 06:23:10.548 align:start position:0%
make a statement to the to the
constituents

06:23:10.548 --> 06:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
06:23:13.310 --> 06:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
that this is what we believe as a whole
 
06:23:15.890 --> 06:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
and I don't agree with that
 
06:23:17.990 --> 06:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
good point thank you for raising it
 
06:23:20.150 --> 06:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
06:23:22.250 --> 06:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
comment yes thank you I would just like
 
06:23:24.590 --> 06:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
to remind people that in this field in
 
06:23:27.048 --> 06:23:27.058 align:start position:0%
this rapidly evolving field three years
 
06:23:30.170 --> 06:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
is a lifetime and it would be prudent to
 
06:23:32.810 --> 06:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
put a structure in place to for what's
 
06:23:38.930 --> 06:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:42.650 --> 06:23:42.660 align:start position:0%

commission thank you do I recognizes
 
06:25:02.930 --> 06:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
representative muns second moved and
 
06:25:06.350 --> 06:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
seconded that we judge HB 372 to be
 
06:25:09.170 --> 06:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
worthy of ought to pass any further
 
06:25:09.180 --> 06:25:10.970 align:start position:0%
worthy of ought to pass any further
discussion

06:25:10.970 --> 06:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
06:25:12.948 --> 06:25:12.958 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan
 
06:25:14.930 --> 06:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like to present an amendment to
 
06:25:17.990 --> 06:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh 372 that I spoke about
 
06:25:23.990 --> 06:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:26.810 --> 06:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
what is the amendment number please yeah
 
06:25:28.010 --> 06:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
you might already have it the amendment
 
06:25:30.670 --> 06:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
number is 220
 
06:25:33.350 --> 06:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
2023-0550h do you have that okay
 
06:25:41.150 --> 06:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:44.510 --> 06:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
and this amendment simply uh adds two
 
06:25:47.810 --> 06:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
new positions to the proposed Commission
 
06:25:50.270 --> 06:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
one for the Department of
 
06:25:52.310 --> 06:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
Department of energy the commissioner or
 
06:25:54.948 --> 06:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
his his or her designee and one from the
 
06:25:56.330 --> 06:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
06:25:58.430 --> 06:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
or his or her designee and the idea is
 
06:26:01.430 --> 06:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
obviously the department of energy is uh
 
06:26:02.990 --> 06:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
intimately concerned with the issues of
 
06:26:05.330 --> 06:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
energy and uh ought to be at the table
 
06:26:07.490 --> 06:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
for any discussion or any study of
 
06:26:10.250 --> 06:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing and Department Health and
 
06:26:11.930 --> 06:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
Human Services given their expertise
 
06:26:14.810 --> 06:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
with public health and the potential
 
06:26:17.390 --> 06:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
impact which is the scope of the study
 
06:26:19.490 --> 06:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
the potential impact on public health is
 
06:26:21.350 --> 06:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
contained in that study so they should
 
06:26:23.448 --> 06:26:23.458 align:start position:0%
be also there uh the other thing the
 
06:26:26.150 --> 06:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
amendment does is add a year to the
 
06:26:27.708 --> 06:26:27.718 align:start position:0%
reporting period so that there's an
 
06:26:29.628 --> 06:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
extra year to come up with a final
 
06:26:29.638 --> 06:26:34.730 align:start position:0%
extra year to come up with a final
recommendation

06:26:34.730 --> 06:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:37.368 --> 06:26:37.378 align:start position:0%
is there a second to representative uh
 
06:26:43.548 --> 06:26:43.558 align:start position:0%
kaplan's motion to adopt Amendment 0550h
 
06:26:49.368 --> 06:26:49.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:52.070 --> 06:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
did you second it oh sorry
 
06:26:54.288 --> 06:26:54.298 align:start position:0%
representative partial seconds the
 
06:26:56.590 --> 06:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
motion of the adoption of
 
06:27:03.770 --> 06:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:06.650 --> 06:27:06.660 align:start position:0%
representative muns thank you I just
 
06:27:08.810 --> 06:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
want to support the uh the amendment
 
06:27:11.628 --> 06:27:11.638 align:start position:0%
obviously the department of energy needs
 
06:27:13.010 --> 06:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
to be part of the process so I think
 
06:27:15.048 --> 06:27:15.058 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a great addition and we
 
06:27:17.390 --> 06:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
heard we heard pretty significant
 
06:27:19.448 --> 06:27:19.458 align:start position:0%
testimony from some Public Health people
 
06:27:22.970 --> 06:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh on the health aspects of um of this
 
06:27:24.410 --> 06:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
and I think including the Department of
 
06:27:26.690 --> 06:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services makes perfect
 
06:27:29.448 --> 06:27:29.458 align:start position:0%
sense and finally given the the
 
06:27:31.070 --> 06:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
magnitude of the issue that we're
 
06:27:32.628 --> 06:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
talking about I think an additional year
 
06:27:36.830 --> 06:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
to complete a study is makes sense so we
 
06:27:39.708 --> 06:27:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:47.628 --> 06:27:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:49.368 --> 06:27:49.378 align:start position:0%
seeing Nana I'll ask the clerk to call
 
06:27:51.350 --> 06:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
the role in the me on the amendment or
 
06:27:56.690 --> 06:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:59.930 --> 06:27:59.940 align:start position:0%

06:33:20.470 --> 06:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
06:33:23.930 --> 06:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
just that this is a very expensive uh
 
06:33:26.750 --> 06:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
proposition over the years several
 
06:33:29.448 --> 06:33:29.458 align:start position:0%
million dollars it wasn't the original
 
06:33:33.230 --> 06:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
intent and also it only focuses on one
 
06:33:37.128 --> 06:33:37.138 align:start position:0%
renewable uh as well so for those
 
06:33:41.150 --> 06:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:44.628 --> 06:33:44.638 align:start position:0%

06:33:50.208 --> 06:33:50.218 align:start position:0%
yes I'd like to point out that the T-Rex
 
06:33:51.948 --> 06:33:51.958 align:start position:0%
Bill we just passed earlier only focused
 
06:33:55.730 --> 06:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
on one renewable as well
 
06:33:58.190 --> 06:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Reynolds has a
 
06:33:58.200 --> 06:33:59.270 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Reynolds has a

06:33:59.270 --> 06:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
comment
 
06:34:01.250 --> 06:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chairman yes I'm the
 
06:34:03.230 --> 06:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the Bill of course
 
06:34:03.240 --> 06:34:04.070 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the Bill of course
um

06:34:04.070 --> 06:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:06.230 --> 06:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
commenting on the
 
06:34:07.868 --> 06:34:07.878 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
06:34:10.190 --> 06:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas referred to
 
06:34:12.830 --> 06:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
again that's sort of the
 
06:34:12.840 --> 06:34:15.410 align:start position:0%
again that's sort of the
short-term

06:34:15.410 --> 06:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
short-term
 
06:34:18.110 --> 06:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
back of the napkin I mean I imagine that
 
06:34:20.628 --> 06:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
Doe could have done that
 
06:34:22.730 --> 06:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
calculation on the back of a napkin
 
06:34:25.310 --> 06:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
during which they literally take the
 
06:34:26.690 --> 06:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
price of
 
06:34:28.190 --> 06:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
a rack and
 
06:34:31.670 --> 06:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
multiply it by all the wrecks so not
 
06:34:33.350 --> 06:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
really worth considering we've we've
 
06:34:35.868 --> 06:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
heard that this committee lots of
 
06:34:39.110 --> 06:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
testimony about the RPS and about Rex
 
06:34:39.120 --> 06:34:41.448 align:start position:0%
testimony about the RPS and about Rex
uh

06:34:41.448 --> 06:34:41.458 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:34:42.770 --> 06:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
the point of having a renewable
 
06:34:45.110 --> 06:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard at all is to
 
06:34:47.390 --> 06:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
gradually increase the amount of
 
06:34:48.610 --> 06:34:48.620 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
06:34:51.590 --> 06:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
that utilities are required to
 
06:34:53.810 --> 06:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
bring into the portfolio
 
06:34:55.670 --> 06:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
over time
 
06:34:57.770 --> 06:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
to increase fuel diversity reduce
 
06:34:57.780 --> 06:34:59.690 align:start position:0%
to increase fuel diversity reduce
exposure

06:34:59.690 --> 06:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
06:35:02.990 --> 06:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:06.530 --> 06:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
and hold down costs for consumers so
 
06:35:09.110 --> 06:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
I focus this bill on a single renewable
 
06:35:12.470 --> 06:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
solar on purpose just to so that it
 
06:35:13.970 --> 06:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
would be simple
 
06:35:16.970 --> 06:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:20.090 --> 06:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
the gradual increase the numbers in the
 
06:35:22.610 --> 06:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
bill are modest
 
06:35:26.208 --> 06:35:26.218 align:start position:0%
easily achievable because they would
 
06:35:29.448 --> 06:35:29.458 align:start position:0%
have New Hampshire do gradually over the
 
06:35:32.628 --> 06:35:32.638 align:start position:0%
next two and a half decades what are
 
06:35:34.970 --> 06:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
every other New England State around us
 
06:35:37.610 --> 06:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
is basically already doing so there's no
 
06:35:40.368 --> 06:35:40.378 align:start position:0%
question that this
 
06:35:42.708 --> 06:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
um it's a not very ambitious bill but it
 
06:35:46.490 --> 06:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
would have New Hampshire uh at least do
 
06:35:49.310 --> 06:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
something in terms of positive force
 
06:35:52.788 --> 06:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
bringing more renewable energy into the
 
06:35:54.948 --> 06:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
Supply in New England
 
06:35:58.548 --> 06:35:58.558 align:start position:0%
and reduce demand for precious fossil
 
06:35:58.558 --> 06:35:59.750 align:start position:0%
and reduce demand for precious fossil
fuels

06:35:59.750 --> 06:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
fuels
 
06:36:02.510 --> 06:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
and hold down prices so
 
06:36:05.208 --> 06:36:05.218 align:start position:0%
opposed to inexpediate to legislate
 
06:36:07.548 --> 06:36:07.558 align:start position:0%
further comments
 
06:36:10.250 --> 06:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a comment
 
06:36:12.350 --> 06:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think it's so thank you Mr
 
06:36:12.360 --> 06:36:13.190 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think it's so thank you Mr
chair

06:36:13.190 --> 06:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
chair
 
06:36:15.410 --> 06:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
I think at some point we are going to
 
06:36:18.110 --> 06:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
get tired of being the the donut in the
 
06:36:20.150 --> 06:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
hole in the donut and being the flat
 
06:36:22.788 --> 06:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
line in the regional uh pattern of
 
06:36:25.070 --> 06:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
increasing grid penetration by renewable
 
06:36:27.430 --> 06:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
energy while at the same time
 
06:36:29.930 --> 06:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
piggybacking off the the benefits that
 
06:36:32.090 --> 06:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
that penetration brings in terms of
 
06:36:34.368 --> 06:36:34.378 align:start position:0%
lowering demand and therefore lowering
 
06:36:37.128 --> 06:36:37.138 align:start position:0%
the rate of electricity and I find it
 
06:36:38.750 --> 06:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
incredibly hypocritical that at the same
 
06:36:40.850 --> 06:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
time that's happening we have people
 
06:36:43.850 --> 06:36:43.860 align:start position:0%
here in in our house that will you know
 
06:36:46.730 --> 06:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
shout to this to the skies about how
 
06:36:49.250 --> 06:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
renewable energy is hurting us and then
 
06:36:50.750 --> 06:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
when we have a bill like this one that
 
06:36:53.628 --> 06:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
attempts to very reasonably increase the
 
06:36:56.868 --> 06:36:56.878 align:start position:0%
flat line uh you know that we won't even
 
06:36:59.330 --> 06:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
consider it I think that that's I'm
 
06:37:04.190 --> 06:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:07.190 --> 06:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
I couldn't support this legislation
 
06:37:11.110 --> 06:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
and I dispute the
 
06:37:13.128 --> 06:37:13.138 align:start position:0%
characterization by representative
 
06:37:16.310 --> 06:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
Reynolds that this is a modest or
 
06:37:18.410 --> 06:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
moderate increase
 
06:37:21.470 --> 06:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
or representative kaplan's assertion
 
06:37:25.250 --> 06:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
that this is relatively small this is a
 
06:37:27.910 --> 06:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
huge increase remember these percentages
 
06:37:30.230 --> 06:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
are the percent
 
06:37:34.150 --> 06:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
of the utilities total
 
06:37:40.010 --> 06:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour load that they must uh
 
06:37:41.750 --> 06:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
purchase Rex for
 
06:37:44.330 --> 06:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
and these are huge increases the fiscal
 
06:37:44.340 --> 06:37:45.490 align:start position:0%
and these are huge increases the fiscal
note

06:37:45.490 --> 06:37:45.500 align:start position:0%
note
 
06:37:48.110 --> 06:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
indicated in the first year alone it's
 
06:37:50.750 --> 06:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
an 11 million dollar increase
 
06:37:53.208 --> 06:37:53.218 align:start position:0%
and jumps all the way up to 46 million
 
06:37:55.730 --> 06:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
dollars after just a few years
 
06:37:58.670 --> 06:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
so the characterization that this bill
 
06:38:01.310 --> 06:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
is somehow modest is
 
06:38:04.070 --> 06:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
a stretch at best this is a very
 
06:38:05.390 --> 06:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
expensive bill
 
06:38:05.400 --> 06:38:06.770 align:start position:0%
expensive bill
and

06:38:06.770 --> 06:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:38:09.890 --> 06:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine why anybody
 
06:38:12.530 --> 06:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
would want to go
 
06:38:15.230 --> 06:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
would want to increase cost to rate
 
06:38:19.310 --> 06:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
buyers by such a substantial amount in
 
06:38:21.650 --> 06:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
the difficult
 
06:38:25.190 --> 06:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
Market that we're currently involved in
 
06:38:31.250 --> 06:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:33.410 --> 06:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
section of the renewable portfolio
 
06:38:36.590 --> 06:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
standard that is acceptable but this one
 
06:38:39.470 --> 06:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
certainly is not that
 
06:38:39.480 --> 06:38:41.750 align:start position:0%
certainly is not that
increase

06:38:41.750 --> 06:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
increase
 
06:38:44.810 --> 06:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has a comment
 
06:38:47.030 --> 06:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'll just re-up my comment from earlier
 
06:38:50.030 --> 06:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
about all the research that's
 
06:38:52.910 --> 06:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
been done being done to show you know in
 
06:38:54.890 --> 06:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
some places in the country Renewables
 
06:38:56.930 --> 06:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
are already much less expensive than
 
06:38:59.448 --> 06:38:59.458 align:start position:0%
natural gas as they're on a learning
 
06:39:00.890 --> 06:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
curve they will just continue to get
 
06:39:03.590 --> 06:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
cheaper and cheaper fossil fuels are on
 
06:39:06.048 --> 06:39:06.058 align:start position:0%
no such learning curve and all the
 
06:39:08.628 --> 06:39:08.638 align:start position:0%
technological progress that is being
 
06:39:10.330 --> 06:39:10.340 align:start position:0%
developed there is basically being
 
06:39:12.470 --> 06:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
compensated for by the difficulty of
 
06:39:15.770 --> 06:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:18.230 --> 06:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
I I dispute that this would cost us
 
06:39:19.490 --> 06:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
money in the long run this would
 
06:39:22.010 --> 06:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
absolutely save New Hampshire rate
 
06:39:24.708 --> 06:39:24.718 align:start position:0%
payers money in the long run and maybe
 
06:39:26.750 --> 06:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
even you know
 
06:39:28.610 --> 06:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
what are redefining as long run within
 
06:39:30.350 --> 06:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
the few years we've seen natural gas
 
06:39:30.360 --> 06:39:31.548 align:start position:0%
the few years we've seen natural gas
spikes

06:39:31.548 --> 06:39:31.558 align:start position:0%
spikes
 
06:39:33.530 --> 06:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
cause huge electricity spikes I don't
 
06:39:36.230 --> 06:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
understand how we're debating this issue
 
06:39:38.690 --> 06:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
um and also we've already hit some of
 
06:39:40.610 --> 06:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
the targets and then some that we have
 
06:39:42.830 --> 06:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
set so it's not quite such a stretch I
 
06:39:45.350 --> 06:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
think as you're representing thank you
 
06:39:48.048 --> 06:39:48.058 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a comment yeah
 
06:39:50.448 --> 06:39:50.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I I wanted to
 
06:39:52.310 --> 06:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
follow up on on that comment a little
 
06:39:54.170 --> 06:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
bit I mean I think if you it's important
 
06:39:56.030 --> 06:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
to look at the uh when you're looking at
 
06:39:59.150 --> 06:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
the the fiscal note that the 11 million
 
06:40:02.690 --> 06:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
dollars that is quoted as predicated on
 
06:40:07.548 --> 06:40:07.558 align:start position:0%
um an increase from the the um you know
 
06:40:09.350 --> 06:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
what the current law provides of point
 
06:40:12.708 --> 06:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
seven percent to I think the um the 2.5
 
06:40:14.930 --> 06:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
percent increase
 
06:40:17.990 --> 06:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
um but what it doesn't do is show the
 
06:40:21.170 --> 06:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
where we actually are
 
06:40:23.270 --> 06:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
um are we and are we above the point
 
06:40:27.230 --> 06:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
seven percent now I believe we are
 
06:40:30.110 --> 06:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
um and how does that compare to the 2.4
 
06:40:33.170 --> 06:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
percent so the 11 million dollars we
 
06:40:35.570 --> 06:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
we're probably you know we've probably
 
06:40:35.580 --> 06:40:36.610 align:start position:0%
we're probably you know we've probably
already

06:40:36.610 --> 06:40:36.620 align:start position:0%
already
 
06:40:39.770 --> 06:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
accomplished that objective so the cost
 
06:40:41.750 --> 06:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
is going to be minimal and what it's
 
06:40:43.850 --> 06:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
going to do is just
 
06:40:48.470 --> 06:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:50.628 --> 06:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
representative resident he had a comment
 
06:40:53.030 --> 06:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chairman I just wanted to
 
06:40:54.470 --> 06:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
respond to a comment a little bit ago
 
06:40:59.030 --> 06:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
that uh we increased uh T-Rex and why
 
06:41:00.890 --> 06:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
not increase solar but T-Rex can
 
06:41:03.170 --> 06:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
generate energy whenever 24 7 if
 
06:41:05.868 --> 06:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
necessary well solar only generates when
 
06:41:08.930 --> 06:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
the sun is shining thank you
 
06:41:11.448 --> 06:41:11.458 align:start position:0%
good point representative munz I want to
 
06:41:13.970 --> 06:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
respond to your question about the 0.7
 
06:41:17.208 --> 06:41:17.218 align:start position:0%
percent I was uh a co-sponsor on a bill
 
06:41:20.030 --> 06:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
that raised those solar percentages 2.7
 
06:41:20.040 --> 06:41:21.110 align:start position:0%
that raised those solar percentages 2.7
percent

06:41:21.110 --> 06:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:41:23.270 --> 06:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh two or three years ago along with
 
06:41:25.788 --> 06:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley and that's where they
 
06:41:28.368 --> 06:41:28.378 align:start position:0%
are today 7.7 percent
 
06:41:31.250 --> 06:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative Mark partial thank you
 
06:41:33.650 --> 06:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
chair of owls you know I've heard this
 
06:41:35.690 --> 06:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
argument again and again that solar does
 
06:41:36.948 --> 06:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
not work at night
 
06:41:39.530 --> 06:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
well well if we can use it during the
 
06:41:41.690 --> 06:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
day to reduce our load we're saving
 
06:41:43.788 --> 06:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
precious natural gas and we're driving
 
06:41:46.010 --> 06:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
the price of a natural gas down and the
 
06:41:47.990 --> 06:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
long-term benefit well to become more
 
06:41:50.330 --> 06:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
affordable as it's in less demand it's a
 
06:41:52.310 --> 06:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
simplistic thing to say oh the sun
 
06:41:57.708 --> 06:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:59.390 --> 06:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
further comment
 
06:42:01.910 --> 06:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative not her doesn't shine
 
06:42:03.590 --> 06:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
shine much during the day during the
 
06:42:06.010 --> 06:42:06.020 align:start position:0%
winter either we don't have much
 
06:42:08.628 --> 06:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
energy generated from our solar panels
 
06:42:11.570 --> 06:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:14.390 --> 06:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative Summers as a comment I
 
06:42:16.970 --> 06:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
know that's not a popular comment but if
 
06:42:19.128 --> 06:42:19.138 align:start position:0%
if the current Administration hadn't
 
06:42:21.110 --> 06:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
stopped fracking for oil natural gas
 
06:42:23.030 --> 06:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's on top of natural gas wouldn't be
 
06:42:25.930 --> 06:42:25.940 align:start position:0%
as expensive either
 
06:42:28.368 --> 06:42:28.378 align:start position:0%
representative Carol Brown has a comment
 
06:42:30.350 --> 06:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:42:32.030 --> 06:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
um the first time I sat in here I made a
 
06:42:33.830 --> 06:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
similar comment and representative
 
06:42:38.110 --> 06:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
McWilliams you noted my passion and and
 
06:42:40.970 --> 06:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
then thank you for that
 
06:42:43.250 --> 06:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
so living in Bristol and having
 
06:42:43.260 --> 06:42:44.570 align:start position:0%
so living in Bristol and having
Bridgewater

06:42:44.570 --> 06:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater
 
06:42:48.410 --> 06:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
as my constituents and representative
 
06:42:51.830 --> 06:42:51.840 align:start position:0%

and I apologize if I misunderstood the
 
06:42:55.670 --> 06:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
comment here
 
06:42:57.410 --> 06:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
I've heard this a number of times in
 
06:42:59.770 --> 06:42:59.780 align:start position:0%
these hearings that it's only a small
 
06:43:02.810 --> 06:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
change in the rape and you'll get
 
06:43:06.230 --> 06:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:09.530 --> 06:43:09.540 align:start position:0%

06:43:10.850 --> 06:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
communities
 
06:43:13.128 --> 06:43:13.138 align:start position:0%
can't afford
 
06:43:15.948 --> 06:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
to worry about getting paid back later
 
06:43:21.288 --> 06:43:21.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:23.990 --> 06:43:24.000 align:start position:0%

subcommittee
and

06:53:13.548 --> 06:53:13.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:53:16.430 --> 06:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
I double checked to make sure
 
06:53:18.590 --> 06:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
the only thing that's required for a
 
06:53:22.490 --> 06:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to meet is 24 hours notice
 
06:53:22.500 --> 06:53:24.170 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to meet is 24 hours notice
so

06:53:24.170 --> 06:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:53:28.010 --> 06:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
all you have to do is post a note on our
 
06:53:30.128 --> 06:53:30.138 align:start position:0%
door that says
 
06:53:34.548 --> 06:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
HP 2 57 subcommittee will meet on such
 
06:53:36.890 --> 06:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
and such a day at such and such a Time
 
06:53:36.900 --> 06:53:38.750 align:start position:0%
and such a day at such and such a Time
and

06:53:38.750 --> 06:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:53:40.610 --> 06:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
that makes it so
 
06:53:43.250 --> 06:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
so there's no waiting for a week
 
06:53:44.990 --> 06:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
to get something noticed in the calendar
 
06:53:47.208 --> 06:53:47.218 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work sessions do not have
 
06:53:49.128 --> 06:53:49.138 align:start position:0%
to be noticed in the calendar
 
06:53:51.708 --> 06:53:51.718 align:start position:0%
they just have to be noticed 24 hours in
 
06:53:56.090 --> 06:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:00.350 --> 06:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
so with that we're done and um
 
06:54:01.850 --> 06:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your hard work today
 
06:54:04.070 --> 06:54:04.080 align:start position:0%

06:54:05.990 --> 06:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
