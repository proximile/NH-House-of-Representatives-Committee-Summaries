00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 align:start position:0%
all right gentlemen and ladies um
 
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call this meeting
 
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.750 align:start position:0%
of the
uh

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
Commission on worldwide combined
 
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
reporting for unitary businesses under
 
00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
everybody who has been participating
 
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
actively is here with the exception of
 
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
Senator Murphy who I hope will be able
 
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
to join us um and I know he is staying a
 
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
price of everything even though he's got
 
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
a a busy schedule that required him to
 
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
leave a bit early last last week
 
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just review where we're at
 
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
in the process and what our objectives
 
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
are for today
 
00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
and for winding up over the next several
 
00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.309 align:start position:0%
and for winding up over the next several
weeks

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
so much of this has been said but uh
 
00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 align:start position:0%
I think we had a very productive hearing
 
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
last week and I'm going to review the
 
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
bidding in terms of who we've heard from
 
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.289 align:start position:0%
bidding in terms of who we've heard from
um

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
and so my objective for today is that at
 
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
the very least
 
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
everything we have uh before us both in
 
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 align:start position:0%
terms of verbal testimony as well as
 
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
written submissions that have been
 
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.749 align:start position:0%
written submissions that have been
circulated

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
circulated
 
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
is on the table discussed uh questions
 
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.570 align:start position:0%
is on the table discussed uh questions
uh

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
um are are all you know surface and if
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's any additional information that
 
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
we're trying to seek in order to get
 
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
ourselves ready for writing you know a
 
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
report hopefully a fairly definitive
 
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.390 align:start position:0%
report hopefully a fairly definitive
report

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
then let's identify those today and we
 
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
can have a few follow-throughs
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
I think there could be a little bit of
 
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
that I don't expect that there will be
 
00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.030 align:start position:0%
very much
so

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
at the least we know what's on the table
 
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
and we fleshed it out
 
00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:03.350 align:start position:0%
and we fleshed it out
um

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 align:start position:0%
if we're in a position to see you know
 
00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 align:start position:0%
where the chips are falling and where
 
00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 align:start position:0%
our views are I think it would be
 
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
constructive before the end of this
 
00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 align:start position:0%
session to know where we're headed to
 
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
have the opinion of each of us and
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
understand whether we have
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
um Unity a unified view or whether we're
 
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
preparing to have a majority and a
 
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
Minority Report
 
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.990 align:start position:0%
Minority Report
and

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
I think the most optimistic scenario is
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
that we leave here today in a position
 
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
to say who's drafting what and let that
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
that one or two people get going
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
so on October 17th we'll meet again at
 
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
10 A.M
 
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
and if the optimistic scenario is
 
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
underway we should be able to be
 
00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
reviewing a draft report
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
and make modifications changes
 
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
suggestions and see whether you know how
 
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
close are we to actually having
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
something that uh
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
that we consider a finished product
 
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
I I think it would be desirable if we're
 
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
at that point on the 17th and don't need
 
00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 align:start position:0%
to physically meet again it is possible
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
to do some editing refinements of the
 
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
report and sign offs without having to
 
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 align:start position:0%
get together
 
00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
and of course we have two different
 
00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
deadlines so to speak one is the
 
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
the formal deadline of November 1st to
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
file a final report
 
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
at which point this commission goes out
 
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
of business and the second is as a
 
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
practical matter to assist the house
 
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee and evaluating
 
00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 align:start position:0%
HB 121 representative Schamberg's bill
 
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
on the subject of combined worldwide
 
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.090 align:start position:0%
on the subject of combined worldwide
reporting

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 align:start position:0%
which the ways and means has retained
 
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
and has to file their report to the full
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
house no later than November 17th and I
 
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
believe it's the intention of the
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and the vice chair to to do
 
00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
that in the first week of November so
 
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
I think this is all realistic but it
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
means we've got to stay on our toes
 
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.469 align:start position:0%
means we've got to stay on our toes
um

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
so between our Clerk and our research
 
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
assistant Gen4
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that uh
 
00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
as we go ahead with the preparation of
 
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
the report and and final submission that
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
we have a complete record
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
of um all whom we've heard from
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:55.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
to get a good cross section
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
I think that uh both the pros and the
 
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
cons have been well represented
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
so we have we have Mr opal and his uh
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
two colleagues I see Mr Garros here
 
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
again today who spoke in favor
 
00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:22.139 align:start position:0%
we have uh Miss Beeson and Mr pasetsky
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
um Global business Alliance who spoke in
 
00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:28.010 align:start position:0%
um Global business Alliance who spoke in
opposition

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.629 align:start position:0%
opposition
uh

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
professor hellerstein gave us the
 
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
benefit of a fairly neutral account that
 
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
I think was extremely good on the
 
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.430 align:start position:0%
I think was extremely good on the
history

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
history
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
and provides great context
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
um both Mr bucks
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
formerly of the Montana Department of
 
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue and Professor Shamsky encouraged
 
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.550 align:start position:0%
Revenue and Professor Shamsky encouraged
uh

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
uh approval of this of this proposal
 
00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:57.140 align:start position:0%
and Carl frieden of cost
 
00:08:59.690 --> 00:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
spoke against it
 
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:02.220 align:start position:0%
and then of course the dra without
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
taking a position gave us some sense of
 
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
what the challenges of implementation
 
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
the the record will include various
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
articles from tax notes Supreme Court
 
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.470 align:start position:0%
articles from tax notes Supreme Court
decisions

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:09:22.449 --> 00:09:22.459 align:start position:0%
in the Barclay and caterpillar cases
 
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
some briefs supplied by Mr Garr did I
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
say tax notes articles some submissions
 
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
from the NTU the national taxpayers
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
Union and
 
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
Jordan was the only one called the
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayer Foundation
 
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
tax Foundation tax Foundation
 
00:09:47.449 --> 00:09:47.459 align:start position:0%
um and uh those two NTU and tax
 
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
Foundation were opposed to the idea
 
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
so I will admit that with the very large
 
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
amount of information that's been sent
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
to us I've probably read 75 80 percent
 
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:04.580 align:start position:0%
of it then so I still have more to read
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
and I would strongly encourage members
 
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
to read as much as they can but it's a
 
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
lot and I suspect we'll all get you know
 
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
to different degrees of completeness
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
so we have quite a record and I I'm not
 
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
familiar yet with the procedure but I
 
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
want to make sure between our Clerk and
 
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:29.240 align:start position:0%
Gen 4 that everything that's been
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
circulated becomes a formal part of the
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
permanent record of the commission
 
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
I went upstairs and saw Jen this morning
 
00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:40.019 align:start position:0%
and she says thank you for all those
 
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
things that were sent to her she is
 
00:10:44.569 --> 00:10:44.579 align:start position:0%
making all the physical copies that will
 
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
go into all this will go into one final
 
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.290 align:start position:0%
go into all this will go into one final
binder

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
binder
 
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
so she's on top of it okay very good so
 
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
let's see with with that introduction is
 
00:10:59.449 --> 00:10:59.459 align:start position:0%
there any member who would like to say
 
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
anything before we get ready to queue up
 
00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:06.779 align:start position:0%
a discussion on the issues merits yes
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative Hillary I would like some
 
00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:13.019 align:start position:0%
clarification because the apparently the
 
00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:14.569 align:start position:0%
clarification because the apparently the
Minnesota

00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:14.579 align:start position:0%
Minnesota
 
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
house passed this but I'm not sure if
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate killed it or if it was killed
 
00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:23.459 align:start position:0%
by veto and I'm not sure why it didn't
 
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
go into law
 
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
and I would like some clarification on
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
that if somebody can help
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
all I can say is if
 
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
the Senate did not pass on it it did not
 
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
get legal it was just
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
died a agonizing death
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
to my internship passed the Minnesota
 
00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
house and died in the South one section
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
could have been ways and means but it
 
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.490 align:start position:0%
could have been ways and means but it
died

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:48.500 align:start position:0%
died
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
before it could have been on the four
 
00:11:56.769 --> 00:11:56.779 align:start position:0%
okay so that's a it's a good question
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
has just gone through the same procedure
 
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.230 align:start position:0%
has just gone through the same procedure
yeah

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:12:02.449 --> 00:12:02.459 align:start position:0%
officially died also probably on the
 
00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:05.459 align:start position:0%
form so the question was how it was the
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna ask Jen if she can help
 
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
to clarify what the final disposition
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
and in both Minnesota and Maine was
 
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.509 align:start position:0%
and in both Minnesota and Maine was
and

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
to a degree what you know what was the
 
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
point at which it fell
 
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.250 align:start position:0%
point at which it fell
okay

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
okay other general questions whether
 
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
it's process or information we need Mr
 
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.230 align:start position:0%
it's process or information we need Mr
Kennedy

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
Kennedy
 
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.009 align:start position:0%
Kennedy
um

00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:43.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious relative to uh you know
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
majority and Minority Report
 
00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
um is it possible and I'm thinking
 
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
because of the information that was
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
provided and because of the newness
 
00:12:59.329 --> 00:12:59.339 align:start position:0%
relative to the taxation of guilty in
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the dra not having
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
sufficient information to relay how that
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
might affect
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
the taxation of foreign entities
 
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
that more time might be needed for this
 
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
commission to get data say in another
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
year and is it possible that instead of
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
issuing a report that we would simply
 
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
indicate that additional time was needed
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
or would that simply not be what comes
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
out of this and and that uh
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
there would be another commission that
 
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
would be appointed in another year
 
00:13:41.449 --> 00:13:41.459 align:start position:0%
okay the good questions
 
00:13:41.459 --> 00:13:43.069 align:start position:0%
okay the good questions
um

00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
our charge and our time limit and our
 
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
duty to report are established in the
 
00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
law that was passed in 2022
 
00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:56.220 align:start position:0%
and they stand you know speak for
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
themselves and can't be changed
 
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
so we will file a report and that report
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
we're not under an obligation to reach a
 
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:08.459 align:start position:0%
unified position we're also actually not
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
under an obligation to make a clear
 
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation for or against we may
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
choose to but our report I think should
 
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
represent our best understanding of the
 
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
facts and the situation at this time
 
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:29.420 align:start position:0%
we as we understand it so equivocating
 
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
explaining and identifying what are
 
00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:33.970 align:start position:0%
explaining and identifying what are
unknowns

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:33.980 align:start position:0%
unknowns
 
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:37.100 align:start position:0%
indicating the reason for uncertainty
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
certainly can be a a significant part of
 
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
the report
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
but dodging not reporting are not
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
options and extending our own life is
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
not an option it's always possible that
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature could decide to create a
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
new commission or or do something to
 
00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
extend the life of the study it may be
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
that the action now switches to the
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
House and Senate Ways and Means
 
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:06.230 align:start position:0%
House and Senate Ways and Means
committees

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
but so I I would just say we'll make the
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
best record that we can and identify
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
what do we think
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
would if we had known X Y and Z that
 
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
might have made our report
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
more definitive
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
so I think you know we disclose the
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
weaknesses as well
 
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay good morning Senator Murphy I just
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh We've we've just opened done an
 
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
introduction and a review of the
 
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
information that's before us both those
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
uh who testified
 
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
the written information so there's a
 
00:15:59.750 --> 00:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
huge amount that's been circulated and
 
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.610 align:start position:0%
huge amount that's been circulated and
and

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:00.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
it's kind of overwhelming I did get the
 
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
link to the huge file this morning or
 
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
yesterday so thank you very much right
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
right so you know we're all at a
 
00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:10.019 align:start position:0%
different place as far as what we've
 
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
been able to fully absorb so far and and
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
everything that's been circulated will
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
be part of the commission's record
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
and the purpose today then is to
 
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
evaluate what we have in front of us and
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
decide where we're going
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
so are there any other comments or
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
okay I would along the lines of what Mr
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
Kennedy just asked
 
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.009 align:start position:0%
Kennedy just asked
um

00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:40.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
I would Echo
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
's question it would be great if we were
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
able to quantify how much tax revenue
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
has taken in in recent years
 
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
as a result of the guilty tax
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
and it would be great to identify or
 
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
quantify how much has been taken in as a
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
result of the taxation of foreign
 
00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:06.890 align:start position:0%
result of the taxation of foreign
dividends

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
dividends
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
those are two sources of funds that
 
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
impart tax that
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
they tax some degree of foreign Revenue
 
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
foreign Source revenue and so they they
 
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
might be viewed as
 
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
an offset against what an advocate of
 
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
the combined worldwide reporting might
 
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
expect to gain
 
00:17:33.169 --> 00:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
I've had a conversation with Keane
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
already I think that we have only a very
 
00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.850 align:start position:0%
already I think that we have only a very
limited

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:36.860 align:start position:0%
limited
 
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
ability to quantify those but he's going
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
to look into those so whatever you can
 
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.330 align:start position:0%
to look into those so whatever you can
find

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:17:47.049 --> 00:17:47.059 align:start position:0%
or an explanation of what you can't find
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
would be great in the coming days so
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
that it can be baked into the cake by
 
00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
you know before October 17th okay
 
00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
so that's one line of inquiry
 
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
I think another line of inquiry is
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
to what extent can we delineate
 
00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:09.059 align:start position:0%
the portion of our business profits tax
 
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
that are derived from multinationals
 
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
sub a
 
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
U.S based multinationals sub B foreign
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
based multinationals
 
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
perhaps a different way of saying that
 
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.930 align:start position:0%
perhaps a different way of saying that
is

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
to what extent are our tax revenues
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
derived from filers Who currently use
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that really gets us
 
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
anywhere near an idea for you know what
 
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
this proposal if it was enacted would
 
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
raise I don't think it gets there at all
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
but at least it gives us some sense of
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
what portion of our tax base
 
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
our multinationals in either the
 
00:18:57.049 --> 00:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
home-based or the foreign-based context
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
so those those would be my two requests
 
00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:01.340 align:start position:0%
and I I
 
00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:03.539 align:start position:0%
anticipate there's some real limits on
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
your giving us a good good data but
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:12.419 align:start position:0%
good morning so definitely we'll uh look
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
into getting that information
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
um so in regards to the the revenue from
 
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
the guilty income I believe I explained
 
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
it in a previous meeting that currently
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
we do not have the capability to um
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
which we do have but then we we have not
 
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
tracked the the amount of guilty income
 
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
that is reported on the uh on the New
 
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire returns
 
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
um that is not
 
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:39.310 align:start position:0%
um that is not
um

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
mapped that line specific line actually
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
how we would get how we would propose to
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
get to that number is actually probably
 
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
to back into that number because that
 
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
guilty income is something that's
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
already reported on a federal return and
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
it flows into the New Hampshire return
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
and what is reported on the New
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire return that kind of separate
 
00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:00.059 align:start position:0%
from the federal return is just to allow
 
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
that 50 deduction on the guilty income
 
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
and um so the only way for us to
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
currently back into that number is to
 
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.330 align:start position:0%
currently back into that number is to
potentially

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:14.660 align:start position:0%
get that 50 number and then
 
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
multiply that by two
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
um currently the uh those that form oh
 
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
that particular line on that form is not
 
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
mapped onto the system
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
so mapping that would only give us
 
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.210 align:start position:0%
so mapping that would only give us
information

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:31.220 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
prospectively as opposed to information
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
what that was submitted in the past so I
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
I doubt that we will be able to come up
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
with any kind of um
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
figure that would be useful for the the
 
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
report for for the guilty income but I
 
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
will definitely have a look into
 
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
um for the foreign dividends most likely
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
we might be able to get that information
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
and then as for the water's edge filing
 
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
um yes so the the multinationals would
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
be submitting a Waters Edge return and
 
00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:09.539 align:start position:0%
in for New Hampshire purposes but also
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
just bear in mind that Water's Edge
 
00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
return also includes filers who may not
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
be multinational but but do file combine
 
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
return so they are potentially
 
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:24.539 align:start position:0%
U.S uh just limited to the U.S
 
00:21:24.539 --> 00:21:25.250 align:start position:0%
U.S uh just limited to the U.S
um

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
I guess conducting business in the U.S
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
but then they have multi-jurisdictional
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
so that's a very important Point you're
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
making because the water's edge is
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
utilized by any multi-state company that
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
has to a portion across States that's
 
00:21:40.679 --> 00:21:41.870 align:start position:0%
has to a portion across States that's
correct

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
um knowing how many follow the water's
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
age does not actually lead us to the
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
answer of which ones are multinational
 
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
and would potentially
 
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
take advantage of right we can try to
 
00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
look into that to see if we can um
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
dig into our system see if there's any
 
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
way for us to tell any okay which one
 
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
exactly is a multinational versus a U.S
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
company or solely a U.S company just
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
filing a Water's Edge return we can try
 
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
to look into that and see if we can come
 
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
up with with those statistics
 
00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.830 align:start position:0%
up with with those statistics
okay

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:21.539 align:start position:0%
thank you for undertaking that
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
now it occurs to me also before we get
 
00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:27.299 align:start position:0%
into the merits I've just been handed to
 
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
memos this morning which I believe we
 
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
all have and since we haven't had a
 
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:34.820 align:start position:0%
chance to read them yet one is from Keen
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up to the various questions that
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
arose last week the other one is from
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Society of CPAs that's
 
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
come from Matt
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to ask each of you if you
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
will just quickly walk us through this
 
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
so that we have the gist of what you've
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
got here without having to All Pause and
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
sure uh the email uh this handout that I
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
provided this morning is the email that
 
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
I sent out this morning
 
00:23:03.179 --> 00:23:04.010 align:start position:0%
I sent out this morning
um

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
answering the two questions that was
 
00:23:09.169 --> 00:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
posed to the dra one is to provide a
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
brief description of how potentially
 
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
that the audit process would change if
 
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
we were moving from a uh what is Edge
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
combined filing to a worldwide combined
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
filing and then the other question is
 
00:23:24.409 --> 00:23:24.419 align:start position:0%
what would be what was the uh the fiscal
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
impact uh back in 1986 when we converted
 
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
from the awards from the worldwide fall
 
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
into the Waters Edge filing system
 
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
I sort of answered the first one is uh
 
00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:40.100 align:start position:0%
in terms of the audit process we do not
 
00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
see a huge change in the audit process
 
00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
but as what Fred uh the uh the director
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
of our multi uh director of audit
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
testified last week is that it's just
 
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
more of um everything so be more
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
the volume will be higher in terms of
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
the documentation that needs to be
 
00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.490 align:start position:0%
the documentation that needs to be
reviewed

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
um and uh potentially more returns
 
00:24:08.049 --> 00:24:08.059 align:start position:0%
coming in in the
 
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
analysis potentially could be different
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be a worldwide
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
analysis versus a water station analysis
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
um and then also there could be
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
potential um hurdles
 
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
um that we could see in the
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
performing a a worldwide audit uh and
 
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
we've listed that out here
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
um in terms of currency exchange rates
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
the uh what's the International
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
Accounting and text reporting methods
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
sort of reconciling that to to the U.S
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
system and then the language barrier
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
um and then we potentially could also
 
00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:48.419 align:start position:0%
see um field visits to International
 
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
locations where the rec the books or the
 
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
key personnel are located
 
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
for the second
 
00:24:59.390 --> 00:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
second piece second answer uh this the
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
question the answer to the second
 
00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:03.539 align:start position:0%
question is uh for the
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
the revenue
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
change from
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
worldwide to Water's Edge so when I did
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
the research and saw that um we try to
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
perform a fiscal impact uh fiscal note
 
00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
back then and we were not able to really
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
calculate anything specific because when
 
00:25:24.769 --> 00:25:24.779 align:start position:0%
when we were in worldwide the um the
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
information is collected is different
 
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
than what would have been for Water's
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
Edge because worldwide
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
um the the probably the the denominator
 
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
will be on a worldwide basis we wouldn't
 
00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.169 align:start position:0%
will be on a worldwide basis we wouldn't
have

00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
distinguish okay what is what would have
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
been if it was the water's edge
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
um and then similarly probably the the
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
tax base the income the the revenue uh
 
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
the uh the taxable income from the
 
00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:51.539 align:start position:0%
federal side
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
um will probably be a combination of
 
00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
of worldwide income versus what would
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
have been for uh New Hampshire or
 
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
Water's Edge but we did
 
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
provide the um
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax and business
 
00:26:12.409 --> 00:26:12.419 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax revenue for the fiscal
 
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
years getting back from 1980 to 1991.
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
and hopefully that would be some
 
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
help to the commission as you can see
 
00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.370 align:start position:0%
help to the commission as you can see
um

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:24.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 1986
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
um the well you'll see that um
 
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
so bear in mind this is fiscal year
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue so fiscal year revenue is means
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
that it's Revenue collected between July
 
00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
1 and June 30th and then it would also
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
be for any of the returns that been
 
00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
submitted during that period so it could
 
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
be a combination of
 
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.409 align:start position:0%
be a combination of
um

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:51.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
different tax years returns from
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
different textures that fell into that
 
00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
was submitted and paid so is it probable
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
that the act of the
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
enacting the repeal of worldwide
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
combined reporting in 1986 probably
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
didn't take effect
 
00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
until the 87 or 88 fiscal yeah
 
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
so I I do see a significant jump from
 
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
110 to 150 and 87 do you think we should
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
read anything into that
 
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:24.970 align:start position:0%
read anything into that
um

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:24.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
we don't have much more to
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
um to provide by just the speculate yeah
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
that potentially could be when we change
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
from um from water from worldwide to
 
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
Water's Edge
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative Valerie
 
00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:45.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that's right
 
00:27:50.289 --> 00:27:50.299 align:start position:0%
not enough coffee
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
chart is very interesting although it
 
00:27:57.289 --> 00:27:57.299 align:start position:0%
seems to be showing a decrease coming
 
00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:58.580 align:start position:0%
down from
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
1989. it would be interesting to see
 
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
what happens from 91 going forward when
 
00:28:06.649 --> 00:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
we again had another
 
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
the both of the committee Ways and Means
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
and for this particular report when we
 
00:28:15.169 --> 00:28:15.179 align:start position:0%
have a different type of tax form with a
 
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
reduced business tax and an increase in
 
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
revenues from that which have been at
 
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
least reading the charts that dra puts
 
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
out you guys put out seems to be
 
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
increasing with revenues with the
 
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
decreased tax rate
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
that would be something I would like to
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
also see added into this because it
 
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
would help balance in my mind
 
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.970 align:start position:0%
would help balance in my mind
how

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
the tax policy affects our business
 
00:28:46.919 --> 00:28:49.610 align:start position:0%
the tax policy affects our business
taxes

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
um this this and I also don't understand
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
why it went down and do you have any
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
insight into that from non-89 down well
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
89 down that's that's you know 20 000 or
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
20 million drop in one year is
 
00:29:04.919 --> 00:29:07.450 align:start position:0%
20 million drop in one year is
interesting

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:07.460 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
I wonder if it has something to do with
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that there was a recession with
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
the Iraq War so yes so the
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
I can't provide much more than that but
 
00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:18.539 align:start position:0%
then that's as uh representative
 
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
spilsbury is saying
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year Revenue analysis
 
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.430 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year Revenue analysis
um

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:28.740 align:start position:0%
it's not just what we change in New
 
00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but
 
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:33.419 align:start position:0%
um because our revenue is the the
 
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
calculation of new hash taxes runs off
 
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
from the federal calculation so uh
 
00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
whatever the the companies uh feeling
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
from the federal side
 
00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:45.299 align:start position:0%
would be reflected on the New Hampshire
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
return as well so any kind of national
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
activity that maybe if there's some kind
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
of Boom in the National economy
 
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.889 align:start position:0%
of Boom in the National economy
creating

00:29:54.889 --> 00:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
creating
 
00:29:54.899 --> 00:29:56.630 align:start position:0%
creating
um

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
huge revenues for the the taxpayers that
 
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
probably will will trickle down to the
 
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire returns as well and the
 
00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.049 --> 00:30:12.059 align:start position:0%
I don't know what this would tell us but
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
if it's not a lot of work I assume it's
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
information readily available it is I
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
think would be very interesting to
 
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
extend this chart from the first
 
00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
implementation of the BPT which I think
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
was 1970. two current date
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
again I don't know what it would tell us
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
but since it's so readily available
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps you can have that done yes sure
 
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
I believe that is all these assignments
 
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
no no it's fine but this one is this one
 
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
is going to be too challenging because I
 
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
believe all this information is on our
 
00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
annual report already probably yeah
 
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
so you're helping us by by Framing it
 
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
and putting it in front of our eyes yep
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you yes
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
I presume it wouldn't be too challenging
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
I wasn't doing taxes back in those years
 
00:30:57.049 --> 00:30:57.059 align:start position:0%
could you kind of identify what the tax
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
rates were
 
00:31:00.289 --> 00:31:00.299 align:start position:0%
um and also
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
um include I don't know bet was I don't
 
00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
know when bet was created but
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
um but I'd be curious to see if there
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
were changes in the rate the rates were
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
more or less or if they changed over
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
those years to see how that might have
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
affected sure the total yep but so but
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
bear in mind as well this is fiscal year
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue those tax rate changes would be
 
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
tax unit sure yeah
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
great so that sounds very constructive
 
00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
so I'm envisioning a multi-column chart
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
with the b p t the BET broken out and
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
then aggregated and the rate that's is
 
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
it uh we won't be able to break out the
 
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
BPD and the BET Revenue will be a
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
combined pptm bed Revenue
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
um because that's what we've been
 
00:31:48.889 --> 00:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
collecting the data so far
 
00:31:48.899 --> 00:31:49.909 align:start position:0%
collecting the data so far
right

00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
um and then um so it will be a a similar
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
chart to this with the fiscal year and
 
00:31:59.510 --> 00:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
the bpdn BET tax revenue and then on the
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
site potentially because it will be
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
impossible to superimpose the tax rate
 
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
change on a fiscal year basis so the
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
notes on the first the tax rate change
 
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
would be as a note to to the chart
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
okay right that sounds helpful though
 
00:32:16.799 --> 00:32:18.350 align:start position:0%
okay right that sounds helpful though
okay

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
yes representative schampert thank you
 
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman going back to your
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
King going back to your original paper
 
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
here numbers one through eight
 
00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:30.299 align:start position:0%
uh taxpayer selection all the way to
 
00:32:30.299 --> 00:32:31.610 align:start position:0%
uh taxpayer selection all the way to
closure

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
closure
 
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:38.950 align:start position:0%
 
can

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
audits be done by reporting through the
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.049 --> 00:32:51.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
um have our audit director chiming on
 
00:32:57.529 --> 00:32:57.539 align:start position:0%
that but then I'll potentially say that
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
um we could but then it depends on how
 
00:33:00.649 --> 00:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
much we want to
 
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
um can rely on that information I
 
00:33:06.049 --> 00:33:06.059 align:start position:0%
suppose I I did specifically ask Mr Cool
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
broth to attend today because I
 
00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
anticipated questions would arise that
 
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
he could help us with so if you I'll
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
who said bud
 
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
Fred cool broth director of audit for
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
the record uh and thanks to the
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
commission again for having me here so
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
to to answer your question
 
00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.350 align:start position:0%
to to answer your question
representative

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
I do Envision some worldwide worldwide
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
audits occurring
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
domestic offices of these companies
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
uh that the that determination
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
would be based off of
 
00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:00.059 align:start position:0%
who the taxpayer is what their worldwide
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
operations look like and thus who we can
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
be expected to meet and what documents
 
00:34:10.609 --> 00:34:10.619 align:start position:0%
we can be expected to find
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
at their domestic offices their domestic
 
00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:16.379 align:start position:0%
headquarters so
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
if it's reasonable based on the
 
00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
competition the composition of the
 
00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:25.379 align:start position:0%
taxpayer if it's reasonable that uh
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
the hosting the audit domestically
 
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
would yield the type of information we
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
would want provided
 
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
then we would do it there just like
 
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
under a Water's Edge audit where we
 
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
would send field Auditors to their
 
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
domestic offices interview folks there
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
start the document production process at
 
00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
their local offices
 
00:34:54.899 --> 00:34:55.909 align:start position:0%
their local offices
oh

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
Mr well then
 
00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:00.260 align:start position:0%
let me ask this
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
can the Revenue Agency adopt rules
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
requiring the maintenance and
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
availability for audit of taxpayer
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
information relevant to the conduct of
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
worldwide tax auditing I mean could all
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
that information you need
 
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
to ever do a worldwide audit be sent to
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
that subsidiary office for you to
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
undertake without having to
 
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
use uh
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know you mentioned language you
 
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned I can't the dra set their own
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
rules or regulations yep so
 
00:35:39.849 --> 00:35:39.859 align:start position:0%
we can adopt that rule
 
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
to the extent taxpayers will comply with
 
00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
it would be to be determined we have
 
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:47.099 align:start position:0%
plenty of rules now that we've adopted
 
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
that taxpayers don't comply with
 
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.150 align:start position:0%
that taxpayers don't comply with
um

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:53.089 --> 00:35:53.099 align:start position:0%
the challenges we would run into even
 
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
with perfect
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
compliance with that and
 
00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:02.060 align:start position:0%
there would be both unintentional and
 
00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
potentially intentional non-compliance
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
um but the the challenges there would be
 
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
we'd get pushback for certain types of
 
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
Records most of this stuff can be
 
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
provided electronically and we we do
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
receive the bulk of our records
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
through electronic transmittal
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
some and I think Dan Buck's testified to
 
00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:31.370 align:start position:0%
some and I think Dan Buck's testified to
this

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
during the last commission meeting I
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
think maybe Keynes mentioned this but at
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
any rate there are certain
 
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
certain documents that companies
 
00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:47.180 align:start position:0%
tend not to or sometimes do not preserve
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
completely in digital form
 
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.349 align:start position:0%
completely in digital form
um

00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
but the
 
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.910 align:start position:0%
but the
the

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:59.329 --> 00:36:59.339 align:start position:0%
main drawback to this to that approach
 
00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
we still would be missing
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity opportunities that we could
 
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.510 align:start position:0%
opportunity opportunities that we could
only

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
we would only have if we traveled to
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
their other foreign locations so
 
00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.370 align:start position:0%
their other foreign locations so
um

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
seeing where all of their records are
 
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
kept originally seeing
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
those operations interviewing those
 
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.370 align:start position:0%
those operations interviewing those
people

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
so there would be limits there will be
 
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
limits on that approach but to to answer
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
your question we can adopt that rule
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
and there presumably would be some
 
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
amount of compliance with it I'm I don't
 
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
know that there would I am skeptical
 
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
can I ask
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
questions Keen
 
00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
in the dra annual audits
 
00:38:01.859 --> 00:38:04.089 align:start position:0%
in the dra annual audits
from

00:38:04.089 --> 00:38:04.099 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:09.829 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
I see their
 
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
I don't these are fines
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
or are they
 
00:38:19.079 --> 00:38:21.050 align:start position:0%
or are they
misapplied

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
misapplied
 
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh ways that they deducted their money
 
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
you say no no you can't deduct this you
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
let me pass this can I pass this down to
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
Keynes for him to look at them all right
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
you do audits
 
00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.290 align:start position:0%
you do audits
and

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
you come up with like 36 million in
 
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.810 align:start position:0%
you come up with like 36 million in
2022.

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.550 align:start position:0%
2022.
um

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
are these just
 
00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
technical errors that people have
 
00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.140 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted the the the domestic
 
00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.530 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted the the the domestic
uh

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
maybe they didn't think they were going
 
00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
when you do those audits yes
 
00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
I might have to pass this on to Fred so
 
00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:17.660 align:start position:0%
this looks like a document that
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
tables that are that tracks the um from
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
fiscalia try 12 to 22
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
um the audit division report on our
 
00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
annual report
 
00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:30.890 align:start position:0%
annual report
um

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
potentially talks about something to do
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
with non-compliance of in a certain in a
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
certain manner I am not super familiar
 
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
with this but I'm going to pass it on to
 
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.930 align:start position:0%
with this but I'm going to pass it on to
correct

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
and the reason I ask it Keen I'm sorry
 
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
so just just to be clear and be the
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
purpose of today is a all-out discussion
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to keep it very informal
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
that this this should just be an
 
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
opportunity to flesh everything out sure
 
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
what this looks like to me is not a
 
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619 align:start position:0%
document that the audit division
 
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
prepared but it looks like
 
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
information that came from our annual
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
reports and was reorganized yeah so this
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
looks like our if I can just clarify
 
00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
sure uh so the dollar column the the
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
second column next to the year next to
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year would be our total
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
assessment amounts
 
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
I believe this is tax only but there
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
might be interest in payments in these
 
00:40:52.609 --> 00:40:52.619 align:start position:0%
amounts not sure that's super relevant
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
looks to be the number of a term of
 
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
returns that we adjusted as a result of
 
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
those audits
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
and to answer your question
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
these adjustments reflect a variety of
 
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
issues and
 
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
and frankly motivations behind the
 
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
non-compliance so
 
00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:26.339 align:start position:0%
based on the size of the taxpayer and
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
their activity here they may be able to
 
00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:31.490 align:start position:0%
their activity here they may be able to
allocate

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
allocate
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
um a certain amount of
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
resources and time to Preparing their
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire tax return and then
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
there's one taxpayer in particular I'm
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
thinking about I will obviously not name
 
00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:43.460 align:start position:0%
them for confidentiality purposes but
 
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
a very large multinational let's put it
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
that way they're active
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
everywhere not just domestically but
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
across the world and it's very obvious
 
00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339 align:start position:0%
when you look at their return that the
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
way they treat New Hampshire is we
 
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
really can't justify spending a lot of
 
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
time preparing this return just throw a
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of money at them and
 
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
hope they go away and
 
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:08.349 align:start position:0%
hope they go away and
um

00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
historically our audit presence of this
 
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
taxpayer has been pretty light because
 
00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
when you look at it it's like okay this
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
is very sloppy but
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
if we were to adjust this I don't know I
 
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
don't know where this would go they've
 
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
just done this at a very high level
 
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
obviously to make it through audit
 
00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:26.339 align:start position:0%
selection and it looks reasonable on its
 
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
face so they don't get selected that
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
kind of behavior is on the one end of
 
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
the spectrum where
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of where the taxpayer lands
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
in their payment to New Hampshire and
 
00:42:41.089 --> 00:42:41.099 align:start position:0%
their tax they just there's only so much
 
00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:43.220 align:start position:0%
in terms of resources
 
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
and um that at the end of the day that
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
behavior might result in a big
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
adjustment from New Hampshire if we do
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
select them prod it
 
00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.829 align:start position:0%
select them prod it
um

00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
not this taxpayer but a different one if
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
we do select a taxpayer and it becomes
 
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
apparent that they've not spent a lot of
 
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
time with our rules they've misapplied
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
several Concepts there could be big
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
adjustments coming out of New Hampshire
 
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
and the size of that adjustment doesn't
 
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
necessarily reflect malintent on their
 
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
part it's just there's only so much
 
00:43:17.569 --> 00:43:17.579 align:start position:0%
they've got a limited staff huge
 
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
presence and they just they do their
 
00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.290 align:start position:0%
presence and they just they do their
best

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:20.300 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:43:23.569 --> 00:43:23.579 align:start position:0%
so sometimes that behavior means New
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it might actually
 
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
win in a sense because the taxpayer just
 
00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
throws their hands up and throws what
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire is a sizable amount of
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
money at us sometimes they under report
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
on the other end of the spectrum for
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
sure there are taxpayers reflected in
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
these numbers who engage in very
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
deliberate very often sophisticated tax
 
00:43:45.599 --> 00:43:46.730 align:start position:0%
deliberate very often sophisticated tax
planning

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
planning
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
and when we find that we bust that up
 
00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:51.140 align:start position:0%
and we assess them and that can be large
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
but it's a spectrum with the one one
 
00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayer on one end of the spectrum who
 
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
has underreported or underpaid their tax
 
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
through no Mal intent just ignorance and
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
lack of resources to the other end of
 
00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
the spectrum where it's the result of
 
00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:14.339 align:start position:0%
very deliberate tax planning and uh
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
with to to what extent that's just
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
aggressive positions that we Challenge
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
and we'll take an assessment on or we'll
 
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
issue an assessment on or to what extent
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
it even Rises beyond that to potential
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
criminal activity that's a different
 
00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:33.020 align:start position:0%
discussion but both those
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
far-ranging sides of the spectrum and
 
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
then everything in between are
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
encompassed in these numbers here so the
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
size of the adjustment isn't always
 
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
reflective of what's going on in
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
people's heads
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes people will engage in really
 
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
sophisticated tax planning just to save
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
a buck and it's like I don't know what
 
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
the what the purpose of that is other
 
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
than you think you're getting one over
 
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
so if I'm interpreting you correctly
 
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
a filer who is trying to ease up on the
 
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
administrative burden might even round
 
00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:11.579 align:start position:0%
up yes
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
that for sure happens we don't know
 
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
what's the prevailing practice but we
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
suspect that's at least one of the
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
scenarios that's one of the scenarios I
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to suggest that that's common
 
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
but it does happen it happens from some
 
00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:26.819 --> 00:45:32.809 align:start position:0%
 
games

00:45:32.809 --> 00:45:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
well he's opened the door here and Mr
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
Kennedy opened the door last week on a
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
question I have here
 
00:45:39.839 --> 00:45:41.690 align:start position:0%
question I have here
guilty

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
guilty
 
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
only taxes U.S based multinational
 
00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.490 align:start position:0%
only taxes U.S based multinational
companies

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:45:50.089 --> 00:45:50.099 align:start position:0%
or all the applies to U.S based National
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
companies multinational or Mr Foley I'm
 
00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.109 align:start position:0%
companies multinational or Mr Foley I'm
sorry

00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh it does not apply to foreign National
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
does it not it only applies to U.S
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so U.S persons flow through
 
00:46:05.569 --> 00:46:05.579 align:start position:0%
businesses which are taxes entities
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
obviously New Hampshire
 
00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
USC Corps this this would flow up to
 
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
them so recall I gave that wonderful
 
00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
explanation 10 we have to have a U.S
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
person which can be a flow through trust
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
what have you they have to own it
 
00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh an interest in a foreign entity and
 
00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
there's an aggregation but correct
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
so my follow-up question to you then
 
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
would be our U.S multinationals taxed
 
00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
one-way and
 
00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
all depends because you've got a giant
 
00:46:47.809 --> 00:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
mixed bag right
 
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
um in that you could have a foreign
 
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
parented group that has a U.S entity
 
00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
that from there has
 
00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
Mexico and Canada underneath it or its
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
own subsidiary so it could be this chain
 
00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.230 align:start position:0%
own subsidiary so it could be this chain
right

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
um but in general income earned by the
 
00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
foreign parent or other foreign brother
 
00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
sister companies right so if the US was
 
00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
a subsidiary one that income's not going
 
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
to be subject in general to the U.S tax
 
00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:15.349 align:start position:0%
to be subject in general to the U.S tax
base

00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
if I can just make sure we're clear on
 
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:19.130 align:start position:0%
if I can just make sure we're clear on
this

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:19.140 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't reach the foreign sourced
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
income but it does reach the U.S income
 
00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
of a foreign entities U.S based
 
00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.890 align:start position:0%
of a foreign entities U.S based
operation

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:34.250 align:start position:0%
operation
correct

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
um I also want to just want to add that
 
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:39.380 align:start position:0%
if a foreign company
 
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
that conducts business activity in New
 
00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.069 align:start position:0%
that conducts business activity in New
Hampshire

00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
they will be subject to New Hampshire
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
taxes as well right next
 
00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:49.140 align:start position:0%
oh yes so they if they have business
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
activity in New Hampshire
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and they will be filing as a
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
potentially like a like a separate
 
00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.270 align:start position:0%
potentially like a like a separate
company

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:58.619 align:start position:0%
um other than you know so they would be
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.690 align:start position:0%
okay
good

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.890 align:start position:0%
good
um

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
the takeaway that I
 
00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
have on the audit process is it's the
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
same process correct but it's the more
 
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
of everything and the complications
 
00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.910 align:start position:0%
of everything and the complications
um

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:23.569 --> 00:48:23.579 align:start position:0%
sometimes we legislators make very loose
 
00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
analyzes when we try to understand
 
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
things but
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh I had the interesting experience of
 
00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
working in the Netherlands for several
 
00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.930 align:start position:0%
working in the Netherlands for several
years

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm talking about personal income tax
 
00:48:38.089 --> 00:48:38.099 align:start position:0%
which is distinct
 
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
and of course in personal income tax
 
00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
what happens is you pay
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
the tax of the foreign country in which
 
00:48:46.609 --> 00:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
you're working
 
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
and then you take a credit
 
00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
and prepare U.S tax return I've always
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
done my own tax returns with the
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
exception of three years where I lived
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
in Europe
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
and just the experience of being an
 
00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.109 align:start position:0%
and just the experience of being an
individual

00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
resulting in a tax return approximately
 
00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:10.619 align:start position:0%
an inch thick that I couldn't understand
 
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
even when the tax accountant prepared it
 
00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
and presented it to me and I'm saying I
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
couldn't understand it as someone who
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
has always prepared his own tax returns
 
00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.089 align:start position:0%
has always prepared his own tax returns
otherwise

00:49:23.089 --> 00:49:23.099 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
so extrapolating from that very loosely
 
00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:29.180 align:start position:0%
I can only imagine
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
the complexity of
 
00:49:37.609 --> 00:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
drawing in foreign Source Revenue
 
00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:39.260 align:start position:0%
from potentially
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
dozens if not hundreds of different
 
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.069 align:start position:0%
dozens if not hundreds of different
entities

00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
entities
 
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
I also had the experience during that
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
time in the Netherlands
 
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
of being the general manager for
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
marketing of the largest shipping
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
company in the world for all of Europe
 
00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
and Middle East so I was responsible for
 
00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
34 countries
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
and I saw
 
00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.190 align:start position:0%
and I saw
um

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
what the challenges are of trying to
 
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
coordinate an Enterprise across 34
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
currencies this was before the euro
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
and not quite 34 but nearly as many
 
00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
languages it's extraordinarily difficult
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
if we're trying to take the measure of
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
foreign earned income the Auditors at
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
least need to have the authority the
 
00:50:31.609 --> 00:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
power if necessary
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
to look behind what they've been
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
presented that's the fundamental nature
 
00:50:37.609 --> 00:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
of an audit
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
and those kinds of records that are
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
going to back up
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
what the foreign foreign Source revenue
 
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
of Affiliated units that have no direct
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
activity in the United States themselves
 
00:50:54.109 --> 00:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
is not going to be held by
 
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
a subsidiary office in the United States
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
I can't even imagine the sweep of the
 
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
document request if you were to insist
 
00:51:07.849 --> 00:51:07.859 align:start position:0%
that the U.S based subsidiary became the
 
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
repository for all of the records of the
 
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
various foreign Affiliates it's
 
00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:14.150 align:start position:0%
various foreign Affiliates it's
unimaginable

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
unimaginable
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't even know
 
00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
whether they had fulfilled the request
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:51:23.329 --> 00:51:23.339 align:start position:0%
and so I do think representative
 
00:51:27.049 --> 00:51:27.059 align:start position:0%
Schaumburg that the audit
 
00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:29.099 align:start position:0%
not everybody gets audited
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
some people get light audits some people
 
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
get intensive audits but in the event of
 
00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
an intensive audit
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
being unable to go to the source
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
documents and make random searches uh
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
would completely handicap the audit in
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
so I again I mean I'm just an individual
 
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
extrapolating out the amount of
 
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:53.870 align:start position:0%
extrapolating out the amount of
complexity

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
complexity
 
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
involved is just staggering practically
 
00:51:56.220 --> 00:52:02.109 align:start position:0%
involved is just staggering practically
indescribable

00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:03.829 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
yes my question is
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
just looking forward yep okay since
 
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
we're going to a single sales Factor all
 
00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:13.910 align:start position:0%
we're going to a single sales Factor all
right

00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.170 align:start position:0%
right
uh

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
does the single sales Factor method
 
00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
affect New Hampshire's taxation of
 
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
foreign dividends received by U.S
 
00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.510 align:start position:0%
foreign dividends received by U.S
multinationals

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
multinationals
 
00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:26.660 align:start position:0%
uh since we dropped the old
 
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
method of payroll yes property yep
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so
 
00:52:33.839 --> 00:52:35.630 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so
the

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
foreign dividends get separate
 
00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.130 align:start position:0%
foreign dividends get separate
apportionment

00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:40.140 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
um from the rest of from from all other
 
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
income so as you know representative
 
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
Schamberg we take
 
00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:50.210 align:start position:0%
Schamberg we take
um

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
we take all other sources of income into
 
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
the return We subject them to New
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire apportionment and uh and that
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
gives us our apportionment percentage
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
the foreign dividends and income classes
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
like foreign dividends so guilty subpart
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
F but all of those all of those uh
 
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
income classes that some folks have
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
called foreign income
 
00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.089 align:start position:0%
called foreign income
um

00:53:17.089 --> 00:53:17.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:19.849 --> 00:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
they get separate apportionment
 
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
treatment in the New Hampshire returns
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
so they get carved out of the general
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
apportionment they get their own
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
apportionment and
 
00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:29.150 align:start position:0%
apportionment and
um

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:32.569 --> 00:53:32.579 align:start position:0%
and then get added back in to the to the
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
whole into the hopper at the end of it
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
to generate your full New Hampshire tax
 
00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.530 align:start position:0%
to generate your full New Hampshire tax
liability

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of how
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh excluding the other
 
00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.329 align:start position:0%
uh excluding the other
um

00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:47.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:49.609 --> 00:53:49.619 align:start position:0%
the other apportionment the traditional
 
00:53:53.089 --> 00:53:53.099 align:start position:0%
three factors payroll and property
 
00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
taking them out of it
 
00:53:58.849 --> 00:53:58.859 align:start position:0%
there are winners and losers to doing
 
00:53:58.859 --> 00:53:59.990 align:start position:0%
there are winners and losers to doing
that

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:00.710 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:02.329 --> 00:54:02.339 align:start position:0%
some folks
 
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
with a lot of payroll and property here
 
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
benefit from or tend to stand to benefit
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
from single sales Factor because now
 
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.030 align:start position:0%
from single sales Factor because now
there's

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
those amounts no longer count towards
 
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
their apportionment folks who
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
traditionally benefited from not having
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
much of a footprint here in New
 
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with people payroll or people
 
00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
they um they stand attended quote
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
unquote become losers I don't like that
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
term but they tend to see a potential
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
increase in their tax liability move
 
00:54:37.849 --> 00:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
into single sales Factor we don't have
 
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
as you noted we've just gone there the
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
data is just coming in basically right
 
00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
now so we don't really have a good sense
 
00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
for how that shakes out
 
00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:50.809 align:start position:0%
for how that shakes out
um

00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
so we don't know whether that moved to
 
00:54:56.569 --> 00:54:56.579 align:start position:0%
um to single sales factor in isolation
 
00:54:58.970 --> 00:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
we don't know if that will be Revenue
 
00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:01.740 align:start position:0%
neutral or Revenue positive for the
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
state we're still waiting to see what
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
what happens there and
 
00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
um then to what extent you can
 
00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:12.380 align:start position:0%
parse that out from all the other
 
00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:15.059 align:start position:0%
factors that weigh in on their tax base
 
00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
like Keane was talking about before a
 
00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:19.460 align:start position:0%
broader economic trends
 
00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
what else is going on at the federal
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
level that sort of thing it's it's I
 
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
leave that to key into the in his team
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
to decide what they can parse out from
 
00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
that but
 
00:55:31.849 --> 00:55:31.859 align:start position:0%
as a general matter I do think it's it's
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
a little early for us to be able to tell
 
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
how the
 
00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
what the revenue impact is for moving to
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
single sales
 
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
so we I I'm sure we will come back to
 
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:52.740 align:start position:0%
the single sales Factor uh influences we
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
keep talking about it it
 
00:55:59.569 --> 00:55:59.579 align:start position:0%
um anything else for This Moment On The
 
00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:02.220 align:start position:0%
Memo from King Wong
 
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
if not
 
00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
uh Matt Foley has also provided us
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
something that I haven't read yet not do
 
00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
you want to just give us a quick
 
00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:12.049 align:start position:0%
you want to just give us a quick
overview

00:56:12.049 --> 00:56:12.059 align:start position:0%
overview
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
sure it's this is from the society and
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's almost on the other side of of
 
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
Keene so this is more of the
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
practitioner perspective right so what
 
00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
does this mean to us more work
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
um you know at the end of the day
 
00:56:28.849 --> 00:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
um it was interesting I I forget to
 
00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
report and I know it was back from the
 
00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
80s but the 900 dollars to prepare one
 
00:56:35.329 --> 00:56:35.339 align:start position:0%
of these worldwide returns I think was
 
00:56:35.339 --> 00:56:37.069 align:start position:0%
of these worldwide returns I think was
floated

00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
floated
 
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
um and it's interesting to hear that we
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
wish right I mean that the issue would
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
be this this information currently
 
00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
unless our client was to already be
 
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
filing uh voluntarily on a worldwide
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
basis in another jurisdiction we
 
00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
actually have to go through and create a
 
00:56:58.790 --> 00:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
separate federal return that we can kind
 
00:57:01.609 --> 00:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
of group into the combined report to
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
submit to the state and put in the
 
00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:06.020 align:start position:0%
combined report itself
 
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
some of the tax softwares are not the
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
kindest for some reason or another to
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire combined reporting
 
00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
it can require a lot of manual
 
00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:19.140 align:start position:0%
adjustments a lot of frustrations there
 
00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:21.059 align:start position:0%
um you know something that's commonly
 
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
worked through and then there's just
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
information gathering and kind of
 
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
looking at this depending on the number
 
00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:27.589 align:start position:0%
looking at this depending on the number
of

00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
foreign entities we're talking about
 
00:57:32.329 --> 00:57:32.339 align:start position:0%
here and entities could take different
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
forms right so we've kind of focused on
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
guilty which applies to controlled
 
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:38.339 align:start position:0%
foreign corporations we could have
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
foreign Partnerships that we have to
 
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
consider in doing reporting for them we
 
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
could have foreign disregard identities
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
LLC equivalents and the like
 
00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:48.410 align:start position:0%
LLC equivalents and the like
um

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth that would have to be
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
analyzed kind of aggregated and put
 
00:57:55.849 --> 00:57:55.859 align:start position:0%
through the return and we would need
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
more than just their you know Baseline
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
taxable income we would need
 
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
apportionment data State modifications
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
and the like so there's a lot of effort
 
00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
that goes into that workable challenge
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
but a challenge nonetheless that should
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
just be highlighted a lot of the
 
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
impediments there have already been
 
00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
discussed and they're similar to what
 
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
Keane mentioned some of them too
 
00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
currency translation we could have tax
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
year gaps right so you know you could
 
00:58:22.609 --> 00:58:22.619 align:start position:0%
have a calendar taxpayer here but they
 
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
adopt the UK of 331 or India which have
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
a non-physical non-calendar tax year in
 
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
general so dealing with issues like that
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
um the second Point here is one that I
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
kind of already referenced but
 
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
um or or maybe not who who would be in
 
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
this unitary group given that there's
 
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
not a specific identification based on
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
voter value on how we would determine
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
that that would take analysis and
 
00:58:51.359 --> 00:58:53.569 align:start position:0%
that that would take analysis and
education

00:58:53.569 --> 00:58:53.579 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:58:53.579 --> 00:58:55.309 align:start position:0%
education
um

00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:58.730 --> 00:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
uh the mandatory requirement is flagged
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
on the on the second page where the
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions that have adopted
 
00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:04.190 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions that have adopted
this

00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
um there is a ability to opt out
 
00:59:08.809 --> 00:59:08.819 align:start position:0%
um and then something I'm sure will be
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
brought up maybe this will spur it is
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the uncertainty regarding
 
00:59:17.089 --> 00:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
whether this would lead to an increase
 
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
or decrease in New Hampshire business
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
tax revenues
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
um you know we've referenced kind of
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
things that are already in the tax base
 
00:59:24.359 --> 00:59:25.569 align:start position:0%
things that are already in the tax base
and

00:59:25.569 --> 00:59:25.579 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
being affected and what would be the
 
00:59:30.289 --> 00:59:30.299 align:start position:0%
impact of this just highlighting that as
 
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
very good so I look forward to reading
 
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
this closely later on
 
00:59:42.289 --> 00:59:42.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:44.339 align:start position:0%
what I see you're really largely hitting
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
on is the huge compliance burden
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
and the uncertainty of what
 
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
this scheme would actually yield
 
00:59:57.289 --> 00:59:57.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.299 --> 00:59:58.609 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:59:58.609 --> 00:59:58.619 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:58.619 --> 01:00:02.690 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll recognize any member uh as
 
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
you wish but uh let's let's just talk
 
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
about the things that are in front of us
 
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
and and I think this last
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph in
 
01:00:16.329 --> 01:00:16.339 align:start position:0%
in your
 
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
memo Matt is worth focusing on
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to read it out loud
 
01:00:23.569 --> 01:00:23.579 align:start position:0%
it's unclear if mandatory worldwide
 
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
reporting would lead to an increase or a
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
decrease of New Hampshire business tax
 
01:00:27.359 --> 01:00:28.490 align:start position:0%
decrease of New Hampshire business tax
revenues

01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
including the income or loss of any
 
01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:32.339 align:start position:0%
unitary foreign Affiliates would also
 
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
require including worldwide
 
01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:36.299 align:start position:0%
apportionment data for those entities EG
 
01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
worldwide sales
 
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
many foreign entities would not
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
apportion much if any activity to New
 
01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:43.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but their total activity would
 
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
be included in the denominator
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
of the apportionment factors
 
01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:51.299 align:start position:0%
so in theory while more income may be
 
01:00:53.089 --> 01:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
captured in a worldwide tax return New
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire apportionment could be
 
01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
significantly diluted leading to a
 
01:00:59.569 --> 01:00:59.579 align:start position:0%
decrease in New Hampshire business tax
 
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
revenues in many instances
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to elaborate on this as I
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
and let's make this a point you know
 
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
focused conversation for for a bit
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
I was intrigued uh during our hearing
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
last week when representative Laurie
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
several times
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
postulated the hypothetical with a
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
shipyard in Scotland Shipyard in Denmark
 
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
I think the shipyards moved around and
 
01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:27.290 align:start position:0%
the different uh
 
01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:30.190 align:start position:0%
the different uh
[Music]

01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
I spent a lot of time
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I spent quite a bit of time
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about this over the past week
 
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.870 align:start position:0%
thinking about this over the past week
and

01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
I thought
 
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
perhaps the most Salient thing that I
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
read on this subject during last week I
 
01:01:50.089 --> 01:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
want to commend it to everybody even if
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
you don't get a chance to read
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
everything we've received
 
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
there were two uh write-ups from the tax
 
01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:00.770 align:start position:0%
there were two uh write-ups from the tax
Foundation

01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
um and and they took a position squarely
 
01:02:07.089 --> 01:02:07.099 align:start position:0%
opposed to worldwide combined reporting
 
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
the headline of one of them was
 
01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:12.500 align:start position:0%
something along the lines of let's leave
 
01:02:15.049 --> 01:02:15.059 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting in the 1980s where
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
it belongs so so their their Viewpoint
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
is clear but what was so striking to me
 
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
is I think
 
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
I don't want to overstate this but but
 
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
they just blew out of the water
 
01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
the estimates
 
01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.370 align:start position:0%
the estimates
um

01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
from itaps so Institute of Taxation and
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
had written an article that we received
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks ago titled a simple fix
 
01:02:59.030 --> 01:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
and it made estimates
 
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
um of the total amount quote left on the
 
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.589 align:start position:0%
um of the total amount quote left on the
table

01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the fact that none of the
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
50 states currently has the worldwide
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
combined reporting and then they
 
01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.870 align:start position:0%
combined reporting and then they
they

01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
carved that out by state and they
 
01:03:20.809 --> 01:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
assigned 177 million dollars to New
 
01:03:20.819 --> 01:03:21.710 align:start position:0%
assigned 177 million dollars to New
Hampshire

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
and that figure was mentioned by a
 
01:03:28.849 --> 01:03:28.859 align:start position:0%
number of of our presenters last week
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
but the town the tax Foundation articles
 
01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
absolutely demolish those estimates
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
there there is just simply so much flaw
 
01:03:44.809 --> 01:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
in the assumptions in the methodology
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
that the figure is not credible and and
 
01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:49.140 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm asserting this is my
 
01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
personal opinion but that 177 million
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
dollar estimate is just simply not
 
01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
supportable not workable
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
so I think it means that we remain in
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
the dark
 
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
in speculating what theoretically we
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
could gain
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
what the tax Foundation articles really
 
01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:11.870 align:start position:0%
what the tax Foundation articles really
highlight

01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
highlight
 
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
is that the fundamental flaw
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
is that we use formulary apportionment
 
01:04:23.329 --> 01:04:23.339 align:start position:0%
so the United States IRS use our uses
 
01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
arm's length separate entity filing
 
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
and it's only the states that have
 
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
decided to use combined reporting
 
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
albeit Limited at the water's edge
 
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
who are using the formulary
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
apportionment and and this has just been
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
highlighted minutes ago by
 
01:04:43.849 --> 01:04:43.859 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg and Mr Cool
 
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
broth we're only at the very very
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
beginning stages of having changed our
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
own apportionment from three factor to
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor
 
01:04:55.849 --> 01:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
so here we are
 
01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
with a business tax that as of this past
 
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:00.170 align:start position:0%
with a business tax that as of this past
year

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
only looks at sales activity
 
01:05:08.809 --> 01:05:08.819 align:start position:0%
so what does apportionment involve if we
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
have worldwide combined reporting it
 
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
it's just as Mr Foley's memo says here
 
01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
it draws in all of this activity from
 
01:05:19.809 --> 01:05:19.819 align:start position:0%
around the world
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
dramatically increasing the denominator
 
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
of a of an equation
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
but the activity being taxed is still
 
01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
the sales in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
so the form the the tax foundation for
 
01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:38.900 align:start position:0%
example uses a um
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
it it
 
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
postulates a situation where
 
01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
you have a company that's doing uh 10
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
million dollars of business here and uh
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
90 million somewhere else and
 
01:05:58.609 --> 01:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know you bring in all of the
 
01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:02.180 align:start position:0%
worldwide activity
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
but now your denominator explodes by 10
 
01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.770 align:start position:0%
but now your denominator explodes by 10
times

01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
and you're basically taxing a lot of
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
activity that occurs somewhere else in
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
the world
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
under completely different circumstances
 
01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
um under different rates
 
01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
so I it it strikes me
 
01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:23.329 align:start position:0%
so I it it strikes me
um

01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:23.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
that it distorts the equation
 
01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:28.190 align:start position:0%
that it distorts the equation
drastically

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
um that is Mr cool bro suggested a few
 
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
minutes ago there will be winners and
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
losers and and we won't know in advance
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
who's going to win and who's going to
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
lose and in fact the company that wins
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
this year might lose next year
 
01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is it's going to depend
 
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
just like representative already
 
01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
um suggested
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
on how their profits are doing
 
01:06:55.809 --> 01:06:55.819 align:start position:0%
relatively speaking somewhere else
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
and if their profits were lower
 
01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
Elsewhere on average or in the aggregate
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
than New Hampshire it will actually take
 
01:07:04.319 --> 01:07:05.150 align:start position:0%
than New Hampshire it will actually take
their

01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
tax liability to New Hampshire down
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
and if their profits were greater
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
somewhere else it takes them up
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
but there's like no Rhyme or Reason and
 
01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is when you look at what
 
01:07:19.609 --> 01:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
the impact is it has nothing to do with
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
what's going on in New Hampshire
 
01:07:27.289 --> 01:07:27.299 align:start position:0%
so I I think at the very least
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
this handicaps us and any of these
 
01:07:30.359 --> 01:07:31.609 align:start position:0%
this handicaps us and any of these
estimates

01:07:31.609 --> 01:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
that have been made that we've seen
 
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
specifically the one by itep
 
01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:38.029 align:start position:0%
specifically the one by itep
um

01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
this simply should not be considered too
 
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
flawed and and I would I would again I
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
would suggest you read those two
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
articles carefully not so much for the
 
01:07:49.559 --> 01:07:50.470 align:start position:0%
articles carefully not so much for the
the the

01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.370 align:start position:0%
the the
position

01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:07:55.849 --> 01:07:55.859 align:start position:0%
before their assessment of the math and
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:06.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.059 --> 01:08:07.670 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:10.220 align:start position:0%
I sort of disagree with your
 
01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
assessment not yours their assessment
 
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
because they provide no other
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
methodology how they performed their
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
assessment other than making General
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
generalized statements
 
01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.809 align:start position:0%
generalized statements
uh

01:08:26.809 --> 01:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
they have undertaken
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
as the methodology of the itep did in
 
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
2019 may not agree with the 177 and it
 
01:08:44.209 --> 01:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit High
 
01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
but someone
 
01:08:49.849 --> 01:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
is not paying their full tax liability
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
and from the fact Coalition of uh out of
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
Washington DC
 
01:08:59.570 --> 01:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill uh 638 that was just
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
recently passed by the
 
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate the house and signed by the
 
01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:06.430 align:start position:0%
the Senate the house and signed by the
president

01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
president
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
requires the large multinationals began
 
01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
country by country reporting of tax and
 
01:09:14.209 --> 01:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
operational data to the Securities and
 
01:09:16.249 --> 01:09:16.259 align:start position:0%
Exchange Commission
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
and the reason for this is that there
 
01:09:20.829 --> 01:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
are investors
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
public reporting that is needed for
 
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
people to know on the boards and people
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
that are investing
 
01:09:31.849 --> 01:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
what are is the true picture of your
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
I bring up
 
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
this 177 million may not be much
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
in the eyes of
 
01:09:47.329 --> 01:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
certain people in New Hampshire
 
01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
but when audits were done like in the
 
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
McDonald Corporation in France
 
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
they ended up having to pay 1.3 billion
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
dollars to settle their allegations of
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing and if you go to uh
 
01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
the U.S Tax Court ruled that
 
01:10:08.689 --> 01:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
in this country
 
01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
that Coca-Cola used profit shifting to
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
underpay 3.3 billion dollars from 2007
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
to 2009.
 
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
and when they corrected the pricing
 
01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
practices they resolve the company
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
facing a possible 14 billion in
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
additional liability
 
01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.729 align:start position:0%
additional liability
so

01:10:28.729 --> 01:10:28.739 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
someone has done studies
 
01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
this 177 million dollars
 
01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
didn't they didn't show a methodology
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
they just took comparisons using
 
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
generalized terms I believe
 
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
I don't think they
 
01:10:56.410 --> 01:10:56.420 align:start position:0%
well not not to to debate
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
your exact point but
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
tax Foundation did not undertake to make
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
so there was no methodology that they
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
proposed to follow that would allow for
 
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
an estimate in fact I think that they
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
probably I don't think they stated this
 
01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
but I suspect if you ask them they would
 
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
say it's futile
 
01:11:25.450 --> 01:11:25.460 align:start position:0%
what they did do though very effectively
 
01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:27.189 align:start position:0%
what they did do though very effectively
is

01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
undermine the methodology that leads to
 
01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
the 177 million the 177 million is
 
01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
so I I think that leaves us in a
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
predicament where
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
we have no way to estimate what the
 
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
consequences would be of implementing
 
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting
 
01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
it's an assumption that it would improve
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's revenues
 
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:11:59.689 --> 01:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
yes representative Oliver
 
01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
in and I haven't done as deep a dive as
 
01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
I would like into both of the articles
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
but from the surface the
 
01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
the question that comes to mind is
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
you can only tax her entity whether it's
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
a human being or a corporate entity so
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
much before they just say
 
01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
they give them throw up their hands and
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
say we're not going to play this game
 
01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
if we cannot
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
reimburse our investors
 
01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
and make it profitable for them to give
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
us money which is where their growth
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
comes from is from people investing in
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
it and getting a return on investment I
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
mean they even have an acronym for an
 
01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.510 align:start position:0%
mean they even have an acronym for an
Roi

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
in my mind
 
01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.390 align:start position:0%
in my mind
doesn't

01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
use a cliche over tax a business to the
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
point where it would just say
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
we've got some Nexus here uh territory
 
01:13:03.719 --> 01:13:04.970 align:start position:0%
we've got some Nexus here uh territory
now

01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have it anymore
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of a a manufacturer over in
 
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
the uh Cheshire county that decided
 
01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
rather than expanding in New Hampshire
 
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
not just because of taxes but for other
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
causes as well
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
um he was going there they that the
 
01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:27.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
I know of another manufacturer over
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
towards the Seacoast area that did the
 
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
same thing we've had this happen Time
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
and Time and Time and Time and Time
 
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:37.910 align:start position:0%
and Time and Time and Time and Time
Again

01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
Again
 
01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:41.219 align:start position:0%
where people have left here
 
01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
which brings me back to the question
 
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
that I asked to Wong earlier regarding
 
01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
the amount of Revenue derived from our
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
tax base over time as to show when it
 
01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
was low when it was high and what and
 
01:13:58.970 --> 01:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
we've discussed uh with uh
 
01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
Mr spilsberry the
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:10.729 --> 01:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
I'm just a little concerned
 
01:14:10.739 --> 01:14:12.110 align:start position:0%
I'm just a little concerned
that

01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
we're getting into a position where
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
implementing this
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
May wind up
 
01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
making the tax rate so high
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
that we get
 
01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
an initial
 
01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
plus an initial Rush of money coming in
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
and then saying well you got some Bank
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
of property on this street you got some
 
01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
vacant property on that street you got
 
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
some vacant property over
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
in Litchfield right now which is going
 
01:14:42.649 --> 01:14:42.659 align:start position:0%
to be housing
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
I just I'm really concerned about over
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
taxation of an individual because you
 
01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
can you can and there's
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
plenty of economic proof to this you can
 
01:14:59.330 --> 01:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
uh we can go back to the Laffer Curve
 
01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
but you know you get more income here
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
than you do you get tax at 100 you get
 
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
zero Revenue you tax it zero percent you
 
01:15:10.729 --> 01:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
get zero Revenue somewhere in between
 
01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:12.229 align:start position:0%
get zero Revenue somewhere in between
there

01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:15:18.649 --> 01:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
may I respond they're just yes no yes I
 
01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
don't think we're talking tax or I think
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're talking
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
tax rate I think we're talking your tax
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
liability are you
 
01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
are you paying your fair share
 
01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:40.490 align:start position:0%
are you paying your fair share
of

01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:42.380 align:start position:0%
what you have done in New Hampshire
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire has provided
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it's provided you
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
know educated worker right that's where
 
01:15:53.209 --> 01:15:53.219 align:start position:0%
I think that we should be looking tax
 
01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
rates are things that we can debate in
 
01:15:57.050 --> 01:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:59.149 align:start position:0%
ways and means
which

01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
but this is more of a
 
01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
what is the tax liberal is it a fair
 
01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
tax policy you presently have that is
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
the question and
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
I think that we're
 
01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be in this if we and Senator
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
no uh
 
01:16:20.689 --> 01:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
disrespect your
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall there but but
 
01:16:25.729 --> 01:16:25.739 align:start position:0%
when they the wall in this room when
 
01:16:27.290 --> 01:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
they went on the single sales Factor
 
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
without a study without putting it forth
 
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
for us to look at for the next four or
 
01:16:33.649 --> 01:16:33.659 align:start position:0%
five years
 
01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
to draw these numbers together and see
 
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
what is best do we walk away from our by
 
01:16:44.450 --> 01:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
fruitcated uh approach of sales and
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
payroll and without any data
 
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
but the vast part that bothers me and if
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
we had that
 
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
we may not be pushing as hard on this
 
01:16:56.090 --> 01:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
I just got a feeling that single sales
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
affect our our Revenue because it's
 
01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
sales within the state
 
01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
going out so if I can pull a theme out
 
01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
of both your comments
 
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
so there's no question even if it's
 
01:17:23.770 --> 01:17:23.780 align:start position:0%
purely a theoretical uh point that
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
taxation at the margin at some point
 
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
will affect Behavior
 
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
Behavior can be affected in a whole
 
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
variety of ways one end of the spectrum
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
increasing your investment in New
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to the other end of the
 
01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
spectrum pulling out of New Hampshire
 
01:17:42.649 --> 01:17:42.659 align:start position:0%
all together
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
and a vast array of decisions in between
 
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
so the rate I agree
 
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
um that's one variable
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
in the equation of tax burden how you
 
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
define the base the tax base is really
 
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
what we're focused on in this commission
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
and that's another variable
 
01:18:06.490 --> 01:18:06.500 align:start position:0%
but I think that representative ulery
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
has raised a question it's I suppose
 
01:18:12.649 --> 01:18:12.659 align:start position:0%
ultimately a judgment call because we
 
01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
again we don't have the ability to
 
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
quantify at what point
 
01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
people will react adversely but
 
01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
the fundamental purpose of Taxation is
 
01:18:26.689 --> 01:18:26.699 align:start position:0%
to fund the basic needs of government
 
01:18:29.209 --> 01:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
and that's a calibration and a judgment
 
01:18:29.219 --> 01:18:30.130 align:start position:0%
and that's a calibration and a judgment
call

01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:30.140 align:start position:0%
call
 
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
that on the other side of the equation
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
requires policy decisions about how far
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
you go in taxation
 
01:18:37.199 --> 01:18:38.810 align:start position:0%
you go in taxation
and

01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:42.169 --> 01:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
soaking the taxpayer isn't always the
 
01:18:42.179 --> 01:18:43.390 align:start position:0%
soaking the taxpayer isn't always the
ideal

01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
ideal
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
answer because you can easily find maybe
 
01:18:50.689 --> 01:18:50.699 align:start position:0%
after the fact that you were Beyond uh
 
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
you know the point of diminishing
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
returns so I I do think that lurking
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
behind everything we discuss in this
 
01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:58.270 align:start position:0%
behind everything we discuss in this
Commission

01:18:58.270 --> 01:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
is a judgment call on tax policy whether
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
trying to expand the base
 
01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
in ways that are burdensome and complex
 
01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:15.659 align:start position:0%
and unquantifiable and uncertain is a
 
01:19:17.209 --> 01:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
wise idea
 
01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
that certainly is you know what I'm
 
01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
trying to distill virtually all of our
 
01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
discussion down to
 
01:19:27.169 --> 01:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
so others
 
01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:28.490 align:start position:0%
so others
Kennedy

01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
Kennedy
 
01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
um so relative to we we had a
 
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
presentation that the New Hampshire
 
01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
taxation of guilty and I know keep kind
 
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
of coming back to this but is kind of
 
01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
unique across the the states
 
01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:44.570 align:start position:0%
unique across the the states
and

01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
when we discuss the guilty tax the
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
current taxation of guilty in New
 
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would presumably go away if we
 
01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:56.219 align:start position:0%
went to a worldwide reporting so we have
 
01:19:58.370 --> 01:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
a potentially known quantity in the
 
01:19:58.380 --> 01:19:59.110 align:start position:0%
a potentially known quantity in the
future

01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
that'll tell us how much taxation is
 
01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:04.739 align:start position:0%
being generated from the guilty income
 
01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire taxes versus the
 
01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:10.820 align:start position:0%
unknown that would come from
 
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
the new apportionment where an increased
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
denominator that we don't know the
 
01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.590 align:start position:0%
denominator that we don't know the
results

01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
results
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
um the other item and I'd ask this
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
question is the concern that
 
01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:25.490 align:start position:0%
question is the concern that
um

01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
local businesses are paying a higher
 
01:20:30.189 --> 01:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
percentage of the base
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
is because in theory the
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
entities that have foreign corporations
 
01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
are shifting that profit overseas by
 
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
means of taking a cost deduction here in
 
01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
the U.S and the profit going and the
 
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
revenue going over to overseas and
 
01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
whether or not the a potential
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
alternative approach would be to look at
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
the transfer pricing issues and having
 
01:20:58.450 --> 01:20:58.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire address that specifically
 
01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
for domestic companies that are paying
 
01:21:05.649 --> 01:21:05.659 align:start position:0%
their foreign subsidiaries to reduce
 
01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
their profit profit here in the in New
 
01:21:11.689 --> 01:21:11.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which may be a s in my thought
 
01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
would be a simpler means of addressing
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
those entities that are shifting their
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
profits overseas without converting
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
everybody to worldwide reporting with
 
01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
the additional risk that we don't know
 
01:21:25.970 --> 01:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
how that increased denominator is going
 
01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:29.300 align:start position:0%
to affect the revenue stream
 
01:21:32.630 --> 01:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
and on something of a slightly off-topic
 
01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.510 align:start position:0%
and on something of a slightly off-topic
item

01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
item
 
01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:36.860 align:start position:0%
though those still
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
kind of pertinent in terms of the bills
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I haven't I don't recall the bills
 
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
that are in place to move to worldwide
 
01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:47.219 align:start position:0%
reporting but the my understanding is
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
the theory by moving to worldwide
 
01:21:51.649 --> 01:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
reporting is that these entities that
 
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
are not just local but are foreign would
 
01:21:57.410 --> 01:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
have a higher base and pay additional
 
01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
taxes but I haven't yet heard how does
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
this save the the domestic smaller
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
businesses from paying more taxes is
 
01:22:09.169 --> 01:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
there something in the bill that says if
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
we reach certain Revenue levels that the
 
01:22:13.130 --> 01:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
business profit tax rate would go down
 
01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
how how do local businesses domestic
 
01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
businesses without foreign entities
 
01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
actually receive a benefit if we were to
 
01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
move to worldwide reporting and I'm
 
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
unclear as to how the the folks that
 
01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
have said well we're paying too much but
 
01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen how do they pay less if
 
01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
we move to worldwide reporting how does
 
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
very good question
 
01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:39.350 align:start position:0%
very good question
um

01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
I was wondering and I respect completely
 
01:22:44.930 --> 01:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to apply anything else
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
our Our Testimony a week ago from a
 
01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
painting contractor left me wondering
 
01:22:53.209 --> 01:22:53.219 align:start position:0%
how does doing this or not doing this
 
01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
change the tax bill of a painting
 
01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:56.590 align:start position:0%
change the tax bill of a painting
contractor

01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
you know maybe there is some level at
 
01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
which a new york-based business is in
 
01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:05.699 align:start position:0%
direct competition
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
with a foreign-based A supplier of the
 
01:23:12.290 --> 01:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
same product or service and finds
 
01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
himself in some kind of a direct
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
competitive disadvantage but from the
 
01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
standpoint of smaller businesses that
 
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
are not directly competing I just don't
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
see that and from the standpoint of
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
mitigating their tax bill or changing
 
01:23:29.689 --> 01:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
their own company's internal
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
um you know p l
 
01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
I don't see it so I I think you've
 
01:23:35.930 --> 01:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
raised an extremely good question I
 
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.209 --> 01:23:44.219 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg yes Mr chairman
 
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
it's more of
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
a moral issue here that we're saying
 
01:23:59.630 --> 01:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
those that are in a BPT class those that
 
01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:03.250 align:start position:0%
those that are in a BPT class those that
companies

01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:03.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
some of those companies are able to use
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
accounting procedures for transfer
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%
pricing that
 
01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
the domestic companies
 
01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
can't use and if you're in that same
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
class you should be treated you should
 
01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
be able to use the same techniques the
 
01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
same tools
 
01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:24.050 align:start position:0%
same tools
that

01:24:24.050 --> 01:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
the others are using uh
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
I I sort of agree with you on the
 
01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
transfer of pricing it's something that
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
that that is has not been I say
 
01:24:37.550 --> 01:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
challenged by this
 
01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
to try to bring
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
a more equalized approach to this but
 
01:24:48.110 --> 01:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
it's more of a moral issue here the tax
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
policy should be
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
in a class should be the same and it's
 
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
not it's legal what what is being done
 
01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
there is no question about that but by
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
the multinationals and there are
 
01:25:02.090 --> 01:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
accounting departments and if you're a
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
an accountant you better be getting your
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
company the best deal they can get by
 
01:25:09.169 --> 01:25:09.179 align:start position:0%
using the what is there I have no
 
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
problem with that but
 
01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
those that are within there shouldn't be
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
excluded if just because they're
 
01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:15.770 align:start position:0%
excluded if just because they're
domestic

01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
domestic
 
01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:17.810 align:start position:0%
domestic
and

01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
I find it very hard
 
01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
to say that uh
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
the reason
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
they're paying more
 
01:25:32.209 --> 01:25:32.219 align:start position:0%
in their tax liability is because
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
the others have been able to reduce
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
theirs with methods that the domestic
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.370 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:46.130 --> 01:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
I think we can all stipulate the
 
01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing exists
 
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
and transfer pricing is particularly
 
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
available when it comes to intangibles
 
01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.629 align:start position:0%
available when it comes to intangibles
like

01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
patent writes and Licensing fees and and
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth it exists if you
 
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
study that subject you find that there's
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
a vast array
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
of perfectly normal customary sound
 
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
Business Pack practices to support
 
01:26:19.209 --> 01:26:19.219 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing
 
01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
and and to make sure that the costs of
 
01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:23.270 align:start position:0%
and and to make sure that the costs of
having

01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:24.490 align:start position:0%
having
[Music]

01:26:24.490 --> 01:26:24.500 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
invested a huge amount on R D and and
 
01:26:30.669 --> 01:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
developing protection and so on
 
01:26:34.209 --> 01:26:34.219 align:start position:0%
is is shared across various entities so
 
01:26:36.169 --> 01:26:36.179 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals devised in the United
 
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
States that are later sold worldwide for
 
01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:39.890 align:start position:0%
States that are later sold worldwide for
example

01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
the question again unmeasurable
 
01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:47.219 align:start position:0%
is to what extent have these transfer
 
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
pricing tools
 
01:26:53.689 --> 01:26:53.699 align:start position:0%
been used in an abusive way abusive as
 
01:26:57.229 --> 01:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
we might Define it being to minimize
 
01:26:57.239 --> 01:26:59.510 align:start position:0%
we might Define it being to minimize
taxes

01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
um I think that the conundrum for any
 
01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:03.610 align:start position:0%
um I think that the conundrum for any
state

01:27:03.610 --> 01:27:03.620 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
especially this would be true for New
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if it's the first and only
 
01:27:12.169 --> 01:27:12.179 align:start position:0%
state going back to worldwide combined
 
01:27:12.179 --> 01:27:13.310 align:start position:0%
state going back to worldwide combined
reporting

01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
is that we don't have the the apparatus
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the federal tax code or the IRS
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
working with us
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
as Keen as pointed out starting point
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
for a BPT filing is the federal tax
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
return but the further that New
 
01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Strays away from the federal
 
01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
model the less that that's true the more
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
supplemental filings and and adjustments
 
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
have to be made
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
which again increases the audit of
 
01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:47.330 align:start position:0%
which again increases the audit of
Burden

01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
Burden
 
01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
if the this is not a preemption
 
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
um matter we we know that the federal
 
01:27:59.090 --> 01:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
Congress has not preempted and that
 
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
legally we could do this if we thought
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
it was the right thing to do
 
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
but when you don't have the federal
 
01:28:08.209 --> 01:28:08.219 align:start position:0%
government going down this
 
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
you got to ask yourself what are the
 
01:28:14.090 --> 01:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
reasons why the federal government isn't
 
01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:15.490 align:start position:0%
reasons why the federal government isn't
chasing

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:15.500 align:start position:0%
chasing
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
this Revenue quote left on the table in
 
01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
the way that we're contemplating doing
 
01:28:24.649 --> 01:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
it and and I think I think if you dig
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
into that what you find is that
 
01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
the federal government isn't chasing
 
01:28:34.030 --> 01:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue left on the table using this
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
particular method
 
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
but look what has happened there have
 
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
been International negotiations there is
 
01:28:48.010 --> 01:28:48.020 align:start position:0%
a proposal that has not yet coalesced
 
01:28:51.649 --> 01:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
to have a 15 worldwide minimum corporate
 
01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
tax strong arguments in favor strong
 
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
arguments against but but that is
 
01:28:58.129 --> 01:28:58.139 align:start position:0%
motivated in large part
 
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
for similar reasons
 
01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.750 align:start position:0%
for similar reasons
the

01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
the night the 2017 tax cuts and jobs Act
 
01:29:09.530 --> 01:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
included a number of steps it
 
01:29:11.209 --> 01:29:11.219 align:start position:0%
implemented the guilty that we've been
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
talking about over again
 
01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
it includes beat base erosion and
 
01:29:18.530 --> 01:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
anti-abuse tax
 
01:29:21.649 --> 01:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
it included the mandatory repatriation
 
01:29:21.659 --> 01:29:23.330 align:start position:0%
it included the mandatory repatriation
tax

01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
and here we sit in New Hampshire having
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
gone to single sales Factor but we also
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
tax guilty relative to the other states
 
01:29:35.050 --> 01:29:35.060 align:start position:0%
aggressively at 50 percent
 
01:29:40.189 --> 01:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
and and simultaneously we tax the
 
01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
foreign dividend sources
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
so there are a whole array
 
01:29:49.490 --> 01:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
of different efforts
 
01:29:52.129 --> 01:29:52.139 align:start position:0%
to try and mitigate against the tendency
 
01:29:55.129 --> 01:29:55.139 align:start position:0%
that might exist to use transfer pricing
 
01:29:58.970 --> 01:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
or abusive tax avoidance purposes
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
and I just I think we should take stock
 
01:30:04.850 --> 01:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
of the various ways in which the federal
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
government has tried to move in this
 
01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
direction and ask ourselves why did they
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
never take the date to go to worldwide
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
just a little counter yes absolutely I I
 
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
called for a robust discussion today so
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
let's have it we've asked the question
 
01:30:26.930 --> 01:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
you know why
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
did our government why has it not
 
01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
well it's the one that initiated it
 
01:30:37.129 --> 01:30:37.139 align:start position:0%
by the secret agreement between Margaret
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
Thatcher and President Reagan at the
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
White House and you did receive that
 
01:30:42.239 --> 01:30:43.970 align:start position:0%
White House and you did receive that
study

01:30:43.970 --> 01:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:46.310 align:start position:0%
study
uh

01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
in your can I just clarify that
 
01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:50.890 align:start position:0%
in your can I just clarify that
the

01:30:50.890 --> 01:30:50.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:52.870 align:start position:0%
the
yeah

01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
this is the secret I I just want to make
 
01:30:57.950 --> 01:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
sure that we're characterizing this
 
01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
letter correctly I've read it so the
 
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
letter from Ronald Reagan to Margaret
 
01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:03.729 align:start position:0%
letter from Ronald Reagan to Margaret
Thatcher

01:31:03.729 --> 01:31:03.739 align:start position:0%
Thatcher
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
says we're going to create a worldwide
 
01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
unitary tax working group
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
to try to persuade the state's not to
 
01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.229 align:start position:0%
to try to persuade the state's not to
implement

01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
implement
 
01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:17.699 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting
 
01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
but rather at most
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
to adopt the water's edge limit
 
01:31:26.209 --> 01:31:26.219 align:start position:0%
so the secret agreement is as you're
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
characterizing it is just simply a
 
01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:29.270 align:start position:0%
characterizing it is just simply a
letter

01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
letter
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
that says
 
01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
the U.S government is not going to
 
01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
implement uh combined worldwide
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
reporting and we're going to dissuade
 
01:31:39.649 --> 01:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
any of the States from doing it and
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask those states that
 
01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
have adopted it to unwind it and they
 
01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.890 align:start position:0%
have adopted it to unwind it and they
succeeded

01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:45.900 align:start position:0%
succeeded
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
promises that the federal government
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
would assist the States
 
01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
with their
 
01:31:55.729 --> 01:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
ability to get the information they need
 
01:31:58.250 --> 01:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
for their tax policies and the working
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
group did not come down and apply that
 
01:32:04.129 --> 01:32:04.139 align:start position:0%
to the state of New Hampshire can can
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
you elaborate on what those promises
 
01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:06.530 align:start position:0%
you elaborate on what those promises
were

01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm the one what the promises
 
01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:10.270 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm the one what the promises
were

01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's in my
 
01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
yes representative Valerie
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
just one word Secret
 
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
everything every president does a secret
 
01:32:33.649 --> 01:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
well for 20 years all right so uh but
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
point is the federal government wanted
 
01:32:41.450 --> 01:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
to change because of outside influences
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
not within the country but outside the
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
foreign Nationals wanted some change to
 
01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.110 align:start position:0%
foreign Nationals wanted some change to
protect

01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
protect
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%
a certain party in England in their
 
01:32:51.719 --> 01:32:52.850 align:start position:0%
a certain party in England in their
Investments

01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
that go throughout the world
 
01:32:57.370 --> 01:32:57.380 align:start position:0%
the royalty
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
the king and queen of England and that
 
01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
was a start
 
01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:04.850 align:start position:0%
was a start
and

01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:12.169 --> 01:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
I think that we have put ourselves in a
 
01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
position because of
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
political I don't want to say this
 
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
political promises that that maybe would
 
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
come down the line if State of New
 
01:33:23.229 --> 01:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were to step away from
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting to various political
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
individuals that were in the state at
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
the time
 
01:33:32.410 --> 01:33:32.420 align:start position:0%
I think there were future
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
possibility of positions within the
 
01:33:35.629 --> 01:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
which a uh coroner office was looking at
 
01:33:41.629 --> 01:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
to try to uh
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
yes to try to
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
this was passed
 
01:33:49.679 --> 01:33:51.110 align:start position:0%
this was passed
and

01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
in my study that I did and wrote about
 
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:33:59.810 --> 01:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
dra came forth and pushed this
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
as the
 
01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
force that needed to say we needed a
 
01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.209 align:start position:0%
force that needed to say we needed a
change

01:34:05.209 --> 01:34:05.219 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:34:05.219 --> 01:34:07.970 align:start position:0%
change
and

01:34:07.970 --> 01:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
it was not something that
 
01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.750 align:start position:0%
it was not something that
the

01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:14.530 --> 01:34:14.540 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee at the time was
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
looking to enact
 
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
there was a question by uh the
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Jones I believe Robert
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
Jones that said
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
we want to get the tax that is required
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
no more no less
 
01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
but he worried about the
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of it and then the
 
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
corner office came in and said we need
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
to do this we need to do this for the
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire to get
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
Investments and things we were getting
 
01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:41.229 align:start position:0%
Investments and things we were getting
Investments

01:34:41.229 --> 01:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's just a a political approach that
 
01:34:47.209 --> 01:34:47.219 align:start position:0%
someone made a promise to somebody else
 
01:34:49.610 --> 01:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason we're at this
 
01:34:51.649 --> 01:34:51.659 align:start position:0%
position now that I have brought this
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
back to try to get a fair level of time
 
01:34:57.649 --> 01:34:57.659 align:start position:0%
ironically I was actually involved
 
01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
um yes so in 1993 as an associate
 
01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
attorney with Wilmer Cutler and
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
Pickering I
 
01:35:07.129 --> 01:35:07.139 align:start position:0%
became a
 
01:35:09.530 --> 01:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
admitted to the Supreme Court bar and
 
01:35:12.169 --> 01:35:12.179 align:start position:0%
participated in writing an amicus carry
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
a brief
 
01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:15.179 align:start position:0%
in the case that went to the Supreme
 
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
Court on this subject and
 
01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:21.659 align:start position:0%
there is no question whatsoever if you
 
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
go back and look through the record that
 
01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:24.590 align:start position:0%
go back and look through the record that
Congress

01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
did not want a federal
 
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
combined worldwide reporting law and the
 
01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:34.739 align:start position:0%
question of preemption that was framed
 
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
in the case was whether the Commerce
 
01:35:41.290 --> 01:35:41.300 align:start position:0%
Clause somehow preempted California from
 
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
implementing worldwide combined
 
01:35:45.770 --> 01:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
reporting even though Congress had not
 
01:35:47.689 --> 01:35:47.699 align:start position:0%
taken affirmative action
 
01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
and the Supreme Court determined that it
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
was not and the California was free to
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead so the irony
 
01:35:57.649 --> 01:35:57.659 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
just after the Supreme Court
 
01:36:03.649 --> 01:36:03.659 align:start position:0%
cleared the path for California to
 
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
implement combined World reporting there
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
was a sea change on the policy side
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
and all of the states largely
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
participating in the worldwide unitary
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
tax working group
 
01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
which included
 
01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:19.430 align:start position:0%
which included
[Music]

01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
you know quite an array in
 
01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
a State Legislative representative some
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
Governors and so on there was a sea
 
01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
change back away from it so very very
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
ironic it's an unusual example of the
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
clear something that's controversial
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
and no sooner is the ink dry then the
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
states start pulling back including New
 
01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:47.510 align:start position:0%
states start pulling back including New
Hampshire

01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
so I think that the notion that there
 
01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
was just a political agreement to
 
01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
appease Britain
 
01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:58.129 align:start position:0%
appease Britain
um

01:36:58.129 --> 01:36:58.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
misses the overwhelming scene that was
 
01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
well the the former commissioner Lloyd
 
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
Price at the time and then Everett
 
01:37:14.209 --> 01:37:14.219 align:start position:0%
Taylor who was the dra commissioner at
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
the price says
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
he stated that in his administration now
 
01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
in 1986 he was not the commissioner
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
anymore he was I don't know where he was
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
moved to but he was not the commissioner
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
because in 1983 he wrote some statements
 
01:37:30.239 --> 01:37:31.129 align:start position:0%
because in 1983 he wrote some statements
that

01:37:31.129 --> 01:37:31.139 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
he would not step away from worldwide
 
01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
reporting but he testified that the
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
administration right or wrong or
 
01:37:39.110 --> 01:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
indifferent never his administration
 
01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:40.370 align:start position:0%
indifferent never his administration
didn't

01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:37:43.129 --> 01:37:43.139 align:start position:0%
never did go totally worldwide we never
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
did foreign tax dividends from foreign
 
01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
parents I mean we never taxed foreign
 
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
parents okay even though California did
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
he added that if he were a tax
 
01:37:55.129 --> 01:37:55.139 align:start position:0%
administrator in a business he would
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
make sure I shift all of the income and
 
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
profits to the foreign parents we know
 
01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
as we sit in this room there are certain
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
corporations who shift their income to
 
01:38:08.330 --> 01:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
states that do not and this at the time
 
01:38:10.970 --> 01:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
to states that do not have a business
 
01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:12.410 align:start position:0%
to states that do not have a business
tax

01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:38:14.810 --> 01:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
and then ever Terror Taylor followed up
 
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
with he agreed with the testimony and
 
01:38:18.649 --> 01:38:18.659 align:start position:0%
that if you do anything other than
 
01:38:20.330 --> 01:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
unitary in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
you're going to destroy the tax base he
 
01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
said he believed that the business
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
Community would probably want to go to
 
01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
single accounting if you do that there
 
01:38:32.090 --> 01:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
is going to be an awful lot of profit
 
01:38:34.490 --> 01:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
being siphoned out of the state
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
we had experts that were trying to tell
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
us back then that
 
01:38:41.930 --> 01:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:43.669 align:start position:0%
there is
Revenue

01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
being siphoned out of this state
 
01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
I I believe that
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
political pressure was still very strong
 
01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:53.530 align:start position:0%
political pressure was still very strong
then

01:38:53.530 --> 01:38:53.540 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:38:56.890 --> 01:38:56.900 align:start position:0%
on why they came to go into
 
01:38:59.629 --> 01:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
Water's Edge
 
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
so it's a 40 nearly 40 year old
 
01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
discussion and I would stipulate that
 
01:39:10.129 --> 01:39:10.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
if if we're ready to acknowledge that
 
01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
there is revenue given away it still
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
begs the question
 
01:39:18.890 --> 01:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
whether it's sufficient enough
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
that it's worth
 
01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
the becoming an outlier
 
01:39:27.229 --> 01:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
running our tax system differently than
 
01:39:28.490 --> 01:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
any other state or the federal
 
01:39:30.649 --> 01:39:30.659 align:start position:0%
government or the rest of the world
 
01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
and enduring the complexity and the
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
burden of enforcing it
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's I think the question that this
 
01:39:42.590 --> 01:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
I do not argue that point with you I
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
just argue that our taxes tax policy
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
should be Fern level
 
01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
it should be equal for all those that
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
are in that class
 
01:39:59.689 --> 01:39:59.699 align:start position:0%
and I think it's it's a moral decision
 
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
that we are going to have to make on
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:07.250 --> 01:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
as you have told me the in the past
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
representative alray we don't pick
 
01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
winners or losers but someone picked
 
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
winners and decided the other group was
 
01:40:16.970 --> 01:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
so question
 
01:40:20.689 --> 01:40:20.699 align:start position:0%
um by the way
 
01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
all members please put your hand up as
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
soon as you've got something interject
 
01:40:28.090 --> 01:40:28.100 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to dominate
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
I've seen so far apart on regular Ways
 
01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:32.210 align:start position:0%
and Means
 
01:40:32.210 --> 01:40:35.990 align:start position:0%
and Means
[Laughter]

01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.750 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
um

01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.410 --> 01:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
I think it's a huge question even if you
 
01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:44.090 align:start position:0%
I think it's a huge question even if you
stipulate

01:40:44.090 --> 01:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
stipulate
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
that transfer pricing
 
01:40:49.149 --> 01:40:49.159 align:start position:0%
is used
 
01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
to reduce tax
 
01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
and that there are ways in which that's
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
done that might be regarded as abusive
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
and might be regarded as coming at the
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
expense of the State of New Hampshire
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
for sake of discussion let's just assume
 
01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
that that's true
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
I don't see that worldwide combined
 
01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:13.129 align:start position:0%
I don't see that worldwide combined
reporting

01:41:13.129 --> 01:41:13.139 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
so let's just say that I'm the CEO of a
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
multinational corporation that has well
 
01:41:25.970 --> 01:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
the one I used to work at I was not CEO
 
01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
but we were in 76 countries
 
01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:31.070 align:start position:0%
but we were in 76 countries
so

01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:34.970 --> 01:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
you're you're in 76 countries and
 
01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:36.229 align:start position:0%
you're you're in 76 countries and
um

01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:40.850 --> 01:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
you know maybe you register your ship in
 
01:41:42.890 --> 01:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
Singapore or Panama
 
01:41:45.770 --> 01:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
and maybe you have certain marketing
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
operations out of Bermuda maybe you do
 
01:41:50.810 --> 01:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
these things because you you're running
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
a massive complex conglomerate
 
01:41:56.330 --> 01:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
you're not necessarily doing them with
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
the United States on taxes specifically
 
01:42:00.850 --> 01:42:00.860 align:start position:0%
in mind
 
01:42:05.090 --> 01:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
you got to pay taxes in 76 countries and
 
01:42:06.770 --> 01:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
you're certainly not doing it with New
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in mind and and I don't think
 
01:42:10.370 --> 01:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
the corporation I worked for was
 
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
especially complex in the in the realm
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
of large multinationals
 
01:42:20.590 --> 01:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
so how does
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
reporting the net income of 76 countries
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
do anything to address the question of
 
01:42:31.729 --> 01:42:31.739 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing
 
01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
to a so-called tax Haven Country which
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
might have been one or two or three out
 
01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
of the 76. I I I just don't even see how
 
01:42:45.649 --> 01:42:45.659 align:start position:0%
combined reporting if it was you know
 
01:42:45.659 --> 01:42:47.390 align:start position:0%
combined reporting if it was you know
implemented

01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
01:42:50.050 --> 01:42:50.060 align:start position:0%
and if it went
 
01:42:53.450 --> 01:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
smoothly without too much of an audit I
 
01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
still don't see how it recovers
 
01:42:59.810 --> 01:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
the impact of transfer pricing that one
 
01:43:02.570 --> 01:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
might characterize as abusive
 
01:43:04.850 --> 01:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
and I think if you go through those tax
 
01:43:07.850 --> 01:43:07.860 align:start position:0%
Foundation articles
 
01:43:10.729 --> 01:43:10.739 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it's going to be a real
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
crap shoot whether in a particular
 
01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
instance for a particular corporation in
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
a given Year New Hampshire gets more or
 
01:43:21.010 --> 01:43:21.020 align:start position:0%
less Mr Speaker
 
01:43:25.129 --> 01:43:25.139 align:start position:0%
if I can address that and Matt I'm sure
 
01:43:27.050 --> 01:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
will correct me if I'm a little off here
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
but when you would have a common a
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
combining of entities the related party
 
01:43:37.609 --> 01:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
transactions are usually removed during
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
the combined reporting so simply stated
 
01:43:42.410 --> 01:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
if you have a New Hampshire company
 
01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
that's paying a million dollars to a UK
 
01:43:48.290 --> 01:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
company for royalties or whatever
 
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
and those uh entity information is then
 
01:43:54.530 --> 01:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
combined there would be an eliminating
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
entry to remove the transfer pricing
 
01:44:00.590 --> 01:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
cost to New Hampshire and the income at
 
01:44:03.410 --> 01:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
the UK level so the transfer pricing
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
activity I'm presuming would largely go
 
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
away as a factor here makes sense it
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
neutralizes it becomes a wash and then
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
it what comes into play Then is the
 
01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
apportionment issue which is how much
 
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
were sales and uh as you were talking
 
01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
you made me think of another level of
 
01:44:24.169 --> 01:44:24.179 align:start position:0%
complexity relative to sales we've
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
recently moved to single sales a few
 
01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
years ago we've more recently moved to
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
Market based sourcing which simply
 
01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:36.179 align:start position:0%
stated is a theory in which instead of
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
the cost of performance which is where
 
01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
people are doing the work the sale is
 
01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
allocated to the state or in this case
 
01:44:47.770 --> 01:44:47.780 align:start position:0%
potentially the foreign entity where
 
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the service or the item
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
is received and this gets very very
 
01:44:57.410 --> 01:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
complex many states have moved over to
 
01:44:59.090 --> 01:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
this in New Hampshire recently took it
 
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
on in 2022 I think is when it was
 
01:45:05.689 --> 01:45:05.699 align:start position:0%
implemented 22 21 21 thank you I better
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
go back and get my 21 returns one year
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
before the single sales fact
 
01:45:13.689 --> 01:45:13.699 align:start position:0%
um that's right so um
 
01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
that's very complex especially when you
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
get into say intangible items or where
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
who the benefit who's receiving the
 
01:45:23.570 --> 01:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
benefit where is the that place which
 
01:45:26.450 --> 01:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
again not only complicates it but in
 
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
trying to identify is New Hampshire
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
um is it New Hampshire that is receiving
 
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
the benefit of this it's possible that
 
01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
it would further dilute increase the
 
01:45:39.729 --> 01:45:39.739 align:start position:0%
denominator or dilute the new the
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
numerator for New Hampshire because
 
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
maybe it's the and I don't really know
 
01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
how it would work in theory but a I
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
think it's more complex but I think
 
01:45:52.129 --> 01:45:52.139 align:start position:0%
potentially for these foreign countries
 
01:45:54.669 --> 01:45:54.679 align:start position:0%
especially the ones that are foreign
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
foreign entities that own U.S companies
 
01:45:58.970 --> 01:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
you might say well the benefit is
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
received entirely overseas for
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing when that is
 
01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
applicable which again means that New
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is actually maybe losing that
 
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
some of that U.S revenue and I have no
 
01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
idea where the numbers would fall but I
 
01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
certainly think it's something to
 
01:46:17.090 --> 01:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
consider in the process of of another
 
01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
unknown well
 
01:46:21.530 --> 01:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
really great comments and I think you're
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
you're highlighting another thing that
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
we need to really pay attention to and
 
01:46:31.129 --> 01:46:31.139 align:start position:0%
that is the law and the climate in so
 
01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
many ways is different today than it was
 
01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
in 1980 or 1986 the last time that the
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
state made decisions on this subject
 
01:46:41.090 --> 01:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
implementing and repealing
 
01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:41.709 align:start position:0%
implementing and repealing
um

01:46:41.709 --> 01:46:41.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:41.719 --> 01:46:43.669 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:47.050 --> 01:46:47.060 align:start position:0%
the Advent of the BET and the credit the
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
single sales the market-based sourcing
 
01:46:54.850 --> 01:46:54.860 align:start position:0%
uh the taxing of guilty the the federal
 
01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
scheme for for all of this international
 
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
relations and in proposals that uh you
 
01:47:03.530 --> 01:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
know are still being discussed I think
 
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
another thing that we should take
 
01:47:10.010 --> 01:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
stock of is the fact that if the
 
01:47:13.010 --> 01:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
assumption is that businesses are
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
incentivized to move profits away from a
 
01:47:17.570 --> 01:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
higher tax country then it makes a
 
01:47:20.570 --> 01:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
difference what is evolving on the tax
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
rate side and so in 2017 uh the tax cuts
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
and jobs act reduced the maximum
 
01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:30.590 align:start position:0%
and jobs act reduced the maximum
corporate

01:47:30.590 --> 01:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
corporate
 
01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:31.310 align:start position:0%
corporate
um

01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:34.850 --> 01:47:34.860 align:start position:0%
tax rate from 35 to 21. that's a big
 
01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:35.750 align:start position:0%
tax rate from 35 to 21. that's a big
deal

01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
deal
 
01:47:38.810 --> 01:47:38.820 align:start position:0%
and at the same time the state of New
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire through a series of increments
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
has reduced our BPT from eight and a
 
01:47:45.649 --> 01:47:45.659 align:start position:0%
half to seven and a half percent we've
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
simultaneously been reducing the the
 
01:47:51.890 --> 01:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax rates so when
 
01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:52.609 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax rates so when
you

01:47:52.609 --> 01:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:47:56.330 --> 01:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
when you see tax rates coming down that
 
01:47:58.669 --> 01:47:58.679 align:start position:0%
mitigate the margin that theoretically
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
is being exploited you've got some
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
reason to think that the problem itself
 
01:48:07.729 --> 01:48:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
yes Mr pulley
 
01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
clarification like so
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
if you had your 76 countries and
 
01:48:15.850 --> 01:48:15.860 align:start position:0%
companies and were worried about
 
01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing abuse to a Cayman tub
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
or another low tax which is more
 
01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:22.139 align:start position:0%
infrequent now as you mentioned because
 
01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
of rate reduction in the U.S right
 
01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:25.490 align:start position:0%
of rate reduction in the U.S right
um

01:48:25.490 --> 01:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
if this is a U.S multinational those 76
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
companies again are
 
01:48:34.850 --> 01:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
put together in part of guilty which is
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
already in the New Hampshire tax base
 
01:48:40.609 --> 01:48:40.619 align:start position:0%
now there is a a hurdle level called 10
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
percent of qualified business asset
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
investment whatever it is Qi
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and then there's the 50 reduction and
 
01:48:50.330 --> 01:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
the apportionment that we've already
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
heard about so those are tweaks where if
 
01:48:54.169 --> 01:48:54.179 align:start position:0%
you're worried about the fairness of it
 
01:48:56.570 --> 01:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
it's already in the base in one form or
 
01:48:59.149 --> 01:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
another it's just taxation allows for
 
01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
these other things that may be deemed
 
01:49:04.250 --> 01:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
dilutive or not fair but they're in the
 
01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:05.090 align:start position:0%
dilutive or not fair but they're in the
base

01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
base
 
01:49:07.129 --> 01:49:07.139 align:start position:0%
right so I just wanted to highlight that
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
fact we've had a concept of transfer
 
01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
pricing creating base erosion right as
 
01:49:15.169 --> 01:49:15.179 align:start position:0%
compared to it's in the base it's just
 
01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
how they the state's chosen to tax it
 
01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
and I think the cost analysis was pretty
 
01:49:22.129 --> 01:49:22.139 align:start position:0%
interesting just to see New Hampshire's
 
01:49:24.530 --> 01:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
taxation of foreign income compared to
 
01:49:26.510 --> 01:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
other states where it's it's high right
 
01:49:28.129 --> 01:49:28.139 align:start position:0%
I mean just on
 
01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
on that analysis so I just want to
 
01:49:31.729 --> 01:49:31.739 align:start position:0%
highlight that where you were mentioning
 
01:49:34.609 --> 01:49:34.619 align:start position:0%
the 76 companies where it's in the base
 
01:49:36.109 --> 01:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
through that mechanism and that's the
 
01:49:38.570 --> 01:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
intention of it when you think of guilty
 
01:49:41.930 --> 01:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
is to try to uh kind of mitigate that
 
01:49:44.209 --> 01:49:44.219 align:start position:0%
kind of offshorem of profits federally
 
01:49:46.129 --> 01:49:46.139 align:start position:0%
they're you know there's different
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's tax credits as well that can
 
01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
soften that and all that but the state
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
right and I I
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you good points I think the fact
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
that the federal government deals with
 
01:50:01.199 --> 01:50:03.649 align:start position:0%
that the federal government deals with
taxation

01:50:03.649 --> 01:50:03.659 align:start position:0%
taxation
 
01:50:03.659 --> 01:50:04.669 align:start position:0%
taxation
um

01:50:04.669 --> 01:50:04.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
assessed and paid in other countries
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
through credits
 
01:50:11.649 --> 01:50:11.659 align:start position:0%
whereas the state of New Hampshire
 
01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
um the uncertainties where revenue is
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
derived through formulary apportionment
 
01:50:30.770 --> 01:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:33.590 --> 01:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative schamberger
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
are you hesitating I'm hesitating I just
 
01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.229 align:start position:0%
are you hesitating I'm hesitating I just
uh

01:50:39.229 --> 01:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
when you want the term transfer pricing
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
there's another part of that that should
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
be an arm's length approach that the
 
01:50:51.229 --> 01:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
federal government has stated and too
 
01:50:53.450 --> 01:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
much of that
 
01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:50:58.850 --> 01:50:58.860 align:start position:0%
separate it's it's not like
 
01:51:01.729 --> 01:51:01.739 align:start position:0%
the chair and I if we each had a company
 
01:51:04.370 --> 01:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
and were separate we could negotiate and
 
01:51:05.930 --> 01:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
say okay I'll charge you this and that
 
01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:07.010 align:start position:0%
say okay I'll charge you this and that
but

01:51:07.010 --> 01:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
a unitary company that
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
the chair has
 
01:51:15.649 --> 01:51:15.659 align:start position:0%
himself the senator you you
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
could you Mr Kennedy could say or Mr
 
01:51:21.530 --> 01:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
Foley could see
 
01:51:24.290 --> 01:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
uh even though representative Schamberg
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
would only charge you ten dollars we're
 
01:51:27.950 --> 01:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
going to charge you a hundred dollars
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
and you'll be able to take that
 
01:51:32.270 --> 01:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
and reduce your
 
01:51:34.729 --> 01:51:34.739 align:start position:0%
tax liability when you when you file
 
01:51:36.050 --> 01:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
your paperwork
 
01:51:39.290 --> 01:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
and I realized guilty but it's only on
 
01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:40.790 align:start position:0%
and I realized guilty but it's only on
U.S

01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
U.S
 
01:51:42.410 --> 01:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
based National
 
01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:52.250 --> 01:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
part of this we're not making we're not
 
01:51:54.910 --> 01:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
including the foreign Nationals
 
01:51:56.990 --> 01:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
multinationals in this
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:03.050 --> 01:52:03.060 align:start position:0%
back to that tournament we were making
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
that distinction before
 
01:52:06.770 --> 01:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:52:10.850 --> 01:52:10.860 align:start position:0%
we are including the us-based subsidiary
 
01:52:13.090 --> 01:52:13.100 align:start position:0%
and activity of the foreign
 
01:52:15.890 --> 01:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
multinational Enterprise
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
we're not including their
 
01:52:18.239 --> 01:52:20.270 align:start position:0%
we're not including their
non-nexus

01:52:20.270 --> 01:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
non-nexus
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
foreign activities
 
01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
and that's true for guilty too
 
01:52:26.689 --> 01:52:26.699 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's
 
01:52:28.729 --> 01:52:28.739 align:start position:0%
correct and so
 
01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
um and where it's interesting so I've
 
01:52:32.510 --> 01:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
worked with with many clients more on
 
01:52:33.649 --> 01:52:33.659 align:start position:0%
the smaller side
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
um purposely right that's the space I
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
want to play in but there's two classes
 
01:52:39.709 --> 01:52:39.719 align:start position:0%
I encounter a lot from a foreign side
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
just to highlight uh it one one is I
 
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
like the US market I'd like to start
 
01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
sales in New Hampshire seems nice I
 
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
vacationed there once when I was a kid
 
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
what have you it's strange how these
 
01:52:54.590 --> 01:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
decisions are made right this that the
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
other thing and I'm going to establish a
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
subsidiary there and start hiring there
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
so in the relative scheme of The Wider
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
business it's it's kind of small it's a
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
sales Venture right that's what they're
 
01:53:07.609 --> 01:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
doing the other common one that I
 
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
encounter and there's obviously large
 
01:53:10.970 --> 01:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
big big ones and we can talk about that
 
01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:11.990 align:start position:0%
big big ones and we can talk about that
but

01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
um is
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
um entities that are looking to raise
 
01:53:16.729 --> 01:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
Capital here in the states and so they
 
01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
actually do an anti-inversion right we
 
01:53:20.330 --> 01:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
think of inversions us going forward
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
they go foreign and become U.S parented
 
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
because that's how they can get
 
01:53:27.169 --> 01:53:27.179 align:start position:0%
investment here in the states
 
01:53:28.850 --> 01:53:28.860 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's funny as we've talked
 
01:53:30.410 --> 01:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
about all these things pushing things
 
01:53:31.970 --> 01:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
out I just want to highlight you know
 
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
those are the two experiences I'm seeing
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
so so for example this would be a way of
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
getting listed on the New York Stock
 
01:53:37.199 --> 01:53:38.169 align:start position:0%
getting listed on the New York Stock
exchanger

01:53:38.169 --> 01:53:38.179 align:start position:0%
exchanger
 
01:53:42.169 --> 01:53:42.179 align:start position:0%
stock exchanger or um become attractive
 
01:53:45.669 --> 01:53:45.679 align:start position:0%
to the PE or VC funds that are here
 
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
generally one of the conversations when
 
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
we get to these kind of accelerators and
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
whatnot is
 
01:53:53.450 --> 01:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
how are you going to become a domestic a
 
01:53:56.450 --> 01:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
U.S company Because unless you're a real
 
01:53:59.209 --> 01:53:59.219 align:start position:0%
rocket ship and a standout usually
 
01:54:01.129 --> 01:54:01.139 align:start position:0%
they'll pass on that investment
 
01:54:03.530 --> 01:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
without it being a us-based company so
 
01:54:06.410 --> 01:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of interesting just in
 
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
that regard
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
very interesting
 
01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:12.770 align:start position:0%
very interesting
um

01:54:12.770 --> 01:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
are we out of pause
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
I would just I think it's worth uh
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
taking note Meredith Beeson who was with
 
01:54:21.729 --> 01:54:21.739 align:start position:0%
us last Monday
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh has been tuning in and and heard our
 
01:54:28.570 --> 01:54:28.580 align:start position:0%
questions about the Minnesota and Maine
 
01:54:31.729 --> 01:54:31.739 align:start position:0%
and has done a little research which uh
 
01:54:33.410 --> 01:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
I'll take this as good information
 
01:54:36.050 --> 01:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
unless someone comes up with something
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
different you know I'll just read it to
 
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
you the Minnesota house tax committee
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
heard hf2883 a worldwide combined
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
reporting Bill and then it was inserted
 
01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
into an Omnibus tax bill HF 1938 this
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
included numerous other proposed tax
 
01:54:52.609 --> 01:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
policy changes and was passed by the
 
01:54:55.129 --> 01:54:55.139 align:start position:0%
house the issue was never introduced or
 
01:54:57.649 --> 01:54:57.659 align:start position:0%
even discussed in Senate committees as a
 
01:54:59.870 --> 01:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
standalone Bill like it was on the house
 
01:55:02.030 --> 01:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
side the mandatory worldwide combined
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
reporting provision with nhf 1938 was
 
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
then removed during negotiations by
 
01:55:08.810 --> 01:55:08.820 align:start position:0%
House and Senate tax committee members
 
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
before the final passage of this Omnibus
 
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
tax bill well we not we all know how
 
01:55:15.770 --> 01:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
those Dynamics work
 
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:17.820 align:start position:0%
uh in Maine
 
01:55:21.050 --> 01:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
LD 428 commissioned main Revenue
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
Services should do a fur a study to
 
01:55:25.010 --> 01:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
further look at worldwide and the state
 
01:55:27.410 --> 01:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
released their report in February there
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
has been no further discussion on the
 
01:55:30.169 --> 01:55:30.179 align:start position:0%
issue this year
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
so we might want to I don't think I've
 
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
seen it yet we might want to get a hold
 
01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
so I you know I I think
 
01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:51.950 align:start position:0%
so I you know I I think
um

01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
I think that the presenters paired us to
 
01:55:58.629 --> 01:55:58.639 align:start position:0%
see both sides of the question
 
01:56:01.370 --> 01:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
and uh in the colloquy here between
 
01:56:04.149 --> 01:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg and myself
 
01:56:06.649 --> 01:56:06.659 align:start position:0%
and all the comments I think we've
 
01:56:08.810 --> 01:56:08.820 align:start position:0%
pretty much put the issue up on the
 
01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:09.709 align:start position:0%
pretty much put the issue up on the
table

01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:56:13.010 --> 01:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
I think we we may need to tease things
 
01:56:15.410 --> 01:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
out for a uh
 
01:56:17.209 --> 01:56:17.219 align:start position:0%
um you know for a report for for
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
adequately explaining
 
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
inclusions but
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
we pretty much know now what I think
 
01:56:27.229 --> 01:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to know in the time frame
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
that we file this report
 
01:56:32.330 --> 01:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is at least
 
01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:34.490 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is at least
tentatively

01:56:34.490 --> 01:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
tentatively
 
01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:35.510 align:start position:0%
tentatively
um

01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:37.970 --> 01:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
is this a good time for us to each give
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
an indication for where we think we
 
01:56:42.530 --> 01:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
should go so we can see how it is that
 
01:56:46.189 --> 01:56:46.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to draft this report
 
01:56:49.729 --> 01:56:49.739 align:start position:0%
um yes Senator Murphy I wonder oh I'm
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
sorry okay sure
 
01:56:55.609 --> 01:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
um before we get to that I wonder if we
 
01:56:58.430 --> 01:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
might just hit the bullets relative to
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
some uh items that are generally
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
accepted as as you know base and I don't
 
01:57:05.570 --> 01:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
mean take a long time and then some of
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
those things for and against so that
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
because I think there are some things
 
01:57:10.850 --> 01:57:10.860 align:start position:0%
that we haven't discussed today that
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
were mentioned before
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
um but perhaps they were but I remember
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
um there was a reference to re
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
retaliation of other countries and we've
 
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
sort of touched base on that and New
 
01:57:22.910 --> 01:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire being an outlier that we've
 
01:57:24.890 --> 01:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
also touched base on that but I was kind
 
01:57:26.930 --> 01:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
of looking to just summarize the bullets
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I sure why don't you
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
take a stab at that all right um so
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
relative to what I I think we've all
 
01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
decided as as understood is that moving
 
01:57:39.169 --> 01:57:39.179 align:start position:0%
to worldwide reporting is not a
 
01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue that the Supreme
 
01:57:42.290 --> 01:57:42.300 align:start position:0%
Court has determined that would be
 
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
allowed that transfer pricing exists
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
um and likely or probably means that
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
revenue is being siphoned away from the
 
01:57:55.609 --> 01:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
state because of transfer pricing
 
01:57:55.619 --> 01:57:58.070 align:start position:0%
state because of transfer pricing
um

01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:02.330 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:58:02.330 --> 01:58:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:04.490 --> 01:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
and that New Hampshire uh doesn't
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
currently tax guilty which is somewhat
 
01:58:11.149 --> 01:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
unique and probably likely includes some
 
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
ability to tax
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
does tax guilty does tax guilty so those
 
01:58:19.149 --> 01:58:19.159 align:start position:0%
things we all kind of under understand
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
relative to the arguments against
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
um there's an indication that this would
 
01:58:27.229 --> 01:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
make New Hampshire an outlier relative
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
to the tech moving to worldwide
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
reporting we have concern of retaliation
 
01:58:33.169 --> 01:58:33.179 align:start position:0%
of other countries which may include
 
01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
losing local businesses
 
01:58:40.370 --> 01:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
um it would be more burdensome for both
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners for businesses and the New
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dra relative to compliance and
 
01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:48.109 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dra relative to compliance and
audit

01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
audit
 
01:58:48.119 --> 01:58:49.790 align:start position:0%
audit
um

01:58:49.790 --> 01:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
and again the argument against is that
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire does already tax uh
 
01:58:58.370 --> 01:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
guilty and foreign income is already
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
included at some level rather to foreign
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
dividends or guilty income
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
um the four
 
01:59:10.490 --> 01:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
would be that largely that there appears
 
01:59:12.109 --> 01:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
to be because of the transfer pricing
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
that there is an inequity between
 
01:59:18.410 --> 01:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
domestic New Hampshire companies and
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
foreign companies
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
um that uh this would address the
 
01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:26.639 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing issue to make things
 
01:59:29.089 --> 01:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
more Equitable
 
01:59:29.099 --> 01:59:29.750 align:start position:0%
more Equitable
um

01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:34.129 --> 01:59:34.139 align:start position:0%
and in theory keep profit within New
 
01:59:36.530 --> 01:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on again on a theoretical
 
01:59:38.450 --> 01:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
basis and I'm sorry one and some some
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
general items of just data is it's
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
unknown what the revenue results would
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
be what the effect in terms of how this
 
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
also plays with guilty
 
01:59:52.450 --> 01:59:52.460 align:start position:0%
potentially there are alternatives
 
01:59:54.770 --> 01:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
instead of going to worldwide reporting
 
01:59:59.330 --> 01:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
to address the transfer pricing issue
 
02:00:02.270 --> 02:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
um and we don't know in terms of the
 
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
revenues results we don't know how the
 
02:00:06.189 --> 02:00:06.199 align:start position:0%
denominator would change
 
02:00:08.930 --> 02:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
relative to now having to a portion out
 
02:00:10.250 --> 02:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
so those are the bullets that I have and
 
02:00:13.850 --> 02:00:13.860 align:start position:0%
I'd be very interested if anybody else
 
02:00:15.770 --> 02:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
has any bullets beyond what I just
 
02:00:15.780 --> 02:00:19.209 align:start position:0%
has any bullets beyond what I just
identified

02:00:19.209 --> 02:00:19.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much I think that's
 
02:00:23.530 --> 02:00:23.540 align:start position:0%
helpful I'll just make a comment that uh
 
02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of where we land on our
 
02:00:28.490 --> 02:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
recommendation I want to make sure that
 
02:00:31.810 --> 02:00:31.820 align:start position:0%
our report is a full disclosure document
 
02:00:36.649 --> 02:00:36.659 align:start position:0%
and so you know acknowledging uh the
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
pros and the cons I think is part of our
 
02:00:43.129 --> 02:00:43.139 align:start position:0%
duty uh in reporting and uh you know so
 
02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
for example if we recommend against it
 
02:00:47.209 --> 02:00:47.219 align:start position:0%
we still need to give the reasons why
 
02:00:49.310 --> 02:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
its proponents uh thought it would be
 
02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:50.689 align:start position:0%
its proponents uh thought it would be
worthwhile

02:00:50.689 --> 02:00:50.699 align:start position:0%
worthwhile
 
02:00:52.970 --> 02:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ellery yeah to
 
02:00:55.609 --> 02:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
exactly that end and and thank you for
 
02:00:58.609 --> 02:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
coming up with those points at
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty good start it
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
matter of fact is an excellent start
 
02:01:05.089 --> 02:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
um however with your second Point uh
 
02:01:08.689 --> 02:01:08.699 align:start position:0%
regarding uh transfer pricing exists but
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
we've also heard that we don't know that
 
02:01:15.229 --> 02:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
it exists we're presuming that it exists
 
02:01:17.930 --> 02:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
based upon corporate behaviors
 
02:01:19.609 --> 02:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
how do we
 
02:01:21.850 --> 02:01:21.860 align:start position:0%
get that
 
02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
nuanced in there
 
02:01:26.510 --> 02:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
so even if we stipulate there's an
 
02:01:30.890 --> 02:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:32.270 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's that affects two different issues
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
on that I I that that's that's a
 
02:01:40.729 --> 02:01:40.739 align:start position:0%
language issue and we're not just
 
02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:43.139 align:start position:0%
writing this for economists with all due
 
02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
regard but we're also writing it for the
 
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
common guy that sits in the house of 400
 
02:01:51.890 --> 02:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
people over there with a wide
 
02:01:54.169 --> 02:01:54.179 align:start position:0%
variety of experience
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
uh so which leads to my second question
 
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
we need to define the term denominator
 
02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:02.089 align:start position:0%
we need to define the term denominator
wow

02:02:02.089 --> 02:02:02.099 align:start position:0%
wow
 
02:02:04.370 --> 02:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
you guys know what it is
 
02:02:07.970 --> 02:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
let's it has to be
 
02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
the language needs to be as to what it
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
is I I think that's that's correct I
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
would agree with that I would like to
 
02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:16.070 align:start position:0%
would agree with that I would like to
report

02:02:16.070 --> 02:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
to include a description of what it
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
actually means
 
02:02:24.890 --> 02:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
to combine all worldwide uh entities and
 
02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
what gets swept into the equation as a
 
02:02:29.410 --> 02:02:29.420 align:start position:0%
result of it
 
02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:30.950 align:start position:0%
result of it
and

02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:34.430 --> 02:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
how does that affect the
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
the resulting dilution in that same
 
02:02:40.609 --> 02:02:40.619 align:start position:0%
formula of the New Hampshire activity
 
02:02:43.729 --> 02:02:43.739 align:start position:0%
you know something that may be
 
02:02:46.490 --> 02:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
um for one out of 50 states right that's
 
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
two percent
 
02:02:51.410 --> 02:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
I was reading some program uh within the
 
02:02:53.330 --> 02:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
last two years where I saw that the New
 
02:02:55.970 --> 02:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire share based on you know
 
02:02:59.089 --> 02:02:59.099 align:start position:0%
population and so on of some federal
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
large s was 0.34 percent
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
so if if if a very large corporation
 
02:03:10.129 --> 02:03:10.139 align:start position:0%
doing business in all 50 states has for
 
02:03:12.729 --> 02:03:12.739 align:start position:0%
sake of discussion
 
02:03:15.410 --> 02:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
0.34 percent of their activity in the
 
02:03:17.149 --> 02:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and they also
 
02:03:19.330 --> 02:03:19.340 align:start position:0%
happen to be multinational
 
02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
what percentage of this Revenue were
 
02:03:25.970 --> 02:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
forcing them to report
 
02:03:28.490 --> 02:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
will actually be attributed to New
 
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean it it it I won't say
 
02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
negligible that it's a very small
 
02:03:32.639 --> 02:03:34.669 align:start position:0%
negligible that it's a very small
percent

02:03:34.669 --> 02:03:34.679 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:03:37.490 --> 02:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
um I I think one of the things I'd like
 
02:03:39.229 --> 02:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
to include you know when we're doing the
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
pros and cons is
 
02:03:44.689 --> 02:03:44.699 align:start position:0%
um mitigating factors specifically
 
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
taking note of those changes in federal
 
02:03:51.010 --> 02:03:51.020 align:start position:0%
and state law since the 1980s
 
02:03:53.330 --> 02:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
you know at least potentially have uh
 
02:03:58.609 --> 02:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
have mitigated the issue
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
so we've I don't need to re-list them
 
02:04:02.450 --> 02:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
but all those things having to do with
 
02:04:05.089 --> 02:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
the rate and uh and and what we're
 
02:04:16.490 --> 02:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
um I can put my list together and send
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
it off Absolutely I'll send it to
 
02:04:28.850 --> 02:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:35.089 --> 02:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
well yes I'll chime in
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't think it was clear
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
to me today until today
 
02:04:45.410 --> 02:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman the disadvantage I was at on
 
02:04:47.689 --> 02:04:47.699 align:start position:0%
this committee in terms of background
 
02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:49.679 align:start position:0%
and knowledge
 
02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
um I have read everything provided I've
 
02:04:55.609 --> 02:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
watched either in person or recorded
 
02:04:57.530 --> 02:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
every speaker
 
02:04:57.540 --> 02:04:59.629 align:start position:0%
every speaker
but

02:04:59.629 --> 02:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:05:04.550 --> 02:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
you wrote an amicus brief on this issue
 
02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
is clearly a matter of passion and
 
02:05:09.410 --> 02:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
commitment for the published author
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative Schaumburg
 
02:05:13.790 --> 02:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
Keen is the
 
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:20.750 --> 02:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
a gentleman who makes Mr Mr Foley makes
 
02:05:23.689 --> 02:05:23.699 align:start position:0%
his living as an accountant
 
02:05:23.699 --> 02:05:25.370 align:start position:0%
his living as an accountant
um

02:05:25.370 --> 02:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
and Mr Foley you were on this committee
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
last year as a as an accountant and
 
02:05:33.890 --> 02:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
Mr Kennedy was the Bia yes
 
02:05:35.450 --> 02:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
any case
 
02:05:37.910 --> 02:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
so I had the most amount of sort of
 
02:05:40.490 --> 02:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
catching up to do I think
 
02:05:43.010 --> 02:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
and perhaps it would be
 
02:05:45.649 --> 02:05:45.659 align:start position:0%
my only thing I can bring to the table
 
02:05:48.770 --> 02:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
is sort of a fresh face approach to it
 
02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:50.390 align:start position:0%
is sort of a fresh face approach to it
because

02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:05:52.609 --> 02:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
as familiar as you all are with this
 
02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
topic matter topic I was not and
 
02:05:59.089 --> 02:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
despite having served some terms on
 
02:06:00.530 --> 02:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
house Ways and Means and I'll Senate
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means and having a basic
 
02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
understanding of business Taxation and
 
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
state law regarding this
 
02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:08.450 align:start position:0%
state law regarding this
um

02:06:08.450 --> 02:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:11.629 --> 02:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
I knew very little about the concept of
 
02:06:14.089 --> 02:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
unitary worldwide taxation
 
02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
before I walked into the room the first
 
02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:17.510 align:start position:0%
before I walked into the room the first
time

02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
but you asked where we think we're
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
coming down and I can only speak to
 
02:06:23.470 --> 02:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
myself in that matter
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
I think the cost of compliance I've been
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
convinced the cost of compliance would
 
02:06:30.770 --> 02:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
be inordinarily huge
 
02:06:32.209 --> 02:06:32.219 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's any chance the
 
02:06:34.490 --> 02:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
cost of compliance
 
02:06:36.770 --> 02:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
is going to be offset by whatever
 
02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:38.330 align:start position:0%
is going to be offset by whatever
Revenue

02:06:38.330 --> 02:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
02:06:40.850 --> 02:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
we may or may not gain as a result of
 
02:06:42.410 --> 02:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
adopting this
 
02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:43.970 align:start position:0%
adopting this
um

02:06:43.970 --> 02:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:47.570 --> 02:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
I'm also hesitant to embrace
 
02:06:49.810 --> 02:06:49.820 align:start position:0%
increasing cost on these corporations
 
02:06:52.609 --> 02:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
because as we all know all costs we
 
02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
apply to corporations are passed on to
 
02:06:56.450 --> 02:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
Consumers at the end
 
02:06:58.430 --> 02:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
I think it'd be a potentially a
 
02:07:00.770 --> 02:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
disadvantage for New Hampshire
 
02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:02.330 align:start position:0%
disadvantage for New Hampshire
companies

02:07:02.330 --> 02:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
companies
 
02:07:04.129 --> 02:07:04.139 align:start position:0%
and discourage future activity by those
 
02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:10.850 --> 02:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
and I have to say you know we all come
 
02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
at this from our own philosophical and
 
02:07:16.970 --> 02:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
political backgrounds and viewpoints
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
I kept seeing Delaware and South Dakota
 
02:07:19.679 --> 02:07:21.109 align:start position:0%
I kept seeing Delaware and South Dakota
mentioned

02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
and I suspect that different people look
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
at those
 
02:07:26.270 --> 02:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
those States and think different things
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
my my reaction was why relating them
 
02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:31.010 align:start position:0%
have all the fun
 
02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:32.890 align:start position:0%
have all the fun
[Laughter]

02:07:32.890 --> 02:07:32.900 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:07:35.089 --> 02:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
maybe there's some lessons there for us
 
02:07:38.089 --> 02:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
but that's my Approach and I I also
 
02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
think just in conclusion that one of the
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
big advantages of our tax system is that
 
02:07:43.370 --> 02:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
it's simple in New Hampshire our
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
corporate taxes are simple and I say
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
that as somebody who actually files them
 
02:07:47.689 --> 02:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
every year
 
02:07:49.850 --> 02:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
it's like usually is a
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
single piece of paper double-sided for
 
02:07:52.910 --> 02:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
my companies
 
02:07:56.570 --> 02:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
and I would be hesitant to
 
02:07:56.580 --> 02:07:57.410 align:start position:0%
and I would be hesitant to
um

02:07:57.410 --> 02:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:59.330 --> 02:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
make that immensely more complicated I
 
02:08:00.830 --> 02:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
think it's the cost compliance right now
 
02:08:02.510 --> 02:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
is very low and it should stay that way
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
so you asked where I where we would
 
02:08:07.970 --> 02:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
stand I'm coming down against it myself
 
02:08:09.410 --> 02:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:12.770 --> 02:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you great comments and
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking the First Leap
 
02:08:25.669 --> 02:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
oh Senator Murphy uh
 
02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
sat near me several years while I was in
 
02:08:33.410 --> 02:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
the house and uh
 
02:08:35.930 --> 02:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
set here on Ways and Means at the same
 
02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:37.370 align:start position:0%
set here on Ways and Means at the same
time

02:08:37.370 --> 02:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:08:37.380 --> 02:08:38.209 align:start position:0%
time
um

02:08:38.209 --> 02:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:40.970 --> 02:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
he's expressed several points that I
 
02:08:40.980 --> 02:08:43.250 align:start position:0%
he's expressed several points that I
concur

02:08:43.250 --> 02:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
concur
 
02:08:45.649 --> 02:08:45.659 align:start position:0%
pretty strongly with this America
 
02:08:49.010 --> 02:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
particularly the fact this whenever you
 
02:08:51.530 --> 02:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
start attacking
 
02:08:55.250 --> 02:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
the ability of an Enterprise to
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
earn a living for itself and pay back
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
its investors
 
02:09:03.530 --> 02:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
and then also grow which then provides
 
02:09:07.310 --> 02:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
jobs is a tax on people
 
02:09:10.250 --> 02:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
because the only people that pay taxes
 
02:09:12.649 --> 02:09:12.659 align:start position:0%
are people not corporations that's
 
02:09:14.689 --> 02:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
something we need to
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes gets lost in the mix of
 
02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:18.649 align:start position:0%
sometimes gets lost in the mix of
numbers

02:09:18.649 --> 02:09:18.659 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:09:22.490 --> 02:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:27.290 --> 02:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
now I I'm looking at Keane Keane and I
 
02:09:29.209 --> 02:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
had a brief conversation before we began
 
02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
and of course it's the position of the
 
02:09:34.010 --> 02:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
dra to remain neutral so uh that puts
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
Keen in an interesting position as a
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
voting member and all that Keen explain
 
02:09:41.570 --> 02:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh how he intends to navigate that
 
02:09:44.750 --> 02:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
that is correct so uh the DIA remains
 
02:09:48.649 --> 02:09:48.659 align:start position:0%
neutral on this uh on this issue and the
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
dra will do its level best whether the
 
02:09:55.490 --> 02:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh finally if the the commission or the
 
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
legislation decides to
 
02:10:01.490 --> 02:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
go worldwide or maintain Warriors age we
 
02:10:04.490 --> 02:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
will continue to do our function
 
02:10:06.770 --> 02:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
um as the revenue administration of New
 
02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and with that said we are
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:15.229 --> 02:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
so if there were things that had to do
 
02:10:17.209 --> 02:10:17.219 align:start position:0%
with procedure and so on you might weigh
 
02:10:20.209 --> 02:10:20.219 align:start position:0%
in but as to the pro and con on the
 
02:10:21.709 --> 02:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
bottom line issue
 
02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:26.639 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's very much understood
 
02:10:29.930 --> 02:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:31.189 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:10:31.189 --> 02:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:10:33.890 --> 02:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
um I saw that light on so well oh gosh I
 
02:10:35.450 --> 02:10:35.460 align:start position:0%
should have turned that off a while ago
 
02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:38.450 align:start position:0%
should have turned that off a while ago
so

02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:10:43.189 --> 02:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
I I guess to to qualify I'm also
 
02:10:45.770 --> 02:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
somewhat neutral except to the extent
 
02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:47.270 align:start position:0%
somewhat neutral except to the extent
that

02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:49.490 --> 02:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
um to me there's just a too many
 
02:10:52.189 --> 02:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
variables and an unknown which is
 
02:10:52.199 --> 02:10:53.810 align:start position:0%
variables and an unknown which is
concerning

02:10:53.810 --> 02:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I think the things that come to mind
 
02:10:59.570 --> 02:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
though I certainly do appreciate wanting
 
02:11:02.570 --> 02:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
to make the playing field Equitable and
 
02:11:06.770 --> 02:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
even and I'm just not sure that from the
 
02:11:08.810 --> 02:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
information that's been provided that we
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
have enough information to know that
 
02:11:13.129 --> 02:11:13.139 align:start position:0%
moving to worldwide reporting would
 
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
actually do that given that New
 
02:11:18.050 --> 02:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does tax the guilty tax given
 
02:11:20.930 --> 02:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the denominator would
 
02:11:23.810 --> 02:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
look like relative to the numbers
 
02:11:26.089 --> 02:11:26.099 align:start position:0%
um and I believe there are too many
 
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
unknowns this in conjunction with
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
um I'm again I appreciate that we'd like
 
02:11:34.129 --> 02:11:34.139 align:start position:0%
the playing field to be Equitable but I
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
don't actually see the direct benefit to
 
02:11:39.890 --> 02:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses right now if there
 
02:11:43.129 --> 02:11:43.139 align:start position:0%
was something that we felt that okay
 
02:11:45.050 --> 02:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
well now that we have more revenues
 
02:11:47.209 --> 02:11:47.219 align:start position:0%
coming in so the rate is going to go
 
02:11:49.310 --> 02:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
down or something but with all of those
 
02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
things and lastly the idea that maybe
 
02:11:54.290 --> 02:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
there is an alternative to addressing
 
02:11:56.330 --> 02:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
the transfer pricing rules which we
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
haven't which is not a bill or anything
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
um that those factors kind of guide me
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
to say that the complexity of moving to
 
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
um it might produce a benefit but it's
 
02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
it's probably just not at this none is
 
02:12:19.550 --> 02:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
very good weighing of the factors
 
02:12:24.890 --> 02:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
Mr Foley
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
I I should have asked before to the
 
02:12:31.089 --> 02:12:31.099 align:start position:0%
society I assume I'm neutral here which
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
I think would be our stance you probably
 
02:12:33.719 --> 02:12:34.850 align:start position:0%
I think would be our stance you probably
know

02:12:34.850 --> 02:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:12:38.030 --> 02:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
um but it's certainly uh I think
 
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
everything said
 
02:12:42.109 --> 02:12:42.119 align:start position:0%
preceding me kind of covers the facts
 
02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:44.099 align:start position:0%
and it's certainly an interesting
 
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
quandary that's been wrestled since the
 
02:12:49.609 --> 02:12:49.619 align:start position:0%
80s right in the enhancements in 482
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
which is the transfer pricing code and
 
02:12:54.530 --> 02:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
the cross-border litigation and having
 
02:12:56.629 --> 02:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
worked on those projects which we
 
02:12:59.589 --> 02:12:59.599 align:start position:0%
luckily haven't gotten too far into
 
02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's certainly an interesting space in a
 
02:13:03.890 --> 02:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
space that's been scrutinized and will
 
02:13:06.649 --> 02:13:06.659 align:start position:0%
continue to be and I think this has been
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
an interesting part of that so okay
 
02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg I guess I'm
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:24.649 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:13:24.649 --> 02:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:13:29.569 --> 02:13:29.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:31.850 --> 02:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
I will probably be on the minority end
 
02:13:34.250 --> 02:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
of this okay
 
02:13:37.850 --> 02:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:41.390 --> 02:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:44.030 --> 02:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
on this commission you know
 
02:13:46.490 --> 02:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
probably require that uh
 
02:13:48.890 --> 02:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
require a moral responsibility and a
 
02:13:50.629 --> 02:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
political responsibility
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
we can't separate political we can't
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
separate them more even though
 
02:13:58.910 --> 02:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
02:14:02.050 --> 02:14:02.060 align:start position:0%
this was done for the benefit of the
 
02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:04.270 align:start position:0%
this was done for the benefit of the
foreign

02:14:04.270 --> 02:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
multinationals and
 
02:14:10.310 --> 02:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
by saying that I go to the only
 
02:14:13.430 --> 02:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
Authority that has stated it back in
 
02:14:15.410 --> 02:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
1999 and that was a New Hampshire
 
02:14:17.089 --> 02:14:17.099 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
02:14:21.530 --> 02:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
stated that this bill this law Waters
 
02:14:25.609 --> 02:14:25.619 align:start position:0%
Edge was drafted it was presented for
 
02:14:30.430 --> 02:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
the benefit of foreign multinationals
 
02:14:34.430 --> 02:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
and no one has taken up that cause since
 
02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:35.990 align:start position:0%
and no one has taken up that cause since
1999.

02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
1999.
 
02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.569 align:start position:0%
1999.
uh

02:14:38.569 --> 02:14:38.579 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:40.850 --> 02:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
so I think what you're going to see
 
02:14:43.069 --> 02:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
though is that
 
02:14:44.870 --> 02:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
I will write
 
02:14:48.890 --> 02:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
a piece my report will be
 
02:14:52.129 --> 02:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
for the passage of this that'll be my
 
02:14:56.149 --> 02:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation because I believe that
 
02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
when you have a highest Authority in the
 
02:15:01.189 --> 02:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
land in the state of New Hampshire see
 
02:15:03.229 --> 02:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:15:05.629 --> 02:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
something that should be addressed and
 
02:15:07.790 --> 02:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
it was never addressed even from 1999
 
02:15:09.890 --> 02:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
onward I don't know
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
why someone hasn't addressed it but
 
02:15:15.890 --> 02:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
I am for it so
 
02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:17.350 align:start position:0%
I am for it so
okay

02:15:17.350 --> 02:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:15:20.930 --> 02:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
you stand in your ground
 
02:15:24.290 --> 02:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
um so I'll give you my views
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
um and much of what I believe has
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
already been said so I won't repeat
 
02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:30.950 align:start position:0%
already been said so I won't repeat
everything

02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:33.470 align:start position:0%
everything
but

02:15:33.470 --> 02:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't deny
 
02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
the potential for transfer pricing to be
 
02:15:42.050 --> 02:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
used for tax minimization in ways that
 
02:15:44.450 --> 02:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
cost New Hampshire money
 
02:15:46.669 --> 02:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
I would stipulate to that
 
02:15:49.550 --> 02:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
I would just simply use that Point of
 
02:15:52.149 --> 02:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
Departure to make the comment that it's
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
unmeasurable and inherently speculative
 
02:15:59.450 --> 02:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
and there are plenty of reasons to
 
02:16:02.689 --> 02:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
believe that it's not huge that it's
 
02:16:05.689 --> 02:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
nowhere near 177 million dollars
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
but again I'm speculating even when I
 
02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:15.050 --> 02:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
I think that the costs the policy costs
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
of having New Hampshire Venture into uh
 
02:16:22.430 --> 02:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
you know territory all of its own
 
02:16:25.069 --> 02:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
um in this case are potentially quite
 
02:16:28.729 --> 02:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
great uh I'm not an apologist for New
 
02:16:31.010 --> 02:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm perfectly happy that we do
 
02:16:32.929 --> 02:16:32.939 align:start position:0%
many things in our own way here
 
02:16:36.110 --> 02:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
including the BPT and bet
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm perfectly comfortable with the
 
02:16:39.770 --> 02:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
fact that we reached our own conclusions
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
on how to deal with guilty and uh and
 
02:16:46.429 --> 02:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
foreign dividend income but I believe
 
02:16:49.250 --> 02:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
that when you take stock of all of the
 
02:16:51.410 --> 02:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
legal changes both at the national level
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
and at the state level over the 40 years
 
02:16:58.610 --> 02:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
the discussions and the relative merits
 
02:17:02.089 --> 02:17:02.099 align:start position:0%
have shifted and we're not in the same
 
02:17:04.610 --> 02:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
evaluative equation that we would have
 
02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
been if this was 1987 or 88 and we were
 
02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
considering flipping back
 
02:17:13.730 --> 02:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
so I I think that the
 
02:17:17.870 --> 02:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
the fundamental challenges
 
02:17:22.750 --> 02:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
or the tax filers as well as for the
 
02:17:25.310 --> 02:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
administration for the dra
 
02:17:29.230 --> 02:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
are Monumental and I have a much easier
 
02:17:34.669 --> 02:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
ability to if not quantify to visualize
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
the cons the cons come across to me as
 
02:17:42.889 --> 02:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
more extensive and more compelling than
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
the pros the pros I wouldn't deny them
 
02:17:49.549 --> 02:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
but they're too theoretical to persuade
 
02:17:49.559 --> 02:17:50.889 align:start position:0%
but they're too theoretical to persuade
me

02:17:50.889 --> 02:17:50.899 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:17:52.849 --> 02:17:52.859 align:start position:0%
so I
 
02:17:56.030 --> 02:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
I would take the view that this
 
02:17:59.629 --> 02:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
commission make a recommendation to not
 
02:17:59.639 --> 02:18:00.770 align:start position:0%
commission make a recommendation to not
proceed

02:18:00.770 --> 02:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
02:18:03.709 --> 02:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
and and to specifically recommend two
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
house and to Senate ways and means that
 
02:18:08.810 --> 02:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
this is not a scheme that we should
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
Implement in New Hampshire
 
02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:11.690 align:start position:0%
Implement in New Hampshire
um

02:18:11.690 --> 02:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:14.270 --> 02:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
so having said that
 
02:18:18.169 --> 02:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
I think we have several members who are
 
02:18:20.810 --> 02:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
kind of in the neutral area
 
02:18:24.589 --> 02:18:24.599 align:start position:0%
and we have a proponent who wants to
 
02:18:26.509 --> 02:18:26.519 align:start position:0%
make that case
 
02:18:29.629 --> 02:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
and we have several of us who uh I think
 
02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
have come down on the con side and maybe
 
02:18:36.969 --> 02:18:36.979 align:start position:0%
it would be worthwhile
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
to have
 
02:18:41.870 --> 02:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
three drafts
 
02:18:43.629 --> 02:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
a a
 
02:18:47.230 --> 02:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
Advocates draft which I would ask
 
02:18:51.070 --> 02:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg to to do
 
02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:52.610 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg to to do
a

02:18:52.610 --> 02:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:18:55.310 --> 02:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
um opposing draft which unless somebody
 
02:18:57.650 --> 02:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
else would like to uh jump in I'm
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
I've been I've been anticipating that
 
02:19:06.049 --> 02:19:06.059 align:start position:0%
that Duty might fall on me yes I've got
 
02:19:06.059 --> 02:19:07.610 align:start position:0%
that Duty might fall on me yes I've got
notes

02:19:07.610 --> 02:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
notes
 
02:19:11.330 --> 02:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
um and then I think it may be that even
 
02:19:13.310 --> 02:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
the neutral
 
02:19:16.250 --> 02:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
um parties uh have something to say in
 
02:19:18.049 --> 02:19:18.059 align:start position:0%
terms of you know the pros and the cons
 
02:19:20.929 --> 02:19:20.939 align:start position:0%
and the complications
 
02:19:20.939 --> 02:19:21.770 align:start position:0%
and the complications
um

02:19:21.770 --> 02:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I think if we can
 
02:19:26.570 --> 02:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
suss out
 
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
perhaps something that Mr Kennedy and Mr
 
02:19:31.009 --> 02:19:31.019 align:start position:0%
Foley work on together
 
02:19:33.290 --> 02:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
something that representative shamberg
 
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
prepares something that I prepare
 
02:19:40.429 --> 02:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
um and circulate those prior to the 17th
 
02:19:42.889 --> 02:19:42.899 align:start position:0%
we may be in a position on the 17th to
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
you know draw our conclusions and even
 
02:19:48.290 --> 02:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
if they're editing that follows how does
 
02:19:52.610 --> 02:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:55.130 --> 02:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
so will you two gentlemen take that
 
02:19:55.140 --> 02:19:56.630 align:start position:0%
so will you two gentlemen take that
assignment

02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
assignment
 
02:19:56.640 --> 02:19:59.650 align:start position:0%
assignment
yeah

02:19:59.650 --> 02:19:59.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what's what's coming to mind
 
02:20:04.910 --> 02:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
is you you had mentioned that the
 
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
reports would weigh both the pros and
 
02:20:10.190 --> 02:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
cons yes so I'm thinking more that
 
02:20:13.490 --> 02:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
whatever we compile would maybe be
 
02:20:17.330 --> 02:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
incorporated into uh your report as you
 
02:20:20.270 --> 02:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
know I'm opposed but we recognize there
 
02:20:22.370 --> 02:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
are pros and cons on both sides so I'm
 
02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
not sure we would need a third report to
 
02:20:27.469 --> 02:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
actually again yes I think I think
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:30.899 align:start position:0%
very much as I think it would probably
 
02:20:34.730 --> 02:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
uh unfold you know let's let me just say
 
02:20:37.849 --> 02:20:37.859 align:start position:0%
that uh a personal perspective I hope I
 
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
when a legislative body decides that
 
02:20:45.410 --> 02:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
it's not appropriate to go forward with
 
02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't always mean that
 
02:20:50.389 --> 02:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
it's a terrible idea or that it's not at
 
02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
least conceptually well founded it just
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
means that on the way to the pros and
 
02:20:56.570 --> 02:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
the cons there's not a compelling enough
 
02:20:59.809 --> 02:20:59.819 align:start position:0%
reason to proceed with it right and so
 
02:21:03.050 --> 02:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
even a whole bunch of neutral commentary
 
02:21:05.809 --> 02:21:05.819 align:start position:0%
essentially represents a lack of
 
02:21:09.170 --> 02:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
conviction to go forward and we can see
 
02:21:09.180 --> 02:21:10.130 align:start position:0%
conviction to go forward and we can see
how

02:21:10.130 --> 02:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:21:13.250 --> 02:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
what we've written melds together and
 
02:21:14.690 --> 02:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
and I think you can certainly help
 
02:21:17.690 --> 02:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
bolster whatever I draft in terms of
 
02:21:19.370 --> 02:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
making sure that
 
02:21:22.250 --> 02:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
the report recognizes all the relevant
 
02:21:27.889 --> 02:21:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative Valerie
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
when you talk about three reports I I
 
02:21:36.889 --> 02:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily see that as three
 
02:21:40.849 --> 02:21:40.859 align:start position:0%
reports as much as three sections within
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
a report agreed and so there wouldn't be
 
02:21:46.130 --> 02:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
a Minority Report as such but there
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
would be a contrarian opinion view which
 
02:21:52.969 --> 02:21:52.979 align:start position:0%
Tom is very good at being a contrarian
 
02:21:52.979 --> 02:21:56.230 align:start position:0%
Tom is very good at being a contrarian
yeah

02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:59.870 --> 02:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
at the same time the non-partial view
 
02:22:02.330 --> 02:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
would probably be the Corpus of the the
 
02:22:07.010 --> 02:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
report and the final conclusion would be
 
02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:07.910 align:start position:0%
report and the final conclusion would be
um

02:22:07.910 --> 02:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of stuff you make up
 
02:22:11.809 --> 02:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
your own mind
 
02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
02:22:17.090 --> 02:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
in one way or another I'm reading that
 
02:22:19.370 --> 02:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
correct Mr chair
 
02:22:21.250 --> 02:22:21.260 align:start position:0%
yes I think very much
 
02:22:23.690 --> 02:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
once we see the drafts we'll know how
 
02:22:25.730 --> 02:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
well they fit but yes I I agree with you
 
02:22:28.010 --> 02:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
and I think it's the commission's report
 
02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:39.469 --> 02:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
okay well we did
 
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
um I should have mentioned this at the
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
beginning we did make the decision to
 
02:22:46.010 --> 02:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
live stream we know we have uh um people
 
02:22:50.330 --> 02:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
who have tuned in and uh we are creating
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
a record on a very very uh complicated
 
02:22:55.250 --> 02:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
subject matter that hasn't been
 
02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
Revisited this seriously in decades
 
02:23:00.770 --> 02:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
so it's also good that we have a
 
02:23:03.290 --> 02:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
recorded uh you know view of this I I
 
02:23:04.849 --> 02:23:04.859 align:start position:0%
know I'm going to go back and tune into
 
02:23:07.070 --> 02:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
the summaries here and make sure that I
 
02:23:12.130 --> 02:23:12.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
so thank you and unless there's anything
 
02:23:17.150 --> 02:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
anybody else wants to add I think it's
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
been a terrifically productive meeting I
 
02:23:21.650 --> 02:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
look forward to getting back together in
 
02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:27.730 --> 02:23:27.740 align:start position:0%
time is 12
 
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you oh thank you
 
02:23:42.309 --> 02:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
I've learned to watch
 
02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
probably more than any other commission
