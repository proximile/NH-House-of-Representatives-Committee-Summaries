DHHS Commissioners report associate

00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Patricia Tilly
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
I am an associate commissioner at the
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner Weaver sends her regrets
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
today um and we are a pretty small group
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
so I hope you don't mind I brought this
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
up here because I have some notes that I
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to put on paper um so I'll
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
start by saying this past month has been
 
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
a lesson in adaptive leadership
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
uh as we navigate a flood of information
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
coming to us from Washington while at
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
the same time we are deeply engaged in
 
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
the legislative process in this building
 
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
and in the building across the street
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
and the budgeting process so lots of
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
things to do and while there are a lot
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
of things we don't know about where
 
00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
things are going to land we are
 
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
incredibly grateful for um the focus of
 
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
our staff and Community Partners as they
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
continue to put their heads down and and
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
get the good work done so we are also
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
thankful um for the general court and
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
many of you and you sitting around this
 
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
table as we also navigate lots of this
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
uncertainty we've had lots of questions
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
um about Federal priorities and funding
 
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
and um right now we are all missing a
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
fascinating update from Henry Litman at
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
division 3 Finance as he talks about
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um and so he's going to be
 
00:16:26.749 --> 00:16:26.759 align:start position:0%
diving into some of those unknowns but
 
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
um today what we have in front of you
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
from DHHS we have some of the great work
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
from our staff from therapeutic cannabis
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
to Medicaid to work on Alzheimer's and
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
other dienas today for me I've got two
 
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
updates for you um and then always happy
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
to answer questions as as you get so
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
number one there was an electronic memo
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
sent to you I don't think we got paper
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
copies we fall apart when John Williams
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
isn't here but um you had an electronic
 
00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
copy about a YDC progress on the on the
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
new build um we have as you all know we
 
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
have passed that that in the fall we
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
passed the governor and Council um to
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
get to start the new build um currently
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
um we've had the hutter or HDR um cour
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh company out there doing work in
 
00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:17.799 align:start position:0%
Hampstead they uh to date some of the
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
things that have been done is the
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
installation of temporary fences there's
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
been tree clearing if you drive by and
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you do you can see that tree
 
00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
clearing we've begun the installation of
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
some of the storm water and pollution
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
prevention plan work we've done some
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
stump grinding any of you who' have done
 
00:17:36.909 --> 00:17:36.919 align:start position:0%
construction know that this is not
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
exactly the fun part of construction but
 
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
it is all the pre-work that needs to be
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
done from drainage to Foundation
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
excavation and doing some of the grading
 
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
for some of the perimeter work so you
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
know we continue to work towards a com
 
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
um a construction completion date of
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
June 30 2026 so a year and a half from
 
00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:00.039 align:start position:0%
now and we are are anticipating to be
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
operational by August 30
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
2026 um so after that we need some time
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
to um furnish and get everything going
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
but we're still about 18 months out or a
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
little bit less than that we also
 
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
continue to partner with the courts and
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
with others to make sure that we can
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
maintain the census that the new
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
building allows for as of today um we
 
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
have 12 youth at the snu center five
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
females seven males that FL that census
 
00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
as you all know by now fluctuates on a
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis it can go higher and
 
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
lower pretty quickly um and which is
 
00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:40.039 align:start position:0%
makes that important for that design to
 
00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:41.799 align:start position:0%
continue to be flexible to deal with
 
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
that of the mix of boys and girls you
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
know the number we know that where the
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
number cap needs to be but we do need a
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
little flexibility and as folks come in
 
00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
and out and the new design helps get us
 
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
there so that's my update on
 
00:18:57.789 --> 00:18:57.799 align:start position:0%
YDC um I'll go on the second update was
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
a request from representative McDonald
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit about ALS and the
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
ALS registry as many of you know HB 576
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
sought to amend our statutes and I know
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
that Dr Woods or representative Woods
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
was interested this around how do we
 
00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:18.039 align:start position:0%
think about developing a registry for
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
ALS an incredibly devastating disease
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
and something that we know that the
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
scientific and medical community and the
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
Public Health Community certainly wants
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
more information about um during that
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
hearing I didn't participate in those
 
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
hearings but you know it is my
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
understanding the department came in
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
with a sizable fiscal note um because
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
building new capacity to have a hippoc
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
compliance system that can take in the
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
information has generally cost us shy of
 
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
a million dollars of in this case we
 
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
came in at around 750,000 give or take
 
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
some some funds to build that system and
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
we certainly you know as I just spoke
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
with Senator gray we are in some awesome
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
de times right now and so the idea of
 
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
spending that kind of money is difficult
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh even though it is very much needed
 
00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:09.799 align:start position:0%
from um a health perspective so we've
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
gone back to the drawing board
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
internally um as well to have some
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
initial conversations about what data
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
sets we already have that might be able
 
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
to help us get us closer to having a
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
better understanding of this condition
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
so that you know what would happen if we
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
did not you know we didn't build the
 
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
brand new system that's typ compant
 
00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
where we could get the information
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
directly from from medical facilities um
 
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
what would happen if we looked at our
 
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
health dispar I mean our Hospital
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
discharge data htd our Hospital
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
discharge data and the all payer claims
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
or chis data those are the two big data
 
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
sources that we have um but neither of
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
them are particularly perfect they're
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
not there's information we could get
 
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
there but you know um they come with
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
some unique challenges the hospital
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
discharge data collects data from the 26
 
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals and the four specialty
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals it doesn't collect data from
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
primary care or other medical um
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
facilities or you know Physicians
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
offices or or urgent care it's also
 
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
based on discharges which means that a
 
00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:18.039 align:start position:0%
patient can visit or be hospitalized
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
several time or you know with different
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals and sometimes you can't always
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
draw the connection around a diagnosis
 
00:21:27.149 --> 00:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
when you're there for the claims for
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
what the service is that that person
 
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
received um it also um for those reason
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
it really can't be um used as a registry
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
to identify like an incident rate that
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
is my understanding of what the ALS
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
registry wanted to get at so that we
 
00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:46.039 align:start position:0%
could sort of have a denominator like we
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
have a cancer where we know rates the
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
hospital discharge data could give us
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
information but it would probably be
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
incomplete similarly chiz is based on
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
claims um data um one diag nois often
 
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
has many multiple claims it's a good
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
resource to evaluate the cost for
 
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
procedures but not as good of a resource
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
to um figure out diagnoses or the number
 
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
of diagnoses or the rate of diagnoses um
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
and it also doesn't collect um self-pay
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
or direct pay so those that's where
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
we've started since this um the last
 
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
hearing to really sort of go okay what
 
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
do we have what are the pros and cons
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
what can they do and what can they not
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
do um and then I think we we're very
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
very happy to continue to work with the
 
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
committee of trying to think about other
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
ways that we can get to an end um that
 
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
may not be as pricey as what we we
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
believe a a full registry would cost so
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
um those are the my two updates for
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
today as always I'm happy to answer any
 
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.190 align:start position:0%
today as always I'm happy to answer any
questions

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
or any questions for the associate
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
commission Senator Rosenwald thank you I
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
questions about both of those things you
 
00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:00.039 align:start position:0%
talked about great um for I think four
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
years I was on the rare disease advisory
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
Council and almost every meeting we
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
would talk about whether it was a we
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
should try to get the state to set up an
 
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.990 align:start position:0%
should try to get the state to set up an
ALS

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
ALS
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
register there was not agreement on that
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
rare disease advisory
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
Council that that was a good idea or
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
good use of State resources so I guess
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
my question is how closely is the
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
department working with the rare disease
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
advisory Council I know there are these
 
00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:42.919 align:start position:0%
doctors at Dartmouth who are really into
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
it yep yeah I maybe Dartmouth will pay
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
for it yeah that's a great question so
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
we as many of you know who have been
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
around the ALS registry bill has come
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
back it's sort of a perennial favorite
 
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
to come we've been working closely of
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
course on the rare disease advisory
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
Council we have staff that are Staffing
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
that as well and I know that they've had
 
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
they've been on both sides of this issue
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
um you know I I am neutral in in you
 
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
know I'm happy to explore anything that
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
we that we asked to explore and also
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
describe what the cost would be to do
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
the do that work we've at we've worked
 
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
with Dartmouth Dartmouth um and that has
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
often been our recommendation is maybe
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth can do that especially because
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
they have access to all their own data
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
and even if they can't get a population
 
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
uh estimate they certainly will have a
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
better idea um as just the largest
 
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
provider in the state so I think those
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
are all reasonable questions to ask um
 
00:24:40.389 --> 00:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
for this committee we wanted to just do
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
our due diligence again to look at the
 
00:24:44.909 --> 00:24:44.919 align:start position:0%
data sets that we have and describe the
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
pros and cons of using them and and
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
describe what they could and could not
 
00:24:52.269 --> 00:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
do between Hospital discharge and shis
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay and if I I'd saw repres I'd seen
 
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
representative Woods next
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um um I'm new to the
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm not new to the ALS as
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
um um and I'm ask perhaps a very naive
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
question and have to understand that and
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
I'll accept that if I am uh but it seems
 
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
like uh when we saw that fiscal note
 
00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039 align:start position:0%
that uh just from the data perspective
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
that I mean um let's say the cancer
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
registry now they have a grant or
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
okay if uh the like something like the
 
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
cancer registry uh they have a system
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
set up and a very good database and and
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
functioning it seemed like you know uh
 
00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
maybe we could share this maybe uh
 
00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:45.799 align:start position:0%
you're having a database over here uh if
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
we get a little bit of a grant or so
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
forth or just a few more funds we can
 
00:25:54.389 --> 00:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
share all of that infrastructure instead
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
of starting like the fiscal note said on
 
00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:00.039 align:start position:0%
this year's bill of whatever $800,000
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
starting denovo MH uh I mean it seems
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
like this would be an absolutely perfect
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
place to share some of that and disperse
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
and U some of the costs I think I think
 
00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:16.039 align:start position:0%
that it's great for us to sort of dig in
 
00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
a little bit deeper on there are um
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
obvious constraints you know the cancer
 
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
registry is mostly paid for by federal
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
funds it is in alignment with national
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
standards you know there it is a thing
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
um again because it and it's been up and
 
00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
running you know in some form or another
 
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
for you know since the 1980s I believe
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head um I I think
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
there might you know we could explore
 
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
ways of like what would what would it
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
look like to do an extra module on top
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
of the existing structure I think it
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
would still be expensive at the end of
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
the day you know we've been doing
 
00:26:55.149 --> 00:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
Registries for a while and doing trying
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
to do our data
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
modernization and the cost of the fiscal
 
00:27:02.669 --> 00:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
note is about what it's been costing us
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
to do whether it's you know in any area
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
of Public Health to be able to get in
 
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
you know a hipa compliant system that we
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
can maintain that's on the same sort of
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
Salesforce platform as the rest of the
 
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
department the cancer registry as you
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
know is based out a you know it is a
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
department function we contract with the
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth we use you know a system that
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
is based on National standards so there
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
were a lot of moving pieces there to get
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
to you know it's not as easy like just
 
00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
adding an extra tab on an Excel sheet
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's there would be a lot of work to
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
get to that I think the rare disease
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
council is probably a place to start
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
having some of those conversations of
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
whether that would be a good use of of
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
resources representative
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
Weber I was just going to comment on
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
representative Rosen wald's question and
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
say that last year the discussions were
 
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
all centered around having it based at
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and the wheels I I was not
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
involved in the negotiations but the
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
wheels came off partway through I don't
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
know if representative McDonald
 
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
remembers more about it I know that um
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
um representative Murphy was um the lead
 
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919 align:start position:0%
on that and just couldn't make it happen
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
and I suspect if he couldn't make it
 
00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:24.919 align:start position:0%
happen it probably wasn't going to
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
happen so I know we worked very hard on
 
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.149 align:start position:0%
happen so I know we worked very hard on
it

00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you so on the
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
new the new Youth Center that's being
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
built in Hamstead I noticed um in
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
looking through the budget
 
00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
that there's big increases in both the
 
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
next two years in the operating
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
budget um which surprised me since this
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
census continues to be really low I mean
 
00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
we're spending over a million dollars
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
per kid per
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
year how much of that increase which is
 
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.029 align:start position:0%
year how much of that increase which is
like

00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
million is attributed to building a
 
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
bigger space in
 
00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.549 align:start position:0%
bigger space in
Hamstead

00:29:23.549 --> 00:29:23.559 align:start position:0%
Hamstead
 
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
than perhaps the legislature originally
 
00:29:27.399 --> 00:29:28.909 align:start position:0%
than perhaps the legislature originally
thought

00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
I what's going to happen or is it oper
 
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
staff cost it's all staff cost it's
 
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
really and I and what um if Nathan were
 
00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
here today if Nathan white were here
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
today he would um remind us that when we
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
were funding this current bium um lots
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
of conversations about YDC he would
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
suggest that it was underfunded in this
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
current banum and so we're trying to get
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
the next B anum's budget to be closer as
 
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
you saw we did a budget transfer today
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
that in part had money for for syc in it
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to get the budget closer
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
to what the cost for operations you know
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
for running a 247 facility you know the
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
the hamstad physical building is
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
actually going to be much smaller than
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
the as you know than the current
 
00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:13.519 align:start position:0%
facility here but we would we anticipate
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
the same number of kids we have 12 kids
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
today we're going to anticipate 12 kids
 
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
a day um when we go down to to Hampstead
 
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
but running getting Staffing for that
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
24/7 and especially when we have to rely
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
often for with tempor staff or you
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
contracted staff um it it's been
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
costly it's my recollection that some of
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
it was a modest addition to the
 
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
footprint and the reason was the
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
conclusion that came a little bit late
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
in the game that 12 people aren't just
 
00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:48.519 align:start position:0%
12 people right a group of them may be
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
in a gang that is the enemy to the other
 
00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:54.519 align:start position:0%
group and as a result the facility had
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
to be broadened somewhat yeah you're
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct representative again
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
a reminder that the cost of the building
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
of the facility is not General funds as
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
you know it's arpa funds so the the
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
general funds that you see in the budget
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
are really around operating costs rather
 
00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
than the building cost but you're
 
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely right which is why I
 
00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:15.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we need to have that
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility because again you have to
 
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
separate boys and girls you've got to
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
separate their Sight and Sound
 
00:31:24.269 --> 00:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
separations you've got to um move people
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
around and you know if you can think
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
back to the fall when there was a lot of
 
00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:30.519 align:start position:0%
conversation about that um I think we
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
were using um the term beds probably in
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
a in a way that wasn't always helpful
 
00:31:38.909 --> 00:31:38.919 align:start position:0%
that it's really not about um that we
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
may need more beds than we have youth at
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
any given time in fact I would say we
 
00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
always need more beds than we have youth
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
because you've got to move people around
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
you got to have a sick room you've got
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
to do that and you've got to have that
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility I think that caused a lot of
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
um miscommunication or consternation
 
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
earlier in the fall as we walk through
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
that would you believe that once your
 
00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
building started in Earnest it's not
 
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
stopped snowing in my front yard 300
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
yards to the south of this facility and
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
I will give you 6 weeks for this to stop
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
we'll work on that sir thank you when
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
yes Senator so is it are you guys
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
budgeting for 12 kids we are budgeting
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
for um a anticipated anti anticipated 12
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
kids there is flexibility to 18 which I
 
00:32:27.149 --> 00:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
know is controversial but we are looking
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
for we're budgeting for the amount that
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
we are supposed to budget for
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
12 Senator gray on a different subject
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you can is is your question on
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
this subject no okay Senator gray
 
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
okay a year ago I was concerned that we
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
weren't having someone look at the
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
department for compliance with both
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
state and federal requirements they told
 
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
me that there was an audit division in
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
your group that does all of that I would
 
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
like a report from them that tells me
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
what they've audited kind of you know
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
true a general nature and how many they
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
found to make sure that it is something
 
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
that is functioning and you know we get
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
a fuzzy feeling that you know all of
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
those laws that uh we seem to want to
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
pass are are being upheld so if I could
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
get that you know at the next meeting I
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
don't know that we can do that in time
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
for the next meeting but I'd love to
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
have you and our audit team to sort of
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more of what that
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
would look like of what you would like
 
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
to see in a report um but we have a
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
robust dpq program that does some
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
internal auditing and also manages all
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
of the federal audits that we receive as
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
well certainly working on the chair work
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
working with the chair uh you can get it
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
on the the agenda for whichever meeting
 
00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
is appropriate great thank you John
 
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:53.310 align:start position:0%
Williams this is for you wherever you
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:54.750 align:start position:0%
Williams this is for you wherever you
[Laughter]

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
want thank you
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
represented representative
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
getting back to O OLS ALS got to get my
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
my abbreviations correct sorry we've all
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
got on
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
the and getting back to ALS
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
um it's um you had mentioned it's a very
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
complex disease uh and the expense of
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
getting tracking any new uh illness
 
00:34:29.069 --> 00:34:29.079 align:start position:0%
because because of the hipper
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
regulations and so forth is ALS in
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
particular very complex uh or is it just
 
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
because we we don't have the system in
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
place right now I think it's both I well
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
I would primarily say we don't have a
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
system in place we could you know um
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
cancer is also complex and that's why we
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
have a very um robust cancer registry
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
that you know looks at everything from
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
incidence rates and diagnosis to tumors
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
and staging so we have the you know
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
technical experience
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
um and certainly to work with you know
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
Partners or or vendors to help us build
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
something like that but it comes at a
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
cost to be able to do that and similarly
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
ALS um in terms of when it gets
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
diagnosed and when I go to those and I
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
know it's sort of a deep dive into wonky
 
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
data but like the the hospital discharge
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
data and that claims data you know picks
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
up the claim so it might not have a
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
diagnosis attached to it that's what
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
makes it complicated so you go in for a
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
feeding tube adjustment you know in the
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
late stages you might not necessarily
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
know by looking at that that database
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
that that person had ALS okay I follow
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
up follow up
 
00:35:45.069 --> 00:35:45.079 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding there's only
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
our best information that came out of um
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
the testimony was there's like 66
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
diagnosed cases currently in New
 
00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that that is my
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
understanding that it's relatively small
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the number off the top of
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
my head but yes it's it's you know to
 
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
the point of you know it makes sense to
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
talk about it at the rare disease um
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
advisory it is not as rare as some of
 
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
rare diseases that they discuss there
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
it's certainly known but it has a
 
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
relatively small number okay and final
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
followup yes follow up um so it's so
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
it's a complex disease but no more
 
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
complex than say cancer or others y so
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
you anyone else for the associate
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner representative Woods uh
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
more of a comment um is a complex
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
disease uh not in the same sense of
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
cancer cancer has basically a particular
 
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
cell type which is easily
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
identified and identifiable ALS is
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
multi-stem disease and therefore it's
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
much more complex because of the
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
multiple system interactions and that's
 
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:52.599 align:start position:0%
where the difficulty comes in so it's a
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit different just for
 
00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
seeing nothing thank you so much thank
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
Williams chair recognizes Jenny
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
committee on Alzheimer's disease and
 
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
related dementia and you have an
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
wonderful what this is all one copy this
 
00:37:26.589 --> 00:37:26.599 align:start position:0%
one copy yes yes it's it's got all of

is Jenny Horan I'm the senior public
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
policy manager for the Alzheimer's
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
Association here in New Hampshire very
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
grateful to be here in front of you all
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
today very grateful to the chairman as
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
well for giving us a little bit more
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
time for me to get my feet under me
 
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
before I'm I'm really sorry but I
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
normally draft on a computer and I
 
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
listen in L hand but trying to
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
transcribe those notes was horrible so
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to take notes on a computer
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm new at it and if you could speak
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
just a hair slower Absolut really
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate it absolutely I do talk so
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll I'll make sure to slow down
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
but remind me if I pick up speed again
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate the combination we want
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
to thank the chairman for giving us a
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
little more time before I gave this
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
presentation so very grateful for that
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
um I also want to say thank you to
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
Senator avard he has been a really
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
thoughtful leader on the subcommittee
 
00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
for us as chairperson so we're very
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
grateful for his time and energy as
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
chair I know you all have the report in
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
front of you we've spent the past year
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
or so under Senator aar's leadership of
 
00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
gathering information regarding
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's in the state of New
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire regarding the types of
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
dementia care that exists instances of
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
abuse and exploitation that are managed
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
under the Department of Justice some of
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
the strains that caregivers are
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
experiencing across the state services
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
and programs that are available either
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
through the department or through adult
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
St centers um home and health hospice as
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
well as choices for Independence so this
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
past year has really been an instance of
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
gathering information for us to really
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
understand the landscape of the state of
 
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
dementia and Alzheimer's in New
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so as you can see from our
 
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
report lots of really good data and
 
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
information in there Our intention for
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
this next year um and Senator avart has
 
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
directed us at our next meeting to kind
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
of really identify the gaps that we see
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
in the state and the system and then
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to start pulling that
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
information together to start working on
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
a state plan which is um encompassing
 
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
our duties as a subcommittee so we've
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
continued to meet since we fi finalized
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
this report in November we had some
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
really good presentations from the
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
bureau on adult and Aging Services as
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
well as from the detective sergeants who
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
run the silver alerts program and the um
 
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan from fishing game so we
 
00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
are really excited to move into this
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
next phase of really craft
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
you know what is happening in the state
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of a state plan and what kind
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
of recommendations we'd like to make in
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
the coming year so I'm happy to answer
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
any questions did I hear you say that a
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
state plan is being worked on we we are
 
00:40:16.349 --> 00:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
in the very early stages so we're
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
identifying the gaps right now and then
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
I think in the next coming meetings
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
we'll start looking at what that state

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
two does anyone um on the committee have

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
question at this time I'm stalling for
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
the clerk here slowly
 
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
speaking so she can the more you talk
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
the more you don't say write everything
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
I say I don't pay attention to half of
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
it I I
 
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
just does anyone have a
 
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:43.720 align:start position:0%
question I don't write that down I do
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosen thank you I'm hoping to be
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
besides Glen Cliff forget about it which
 
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
does a great job old though it is um we
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
Jos pych units in this state do we have
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
enough geros psych impatient
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
capacity for meetings and need I would
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
say anodally and I can certainly get
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
back to you with more specifics anodally
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
we are all very aware that Alzheimer's
 
00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
is a growing and significant issue in
 
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire I believe
 
00:42:26.589 --> 00:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
that we I'm going to slow down my
 
00:42:29.549 --> 00:42:29.559 align:start position:0%
speaking I believe that we have 33 Jans
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
in the state based off of the last data
 
00:42:34.589 --> 00:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
sources we are all aware of the strains
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
on our long-term you know care
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
facilities um and Alzheimer's and
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
Dementia is only going to continue to
 
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
grow in terms of numbers across the
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so I think that
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's important to as part of our state
 
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
plan to really look at where those
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
numbers are going to end up and where
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
our capacity is in the state because it
 
00:42:56.549 --> 00:42:56.559 align:start position:0%
is going to continue to grow and there
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
capacity anyone else could I just get a
 
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
clarification on that one when you say I
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
mean we all understand that there's
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
small capacity are we at too little
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
capacity right now are we at
 
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
capacity um or do you have a sense of
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
that is that one of the things you're
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
still studying I think that that's
 
00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
something that we're still looking at in
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
terms of what that would mean in the in
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
part of the state plan develop you know
 
00:43:34.549 --> 00:43:34.559 align:start position:0%
taking those exact numbers and seeing
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
where capacity currently lies I know
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of change over the
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
past number of years regarding you know
 
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
facilities being open and a lot of
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
adjustment in that so I think our state
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
plan will definitely be able to give a
 
00:43:50.549 --> 00:43:50.559 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive understanding of
 
00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:52.559 align:start position:0%
where those numbers are at and what the
 
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
capacity looks like thank you now
 
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.230 align:start position:0%
capacity looks like thank you now

Program um the centers for Medicare and
 
00:45:46.549 --> 00:45:46.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services had offered the option
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
to States in 2023 to extend Medicaid
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility for uh women who are in the
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
postpartum period to a 12-month uh
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
length of time
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
previously we had covered them for 60
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
days and uh the general court enacted
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
legislation in hp2 in the 2024 2025
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
budget uh directing us to submit a state
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
plan amendment to enact this extended
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
postpartum coverage period and that
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
state plan amendment was approved uh
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
November 3rd of
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
2023 as of January this year there are
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
45 48 states who have implemented this
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
along with New Hampshire and the map on
 
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:31.640 align:start position:0%
this slide just depicts that you know
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
the states that have adopted the 12
 
00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.790 align:start position:0%
the states that have adopted the 12
month

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
extension so uh because of where we are
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
in the timeline of this policy change
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
and then with claims data you know often
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
there's a 90-day lag for we for us to
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
have a complete claims history we're
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
only looking initially at women who
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
delivered in August through October of
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
2023 and then the 12 months you know
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
following that and then you know seeing
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
complete claims for about September of
 
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
last year so this is emerging data on a
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
small cohort and we expect to have more
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
information you know in future updates
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
looking at that small
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
cohort uh we uh examined the claims of
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
services delivered for these women 95%
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
of them did receive Medical Services in
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
that extended period
 
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
52.4% receive mental health or substance
 
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
use disorder treatment services
 
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
26.7% received preventative health
 
00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
visits and 3.2% received a heart or
 
00:47:34.599 --> 00:47:36.710 align:start position:0%
visits and 3.2% received a heart or
hypertention

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
hypertention
 
00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
service so I would welcome any questions
 
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh to help direct you know what what
 
00:47:43.549 --> 00:47:43.559 align:start position:0%
topics may be of interest for future
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
reporting and again expect to have more
 
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
data as we have a longer run out from
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
this policy change I get the purple was
 
00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
conson thing it means they have
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
unlimited it's not 12 months it's keep
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
going but it says hover over the state
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
and I've been hovering over Arkansas and
 
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
all I get is a hole so tell me what
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
Arkansas is doing in there Arkansas did
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
not adopt the option to extend
 
00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.589 align:start position:0%
not adopt the option to extend
coverage

00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
I'm calling Sarah any other questions
 
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you so as I
 
00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
recall the income limit for pregnant
 
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
women is
 
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
250% um it's
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
2011% Federal poty Li okay so but it's
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
above the income limit for Medicaid
 
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
expansion so which is 138 so I I mean I
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
guess my question
 
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
is are we making sure that people who
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
are eligible for Medicaid
 
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.069 align:start position:0%
are eligible for Medicaid
expansion

00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
are made it or in that bucket since we
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
get a way higher Federal mat than just
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
saying oh you had a baby we can cover
 
00:49:04.589 --> 00:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
you yes for 12 months at
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
50% yeah it's an excellent point that 65
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
whatever it is yes thank you for the
 
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
question it's an excellent point that
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's relative match you know in
 
00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
different eligibility groups and when we
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
complete our federal claiming uh which
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
happens quarterly uh we do ensure we we
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
take the highest possible match u based
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
on eligibility group thank
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
you representative Woods thank you Mr
 
00:49:34.349 --> 00:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
chair um in the medical community we're
 
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
very much aware of the ROI on this kind
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
of a program uh and judging from the
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
fact that I see uh and I wasn't aware
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
that pretty much we have 100% coverage
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
um have you H since this implementation
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
have you had a chance or any data about
 
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
the ROI on this
 
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
program so I think that's something
 
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
we'll be in a better position to examine
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
with a longer time Horizon out since
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
we're just now you know capturing the
 
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
first two months of deliveries that have
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
a whole year um but I think it's a great
 
00:50:11.789 --> 00:50:11.799 align:start position:0%
a great point that ultimately we want to
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
make sure um we're seeing value um for
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
for expanding the the coverage
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
period um so that's in place I mean that
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the ROI is looking is that in
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
place it's in place in the sense that we
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
we will return to this claims data you
 
00:50:32.109 --> 00:50:32.119 align:start position:0%
know which is always available to us and
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
be able to do analyses to look at I mean
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm interested in what your your
 
00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
view on Roi is I mean one thing we could
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
look at is you know avoided um hospital
 
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
visits or Ed
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
utilization um preventing higher cost
 
00:50:50.109 --> 00:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
Services by being able to deliver you
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
know more preventive care by virtue of
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
having this this coverage it's never
 
00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
super simple you know to find Roi in a
 
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program but I think um the
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
spirit of that analysis is certainly
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
ending you have other states to compare
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
right that's a good point when I helped
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
in the house with Medicaid dental there
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
were numbers of people who wanted it
 
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
because they saw this from a
 
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
compassionate perspective how I was able
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
to win over some others was very simple
 
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
spend a little bit now or spend a lot
 
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
more then I hated to have to argue on
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
that basis but I wanted their votes more
 
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
and actually some people bought it
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
however some people came back to me and
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
said it's all well and good to say there
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
is return on investment show me real
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
numbers so I would suggest that after a
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
year or so you come back with that and
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
the reason is not that I don't believe
 
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
it I do believe it but there are people
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
who don't and I want to be armed with
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
that absolutely thank you and
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and just as a
 
00:51:57.549 --> 00:51:57.559 align:start position:0%
corollary to that that might also be
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
helpful when the next program comes
 
00:52:05.309 --> 00:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
along when we say gee dental cost a lot
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
more the first year while we were fixing
 
00:52:10.109 --> 00:52:10.119 align:start position:0%
people who hadn't had care but look at
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
what's happened on year 2 3 4 five and
 
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
six and similarly with your program if
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
we can show that there are similar good
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
outcomes it might actually give people
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
an impetus to say oh yeah they're right
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
they're not just talking out of the top
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
of their heads thinking that this is
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
happening we've documented
 
00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
it if you could pass that one along to
 
00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
ra Mr Litman absolutely and let him know
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
because he regularly shows up here and
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh we've had Medicaid dental for a bit
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
now that would be very helpful and thank
 
00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
you bring that up anyone else for Miss
 
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.870 align:start position:0%
you bring that up anyone else for Miss
May

00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
May
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
and we bring back Michael Holt
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
administrator dph Department of Public
 
00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
Health of the DHHS therapeutic cannabis
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
report uh thank you very much for the
 
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
record my name is Michael Holt I'm the
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
administrator of the therapeutic
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis program with the Department of
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I'm here today
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
to present and answer questions about
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
the annual therapeutic cannabis program
 
00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
uh data report uh you should have all
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
have that in front of you um the report
 
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
is required by Statute RSA 126 X10 um
 
00:53:49.789 --> 00:53:49.799 align:start position:0%
the report includes data on patients
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
caregivers and certifying providers who
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
are active in the program as of June
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
30th 2024 so we uh do this report based
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
on uh State fiscal year um the report
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
also includes um summary data from the
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers um based
 
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
on their annual reports to the
 
00:54:11.069 --> 00:54:11.079 align:start position:0%
department um if you want to take a
 
00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
quick look at page three of the report
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
gives you a snapshot of patient growth
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
over the years um we have seen growth um
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
since the program was established in
 
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:25.240 align:start position:0%
2013 and then operationalized in 2016 uh
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
but that growth is slowing
 
00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
1475 patients uh registered with the
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
program um this is this is the lowest
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
number of patients uh nationally for a
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh State per capita for enrollment in a
 
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
in a medical program um that's data not
 
00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:49.799 align:start position:0%
in the report but information has come
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
from uh other uh the marijuana policy
 
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
project has done a study on that um so
 
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
it's about yeah 1% we have 1.4 million
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
uh population 14,000 patients um it is
 
00:55:02.109 --> 00:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
the lowest in the
 
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
country um so patient registrations have
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
plateaued over the years as you can see
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
um you know 2019 2020 we had uh saw
 
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
increases of 29 to 30% in terms of
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
patient registration in 2024 um there
 
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
was a
 
00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
3.7% increase in
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
patients um so the uh is it
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
we wonder is it saturated or are there
 
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
still barriers to access uh accessing
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
the program here in here in New
 
00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the majority of patients
 
00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%
are in their 50s and 60s this is
 
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
expected due to the you know the age of
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
chronic disease states that are uh that
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
are listed in the statute for qualifying
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
conditions we also have a very small
 
00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:50.839 align:start position:0%
number of minor patients on the program
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
um there are seven minors as of the uh
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
report date uh last uh last June um
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
so the uh the guard rails to
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
um appropriately certify minor patients
 
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:07.240 align:start position:0%
for the program are uh are
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
strong the vast majority of our patients
 
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh 83% are certified by their providers
 
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:15.640 align:start position:0%
for a pain condition if you look at page
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh 12 and 13 that starts the um the
 
00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh the qualifying conditions section
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
of the report other common conditions
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
the the top conditions are PTSD at 22%
 
00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
insomnia at 7% uh and cancer diagnosis
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh at 6% of the registered patients um
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
interestingly this this data is not
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
included in the report but um we have
 
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
approximately 450 new patients on the
 
00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:47.039 align:start position:0%
program since October 1st that have been
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
certified under
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
new condition categories that were voted
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
into into place by the legislature last
 
00:56:59.789 --> 00:56:59.799 align:start position:0%
session um so we have 400 new patients
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
um certified uh as having generalized
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
anxiety disorder and we have another 50
 
00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:08.039 align:start position:0%
patients uh certified under another
 
00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:11.319 align:start position:0%
category um of a provider discretion
 
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
basically any other condition that a
 
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
provider believes based on their
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
clinical opinion or the benefits out
 
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
weigh the risks so what this shows to me
 
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
is that there's an immediate impact um
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
on program numbers based on on uh
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
legislative action um to uh increase um
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh or expand uh condition types um
 
00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
you'll notice uh there are no bills this
 
00:57:39.630 --> 00:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
session uh that would propose to add a
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
new qualifying condition um the uh the
 
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
work done last session which allowed
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
providers full discretion to uh certify
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
patients over 21 mind you um for any
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
condition where they uh uh think it is
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
more beneficial than the risks um in my
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
opinion that's that uh will essentially
 
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
stop the the the legislation going
 
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:03.559 align:start position:0%
forward to add one condition here or one
 
00:58:03.559 --> 00:58:04.430 align:start position:0%
forward to add one condition here or one
condition

00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
condition
 
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.950 align:start position:0%
condition
there

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
um so on uh on page eight we have a a
 
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:14.039 align:start position:0%
graph about designated caregivers um so
 
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the number of caregivers in the
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
program has increased dramatically um
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
since uh since 20120 essentially
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
registration has uh has doubled from
 
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
about 500 to over a th000 um this means
 
00:58:26.589 --> 00:58:26.599 align:start position:0%
the patients have better better access
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
to the program via their caregivers um
 
00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:30.559 align:start position:0%
caregivers are allowed to legally
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
possess and purchase cannabis on their
 
00:58:36.029 --> 00:58:36.039 align:start position:0%
patients behalf um the program waved
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
caregiver application fees during covid
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
and then went back into uh rulem um and
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
eliminated the fee Al together um thus
 
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
reducing a barrier um and then uh the
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
legislature removed a requirement for
 
00:58:50.589 --> 00:58:50.599 align:start position:0%
caregivers to undergo a state and
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
federal background check including
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
Federal fingerprinting that was a $50
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
charge and also created a barrier for
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
caregivers to not want to be on a
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
federal registry say um based on their
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
their family or loved ones cannabis use
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
um so these are again these are aspects
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
that the um that the the legislature has
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
uh uh passed to reduce barriers to
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
access uh and make patients uh lives
 
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
better with respect to uh this
 
00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.109 align:start position:0%
better with respect to uh this
program

00:59:20.109 --> 00:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
um page nine talks about uh certifying
 
00:59:26.349 --> 00:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
medical providers uh there are over 14
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
100 medical providers um who have
 
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
certified at least one patient um as of
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
the report date uh we've seen increases
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
in provider participation uh throughout
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
the history of the program um but it is
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
still a common challenge for patients to
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
find providers to certify them this is a
 
00:59:46.029 --> 00:59:46.039 align:start position:0%
common uh question that we get um asked
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
at the department on a regular basis um
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire any provider is
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
authorized by law to certify but they're
 
00:59:56.349 --> 00:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
not mandated to certify of course um and
 
00:59:58.589 --> 00:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
many choose not to um so this is a
 
01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
particular challenge for uh a a portion
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
of our population veterans in particular
 
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
um who are receiving uh all of their
 
01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:08.200 align:start position:0%
medical care from the Veterans
 
01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:10.039 align:start position:0%
Administration uh those providers are
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
federally prohibited from certifying
 
01:00:14.029 --> 01:00:14.039 align:start position:0%
their patients um so we and we've got
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
about 9% of our patient base um uh who
 
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
are who self-report as veterans um so
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
that population is a population that has
 
01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh that needs to go out into the
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
community and find new doctors if they
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
want to participate in the program
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
because they don't have access uh
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
through their regular medical providers
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
that's not a unique problem um but it is
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
a particular problem for that for that
 
01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
group um let's see moving on to the
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center information
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
um I can share some highlights uh
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
product types cannabis strains have
 
01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:47.799 align:start position:0%
increased across the board over the
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
years including this past year product
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
costs have come down across all the
 
01:00:56.589 --> 01:00:56.599 align:start position:0%
atc's um over the the past year
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh however cost does Remain the number
 
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
one concern of patients
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
um because of the proximity to other
 
01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
states that have legalized cannabis um
 
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
in such a way that costs are very very
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
low outside of New Hampshire um high
 
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
prices here still contribute to a
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
crossborder um accessing of cannabis and
 
01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis products to uh New Hampshire
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
patients um
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
more than 30% of registered patients in
 
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
2024 never went to an apire ATC they
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
they are going out of state um
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
especially Maine where uh the medical
 
01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
marijuana program is not regulated by
 
01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
the state uh and thus because of its
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
lack of Regulation uh costs are very
 
01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
products um the ATC uh information goes
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
on um between 6 and 24% of patients have
 
01:02:02.029 --> 01:02:02.039 align:start position:0%
provided Effectiveness data um positive
 
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
outcomes are reported uh by 78 to 99%
 
01:02:09.069 --> 01:02:09.079 align:start position:0%
this is on page 15 um negative outcomes
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
are reported by 2% or less of patients
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
providing that
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
information uh and another area I'd like
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
to highlight is uh the alternative
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
treatment centers patient affordability
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
programs um nearly 30% of the patients
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
served by the atc's are registered with
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
the atc's patient affordability programs
 
01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:30.039 align:start position:0%
this includes uh patient uh recipients
 
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid um and individuals uh
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
receiving SSI or SSDI um the atcs also
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
allow um have programs for uh financial
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
hardship in general U they all provide
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
discounts to uh to Veterans um in 2024
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
these affordability discounts totaled
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
more than $1.1 million um across the uh
 
01:02:52.349 --> 01:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
the three ATC
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
operators um I'm happy to uh so yeah the
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
program is running smoothly um uh
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
efficiently registry ID cards are
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
getting out timely according to uh
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
statutory time frames um and I'm happy
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
questions I have one on page four and I
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
I certainly don't mean this in any
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
disrespectful way but I notice a
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
significant disparity between Coos and
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro and is there something that we
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
might need or want to know that could
 
01:03:28.029 --> 01:03:28.039 align:start position:0%
explain that uh so this is this is an
 
01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
area where we could present the data uh
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
somewhat differently on basically
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
adjusting it for um the age of the
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
population um that disparity if you will
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
is directly related to the uh the age of
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
the population in those uh two counties
 
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
that's helpful thank you anyone uh
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
Senator gray
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
so it I believe that you said that there
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
were one of the lowest in the nation for
 
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
people taking advantage of this
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
program the hypothesis that I would came
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
up with was that it is cheaper and
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
easier to get it not through your
 
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
program and it appears that your later
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
testimony saying Main's
 
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
price uh even though it's illegal to
 
01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
bring it across the back across the
 
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
border it help help to justify that
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
hypothesis want to comment or I would
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
agree with your assessment um I also I
 
01:04:35.549 --> 01:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
also believe that the uh the development
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
of the program over the years as a as a
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
very restricted program limited program
 
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the the the number of
 
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
qualifying conditions and the types of
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
qualifying conditions um had a uh had an
 
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
effect to uh reduce uptake along the way
 
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
um and as other states uh developed
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
their you know legalized cannabis for
 
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
adult use
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
um patients who could not patients
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
people who were self interested in
 
01:05:02.029 --> 01:05:02.039 align:start position:0%
self-medicating perhaps you know did not
 
01:05:04.589 --> 01:05:04.599 align:start position:0%
need this program because they were able
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
to get it out of state um when they
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't access this program based on uh
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
the qualifying conditions that were
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
listed in the law um PTSD was a later
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
add-on um uh chronic pain you know as we
 
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
as we see you know 83% of our patients
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
you know are certified for a pain
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
condition um chronic pain didn't come um
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
was added to the to the list until uh
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
2019 I believe so 3 years after
 
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
operations so um but yes I I agree with
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
your your assessment of the the the
 
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
levers thank you representative
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
looking at page 11 uh and just scanning
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
through the report it seems like
 
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
statistics seem to follow counties by
 
01:05:57.309 --> 01:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
population it does and um but on page 11
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
uh Marx the third largest county but
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
Grafton seems to Eclipse it in terms of
 
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
number of providers and I was just
 
01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
wondering if you might know why that
 
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
is Dartmouth oh Dart okay Dartmouth and
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that answers
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
it and while we're on the same page I
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
see 404 different
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
providers only have one person certified
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
but we get down to the bottom of that
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
column and 17 providers have a 100 or
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
more I'm my guess is this depends on
 
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
their medical Subs specialty and if that
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
is true could you break out who are the
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
most frequent providers by medical Subs
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
specialty uh if you go to page 10 um the
 
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
page before it does we do list
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
Physicians by specialty um Pas don't
 
01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
have Specialties um so they're not
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
included on that list um and you can see
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
that uh the top two are Family Medicine
 
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
Internal Medicine um and that aligns
 
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
with that aligns with the top of the
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
graph on the bottom of page 11 where you
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
know if you look at the first two
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
categories of patient certified 1 to 10
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
or 1 to n the vast majority over a
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
thousand of the of the of the 1,400
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
providers um are certifying between one
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
and nine patients these are these are
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
patients going to their pcps right and
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
being certified in the way that the
 
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
program would much prefer people to be
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
certified you know in uh where talk to
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
your PCP about your interest in the
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
program integrate this alternative
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
therapy uh with um your uh your regular
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
Continuum of Care with your uh with your
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh primary care provider or your
 
01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
specialist and so the the top of that
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
graph I think is very instructive about
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
the model that New Hampshire has chosen
 
01:07:51.549 --> 01:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
um to focus uh the true Bonafide
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
provider patient relationship uh and and
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
enforce that in this program when we get
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of the list um there are
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
doctors and providers who have business
 
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
models that advertise cannabis
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
certification um and these are these
 
01:08:11.789 --> 01:08:11.799 align:start position:0%
these providers are are are few in the
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire unlike other
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
states like Massachusetts where not
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
everyone but they have a different model
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
and that the Massachusetts model uh
 
01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
lends itself to pot doctors uh that are
 
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
issuing cards based on a Health visit um
 
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
and a claim of back pain right um in new
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does have providers who do
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
advertise cannabis certification as part
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
of their service array but they're a
 
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
limited number those names are in the
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
public space um these other providers
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
that other providers who don't want to
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
certify their patients um send them to
 
01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
and so that's why we see some of these
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
providers you know 17 in total having
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
more than 100 patients
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
um so that that that explains that that
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
those those numbers um it doesn't answer
 
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
your specific question about their
 
01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
specialty um uh but it does explain the
 
01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
uh the category
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
itself my guess it would be the more
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
painful the disease is the more likely
 
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
this could happen whereas many people go
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
to their PCP for a lot of other
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
different things where this would not be
 
01:09:21.199 --> 01:09:22.030 align:start position:0%
different things where this would not be
in

01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
play runny noses and things like that
 
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
scrap Doos yeah right okay any yeah
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
Senator rosenal thank you very much we
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
know that cost is a barrier for the
 
01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:40.030 align:start position:0%
know that cost is a barrier for the
patients

01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
um but the good part of being in this
 
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.149 align:start position:0%
um but the good part of being in this
program

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
is there's kind of confidence about the
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
quality of the product that's free of
 
01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.790 align:start position:0%
quality of the product that's free of
pesticide

01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
pesticide
 
01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.870 align:start position:0%
pesticide
and

01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
herbicides uh is there anything that you
 
01:10:06.189 --> 01:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
would recommend that we could do to
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:20.669 --> 01:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
barrier the program and the department
 
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
is not in a position
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
to say we want to increase patient
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
numbers necessarily we don't want more
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
people being sick we want to be able to
 
01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
reduce barriers so that if patients want
 
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
access to the program they can have a
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
conversation with their medical
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
providers and their providers have
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
confidence uh in this as an alternative
 
01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.510 align:start position:0%
confidence uh in this as an alternative
therapy

01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
so but but more numbers more more
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
patients mean that three companies that
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
sell cannabis and cannabis products uh
 
01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
have more patient to sell their product
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
to that creates economies of scale uh
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
that creates lower prices so there's a
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
direct correlation between the number of
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
patients on the roles the number of
 
01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
patients who actually go to the New
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire atcs and don't go out of state
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh and the cost that the atcs are able
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
to um uh charge for their products so
 
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
there are in this legislative session um
 
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
a number of bills um that are being
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
proposed that would have a
 
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
midterm impact
 
01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.870 align:start position:0%
midterm impact
on

01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
prices uh one of the bills would allow
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh the atcs to Outsource nontox non-
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
intoxicating hemp derived cannabinoids
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
like CBD instead of having to spend
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
their resources growing it themselves so
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
if they could Outsource that uh CBD is
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
legal federally if they could Outsource
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
that um they could include CBD in their
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
products at a much much lower cost to
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
patients um so that's a bill that's uh
 
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh was heard before the uh
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
hhsa committee um pass and I I'm not
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
sure if it's passed the full house yet
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
or not um there's another bill that
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
would allow the atcs to
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh do conduct Greenhouse cultivation
 
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse cultivation certainly a large
 
01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
capital investment in the facility but
 
01:12:29.950 --> 01:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
the production costs once established
 
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
come way down because of electricity you
 
01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
they'll be using the sun to grow product
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
the plant as opposed to uh um uh
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
artificial light um there's another bill
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
that proposes to allow the alternative
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
treatment centers to convert to a
 
01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
for-profit status um based on the vote
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
of their boards right it's not a it's
 
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
not a faded compete that they all would
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
the the boards would have to vote on
 
01:12:59.070 --> 01:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
that again and and that would allow them
 
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
to uh they say uh to reinvest um uh
 
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
restructure their businesses to reinvest
 
01:13:08.189 --> 01:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
in uh uh in their programs here um and
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
lower prices so there are there are
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
lever that are that are open to you as a
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
legislator to um to act to reduce those
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
those prices to patients um and uh we
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
don't you know obvious we don't take
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
positions on those bills but I'm here to
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
say that I believe that all three of
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
those will lower prices for
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
Weber am I right chairman McDonald that
 
01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
the um the grow houses and the um uh
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids I think went went through
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
the house and went onto the consent
 
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
calendar I believe so and the for-profit
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
status was wrestled with a bit more and
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
maybe awaiting an appearance on a
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
calendar is that HB 54 Mr Hulk do you
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
remember I believe it is I think we exec
 
01:14:05.629 --> 01:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
that just this past
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
week no I think it was yes I believe it
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
was U unanimous 18 to Zer in favor of it
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
and it will go to the house next maybe
 
01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
it was this week I'm not sure it was
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
either this week or last week actually
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
that may been the bill yesterday I'm
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
trying to remember I know that we all of
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis bills are before our
 
01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
committee we passed ex favorably except
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
um the one that we give veterans the op
 
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
the free card that was the only one we
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
did not approve everything else we did
 
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
approve from mainly representative um
 
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
Thomas was the sponsor was all of those
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
so my my point was that they're all off
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
to the Senate yes yes and will be
 
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
arriving shortly I would add the
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
department has done its part we've we've
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
never raised a fee in the history of the
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
program we've eliminated fees or low
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
lowered fees um in fact uh recently
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
we've um the legislature passed you know
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
allowed for a three-year certification
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
um instead of an annual certification we
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
didn't raise our rates our fees so it's
 
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
$50 it used to be $50 every year um it's
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
now $50 for three years um and so I
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
believe all these all the these efforts
 
01:15:19.149 --> 01:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
the lower prices you know from the atcs
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
our not low raising our fees have
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
contributed to the the the small but
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
steady growth and um and not a decline
 
01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
registrations seeing no further
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%

know annual report of the therapeutic
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%

board thank you again for the record my

cannabis medical oversight board he
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%

asked him if he wanted to come and he
 
01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
said that a three-hour roundtrip drive
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
for a five to 10 minute presentation was
 
01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh oh and he was taking care of his
 
01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
grandkids today that may be a more
 
01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
compelling uh reason to not uh to not be
 
01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
here um he did uh he legitimately sent
 
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.480 align:start position:0%

see all of his friends here
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
again um so um the board met three times
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
in 2024 and focused on legisla
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
activities primarily as well as uh um
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
educational material um legislatively
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
they reviewed proposed legislation for
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
the 24 session the available lsrs for
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
the 25 session um they researched uh in
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
medical literature various topics uh and
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
uh then provided their clinical
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
expertise and guidance through testimony
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
of the legislature um last year and this
 
01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
year uh there are some broad themes in
 
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
terms of the board's positions on on
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
various bills um they uh they focused on
 
01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
on on bills that had CL clinical
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
components um including bills that as we
 
01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
talked about previously would have added
 
01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh new qualifying conditions um it's not
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
a rubber stamp uh they they do do their
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
due diligence and and and looking at
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
those conditions they um they uh they
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
supported adding generalized anxiety
 
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
disorder but did not support adding uh
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
Eating Disorders generally
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
um and as I mentioned earlier they did
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
support the bill that provided uh
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
medical providers uh discretion in
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
certifying patients for any condition
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
based on their clinical opinion
 
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
basically it sets up a a different
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
approach um uh providers have to sign on
 
01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
a dotted line saying that in their
 
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
clinical opinion um benefits outweigh
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
the risks um they also uh focused on
 
01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
bills that impacted patient access to
 
01:18:24.189 --> 01:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
the program because if patients don't
 
01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
have access then they can't gain a
 
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
clinical benefit from the program so
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
they oppose limits on THC concentrations
 
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
in therapeutic products they oppose
 
01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
criminalizing possession of unsealed
 
01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis containers and
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
vehicles for patients uh they oppose THC
 
01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
blood concentration in patients due to a
 
01:18:49.629 --> 01:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
lack of a scientific evidence um and uh
 
01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
and they they supported home cultivation
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh for uh for patients uh inste of r W
 
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
actually that reminds me home
 
01:19:01.709 --> 01:19:01.719 align:start position:0%
cultivation um is is another bill uh
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
common perennial Bill and coming and it
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
comes every year and that is a bill that
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
would absolutely lower costs for
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
patients it would not increase the sales
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily to the atcs um but it would
 
01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
certainly a lower cost for patients if
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
they could grow their own um and the the
 
01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
tcob um has has supported that policy
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
change for a couple years now um that
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
was one that was one we voted on
 
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday yeah that's right that's
 
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
right on your
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
way so uh the bills this year 2025 we
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
we've uh mentioned them they they
 
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
supported um the various legislation
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
that improves ATC operations um to the
 
01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:41.719 align:start position:0%
benefit of patients primarily lowering
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
costs uh the hemp dve cannaboid Bill uh
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
the greenhouse cultivation bill um and
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh like I said home cultivation and uh
 
01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
possession limits uh to increase the
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
patients access to cannabis and so they
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to drive as many
 
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
times far away over an hour to a an ATC
 
01:20:03.629 --> 01:20:03.639 align:start position:0%
location um the educational material
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
that they focused on this past year was
 
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
the risks of cannabis use in adolescence
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
um they uh the board finished their work
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
on this um they conducted L literature
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
reviews scientific evidence about the
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
specific risks of cannabis use to this
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
specific vulnerable
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
population um and uh the board also
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
worked on messaging uh this uh risks to
 
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
the uh to the population uh this work
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
product is penic one in the report um
 
01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
and the department is now working on
 
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
converting the information gathered into
 
01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh digestible population friendly
 
01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
documents you poster and brochures to be
 
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
available at the alternative treatment
 
01:20:45.149 --> 01:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
centers um to make available to their uh
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
their uh their patients there um I
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
expect this work to be done in a couple
 
01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.830 align:start position:0%
expect this work to be done in a couple
months

01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
um happy to answer questions about the
 
01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
operations of the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
board seeing no questions thank you for
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
your reports thank you very
 
01:21:11.629 --> 01:21:11.639 align:start position:0%
much and uh off the agenda until I just
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
put it on Senator gray for a suggestion
 
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
for this committee to consider enacting
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we are not
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
overseeing is their
 
01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
budget I think that right now the uh
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
state is projecting that the lapse is
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
going to come in uh $47 million less
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
than what the laps would normally come
 
01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
in and if I look at
 
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
HHS that could be as much as $15 million
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
of that from that one Department um so
 
01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
we need to find a way to at least do
 
01:21:54.189 --> 01:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
some kind of oversight um of their
 
01:21:54.199 --> 01:21:55.709 align:start position:0%
some kind of oversight um of their
budget

01:21:55.709 --> 01:21:55.719 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:21:58.950 --> 01:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh certainly every two years it becomes
 
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
a big thing if they don't make the laps
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
um and it affects multiple departments
 
01:22:07.629 --> 01:22:07.639 align:start position:0%
so I'm not saying how it should be done
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
or what it should be done I think that
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
Mr White has some ideas uh and some
 
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
discussion points and so I'd like to see
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
it on the agenda for the next time uh to
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
Weber and I just want to make a p
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
comment that although it looks like we
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
may actually finish up early this time
 
01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
it's the first time I can remember that
 
01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
happening in three or four years this
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
committee is strained to the limit for
 
01:22:49.229 --> 01:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
the amount of information it can take in
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
think about process deal with refer to
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
other people and comment on and we have
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
a very rigorous budget process in both
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate whose job it is
 
01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
to focus on exactly what Senator gray is
 
01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
talking about with people who work with
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
those figures every minute of every day
 
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
or practically and most of the night as
 
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
well and I think for this body to take
 
01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.790 align:start position:0%
well and I think for this body to take
that

01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
on uh with our far more limited
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge except for those members who
 
01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
actually sit on the relevant budget
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
committees in the House and
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
Senate is um a duplication of effort
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
with far less useful Personnel to take
 
01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
it on but that having been said I am
 
01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
more than willing to discuss it further
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
on representative Woods um thank thank
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I I was going to make
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
basically the same comments but uh would
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
the senator have any particular areas in
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
mind uh that we could be attentive to
 
01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
where the our role would enhance the
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
process as we examine the budget and if
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
so what would those areas be I if I look
 
01:24:20.350 --> 01:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
at the Senate uh finance committee
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
certainly historically there's been two
 
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
of us from the Senate finance committee
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
on this me you know the Senate Finance
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
does not go down and try to stay up on
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
each one of the Departments and if I
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
look at the charter of this
 
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
committee okay maybe it needs to be
 
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
broken into two if it's you know maybe
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
we need to have two meetings a month
 
01:24:50.109 --> 01:24:50.119 align:start position:0%
again I want to have a discussion
 
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
because I don't believe that finance
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
committee either in the house of the
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
Senate is the right one to provide
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
oversight when I have a committee that's
 
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
charged with that
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
oversight so again we'll have the
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
discussion next month you know everybody
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
can air out their laundry uh but as a as
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
a finance committee you know I don't go
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
into each one of the Departments you
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
know for a$1 15.2 billion budget you
 
01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
know and oversee it okay I think that
 
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
there may be something that we can do um
 
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
of a smaller nature a report you know
 
01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
that that won't take a lot a lot of time
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh but when I come to the last six
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
months in a budget cycle last five
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
months in a budget
 
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
cycle and I'm maybe I don't know what
 
01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
the number is I may be $15 million short
 
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
in my
 
01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
laps I don't think we've done our due
 
01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.990 align:start position:0%
laps I don't think we've done our due
diligence

01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
diligence
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm willing to wait till next month
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
would you suggest that the chairman of
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
house finance be part of this
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
discussion chairman of Senate Finance
 
01:26:14.189 --> 01:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
some folks some DHHS and ourselves in
 
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
this um beginnings of threshing it out
 
01:26:21.390 --> 01:26:21.400 align:start position:0%
certainly I would not you know tell the
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
house what to do the chair of Senate
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
Finance is here the ranking member of
 
01:26:32.669 --> 01:26:32.679 align:start position:0%
the opposition Senate Finance is here so
 
01:26:35.709 --> 01:26:35.719 align:start position:0%
again throw it out there this month and
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
have the discussion next
 
01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
month Senator thank you I mean I I don't
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
disagree at all with Senator gray
 
01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
that we need to keep more on top of
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
how the spending of the
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
Appropriations is going over the two
 
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
years what I have found is
 
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
that the executive branch is not
 
01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.470 align:start position:0%
that the executive branch is not
always

01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
cooperative and I'm sorry to say that
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
but if you
 
01:27:21.390 --> 01:27:21.400 align:start position:0%
ask how's the laps
 
01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:24.280 align:start position:0%
looking it looks to us like it's going
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
to be $40 million less we sometimes hear
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
oh no it'll be fine so I hope that we
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
could get the executive
 
01:27:42.189 --> 01:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
branch to
 
01:27:42.199 --> 01:27:44.390 align:start position:0%
branch to
be

01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
participating in that because they're
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
the ones
 
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
who are you know they put the hiring
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
freeze on they control the lab
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
they do stuff behind the curtains
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
that we tend to find out about later
 
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.510 align:start position:0%
that we tend to find out about later
and

01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:11.629 --> 01:28:11.639 align:start position:0%
um I'll just stop as one who likes to
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
try to find middling
 
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
ground uh taking to Heart both Senator
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
gray and representative Weber's comments
 
01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:23.719 align:start position:0%
I think at least this committee should
 
01:28:27.109 --> 01:28:27.119 align:start position:0%
be involved to some degree in looking at
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
it I'm not suggesting necessarily we
 
01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
take it over but right now we're way
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
over here where we don't do anything
 
01:28:39.109 --> 01:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
with the finances we look at policy we
 
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
receive reports and yeah I think we
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
should do some more somewhere in the
 
01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.950 align:start position:0%
should do some more somewhere in the
middle

01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
middle
 
01:28:50.189 --> 01:28:50.199 align:start position:0%
um perhaps next month we can carve out
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
at the end of the meeting some time
 
01:28:57.149 --> 01:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
to look at this more
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
fully representative
 
01:29:02.109 --> 01:29:02.119 align:start position:0%
McDonald one suggestion I would have is
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps you want to talk to Chairman wer
 
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:06.280 align:start position:0%
on the finance committee do that sure
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
and um see what he thinks of it I mean I
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
know right now they're and as the Senate
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
soon will be stretch pretty thin with
 
01:29:16.030 --> 01:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
with this whole process but uh whether
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
they became a formal member or not is
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
questionable uh in terms of its
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
feasibility right now but maybe you at
 
01:29:23.709 --> 01:29:23.719 align:start position:0%
least want to run that idea by him and
 
01:29:27.149 --> 01:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
see what his thoughts are we'll do Mr as
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
well as representative Edwards is I was
 
01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
to say representative Edwards chairs
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
division three he's not here right now
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
because they're in the middle of the
 
01:29:38.189 --> 01:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
budget process but he is in a position
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
to talk very knowledgeably about the
 
01:29:44.109 --> 01:29:44.119 align:start position:0%
depth into which division 3 plums The
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
Depths and as one who was watching
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
somebody do it the downstairs earlier um
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
because there are so many more people on
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
the finance committee in the house than
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
in the Senate the depth into which the
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
department budgets are explored is
 
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:06.280 align:start position:0%
significantly more on this side than the
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
other side now the specific issue of the
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
lapses is is a separate question and the
 
01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
issue of um obtaining timely information
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
is another question but I I think that
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
that I would be a lot more comfortable
 
01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about that kind of
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
communication and process issues rather
 
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
than rep plowing ground that I think at
 
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:39.400 align:start position:0%
least in the house is already being
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
plowed uh but I agree that finding out
 
01:30:45.629 --> 01:30:45.639 align:start position:0%
exactly who who is plowing what is a
 
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
very worthwhile Enterprise and I think
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
that that's the starting point and even
 
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
if indeed I take the point that finance
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
division three is is quite large and
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
they go into quite a bit of depth I find
 
01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
out about it when all the other members
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
of the House find out about it and I
 
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
would think as oversight we might be
 
01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
involved somehow Senator rosenal well so
 
01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
also while they're really busy now
 
01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
building the next state
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
budget here we are 34s of the way
 
01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
through it
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
and um just finding out basically last
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
week that the lapses are not what would
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
thought they would be there's an $81
 
01:31:42.189 --> 01:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
million deficit you know on and on
 
01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
so keeping on top of how it's going over
 
01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
the two
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
years is really
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
important whether this committee is the
 
01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
place to do it or whether the finance
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
committees are the place to do it or
 
01:32:02.669 --> 01:32:02.679 align:start position:0%
even the fiscal committee I guess is
 
01:32:06.109 --> 01:32:06.119 align:start position:0%
probably what we should discuss but you
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
know once once that budget's put to get
 
01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.709 align:start position:0%
know once once that budget's put to get
to

01:32:11.709 --> 01:32:11.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
bed I don't know to what extent the
 
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
implementation good point representative
 
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
Woods oh thank you I think um my sense
 
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
is at the moment
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
that for this bium it would be much too
 
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
big a task to be a unless there's some
 
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:39.400 align:start position:0%
obvious need that would come up but it
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
may well be that if in fact we have a
 
01:32:45.629 --> 01:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place at this committee to
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
look at designated segments then come
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
the next by we could potentially be a
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
very good player and very helpful both
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
to HHS and to the budget committee uh
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
but I guess I I I'm a little hesitant
 
01:33:07.950 --> 01:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
about moving too fast and creating
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps more dust than than good as I
 
01:33:14.669 --> 01:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
put together my guest list um
 
01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
representative walner is the ranking
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
member of Finance
 
01:33:23.070 --> 01:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
three Finance en of Finance entirely how
 
01:33:27.070 --> 01:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:29.470 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:33:33.149 --> 01:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
probably I I can chat with her we we we
 
01:33:33.159 --> 01:33:34.430 align:start position:0%
probably I I can chat with her we we we
chat

01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
chat
 
01:33:36.109 --> 01:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
periodically get
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
along sure just can't go there because I
 
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
he look at up because she's taking notes
 
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
Senator gray I'm not opposed to having
 
01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
this meeting outside of our monthly
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
meeting here um you know that would not
 
01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
bother me at all
 
01:33:56.669 --> 01:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
but is there anybody in this room right
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
now knowing that the projection is $47
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
million how much part of that $47
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
million is actually Health and Human
 
01:34:10.669 --> 01:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
hand since I don't see any hands going
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
up then somebody needs to provide that
 
01:34:19.629 --> 01:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
oversight could you kindly state that
 
01:34:21.629 --> 01:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
question again because I'm not going to
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
get it right and I can't type that fast
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's fine is just say it again knowing
 
01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
that the estimate for the lapse is
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
$47 million
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
how much of
 
01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:00.090 align:start position:0%
that is attributable
 
01:35:00.090 --> 01:35:01.430 align:start position:0%
that is attributable
[Music]

01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
to Health and Human Services thank you I
 
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
can check with her and let the record
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
show that nobody's hand went
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
so go
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
ahead uh representative Weber if I may
 
01:35:22.990 --> 01:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
ask a question uh it the way the
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
committee list
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
usually are is the first listed Democrat
 
01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
usually the ranking member on the that's
 
01:35:29.550 --> 01:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
correct so I believe it would be
 
01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
representative laa tki although
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
representative wner was also listed but
 
01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
she's listed after representative chorki
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
in division three ex offici and I think
 
01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps like representative Wier
 
01:35:43.629 --> 01:35:43.639 align:start position:0%
although I'm not sure representative
 
01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:46.360 align:start position:0%
Wier is on all of the divisions and I
 
01:35:48.669 --> 01:35:48.679 align:start position:0%
think it's quite possible that uh
 
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
representative wner is also on all of
 
01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
the divisions uh in so far as she they
 
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
are able to split themselves into pieces
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
but um I I think I think I would check
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
with both uh representatives walner and
 
01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
tersi and they can work it out perhaps
 
01:36:07.229 --> 01:36:07.239 align:start position:0%
among themselves as to who is the best
 
01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
person to speak about these particular
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
concerns and to to your point
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative wer was also listed in
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
division three along with representative
 
01:36:18.669 --> 01:36:18.679 align:start position:0%
wner so when I had one of my wonderful
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
bills go to finance
 
01:36:25.149 --> 01:36:25.159 align:start position:0%
3 um rep representative walner was
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
present and very helpful so she was in
 
01:36:35.229 --> 01:36:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I would like to
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
um have this is the last item on the
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
agenda next
 
01:36:44.239 --> 01:36:46.550 align:start position:0%
agenda next
month

01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
um without objection or with only a few
 
01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
objections I have no objection to the
 
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.470 align:start position:0%
objections I have no objection to the
discussion

01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
right I
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
just sorry I I have no objection at all
 
01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
to the discussion I think it's a very
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
useful and productive one as I first
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
heard the proposal it sounded very much
 
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
like a duplication
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
of what does happen um I am now clearer
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
that there is a slightly different focus
 
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
and whether or not I believe that this
 
01:37:26.669 --> 01:37:26.679 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate place to do it it's
 
01:37:29.709 --> 01:37:29.719 align:start position:0%
certainly well worth talking about
 
01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
so represent as represent as Senator
 
01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
gray says it's doesn't appear to be
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
being done anywhere else so if if this
 
01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
is in the place perhaps finding a place
 
01:37:43.589 --> 01:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
is a good discussion to
 
01:37:47.709 --> 01:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
have Senator Rosenwald thank you I think
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
that the statute for this committee
 
01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
gives you the authority to appoint
 
01:37:57.950 --> 01:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittees as you choose we heard
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
from one today yes and so you could
 
01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.709 align:start position:0%
from one today yes and so you could
create

01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
create
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
a HHS budget oversight
 
01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that could be composed
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
of anybody I mean not anybody but
 
01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
be only from the members of this
 
01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.109 align:start position:0%
be only from the members of this
committee

01:38:24.109 --> 01:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is we put this item last
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
on the agenda because I'm sure um
 
01:38:32.589 --> 01:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
attorney uh Williams has already got a
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
choca block thing from March I've seen
 
01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
it but if we put it last and say look
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
we're probably going after 3:00 on this
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
prepare to stay if you're really
 
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
interested in this subject um prepare to
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
stay after
 
01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
3:00 and if you're not you're not and if
 
01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
you are please stay and
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
that we'll come up with something don't
 
01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:56.109 align:start position:0%
that we'll come up with something don't
s

01:38:56.109 --> 01:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
else we all owe this committee 22
 
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.390 align:start position:0%
else we all owe this committee 22
minutes

01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
wow I think the committee ow owes us
 
01:39:14.109 --> 01:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
some for prior meetings and um I think I
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
think we're doe some time off and
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
L representative you may have the rest
 
01:39:22.030 --> 01:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
