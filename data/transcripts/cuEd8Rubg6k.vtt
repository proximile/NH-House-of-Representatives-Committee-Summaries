is and his counterparts in the Northeast
 
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
have a nonprofit that we basically do a
 
00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
bunch of research work for and I've been
 
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
working for them for about 25 years and
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
under that we have this program that's
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
been going on for a couple years called
 
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
securing Northeast Forest carbon program
 
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
it's that logo up on the screen uh and
 
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
that program is designed essentially to
 
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
educate any and all those interested in
 
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
Forest carbon Forest carbon science and
 
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
Forest carbon markets that's what we've
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
been up to for a couple years in a seven
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
state region of New York and New England
 
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
so this comes from that greater
 
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
geography uh I'm bringing it to you my
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
day job is actually uh as uh the
 
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
president of a small nonprofit small
 
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
Consulting organization based in New
 
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we have offices in Maine
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
as well Innovative natural resource
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
Solutions so I point you to our website
 
00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 align:start position:0%
for securing Northeast Forest carbon
 
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
here it is Northeast Forest caron.org
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
everything I'm going to be talking about
 
00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
and more is at that website so consider
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
consider it a resource for you and for
 
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
everybody else about the topic uh that
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to cover today we've tried
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
to be thorough there's no other single
 
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
place where you can get all this
 
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
information uh to educate you and others
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
on Forest carbon and Forest carbon
 
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
markets so I'm going to start a little
 
00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 align:start position:0%
bit by talking about Connecticut Lakes
 
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
because that's where all this comes from
 
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
the bill that you have before you I I
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
wear another hat in that I am a member
 
00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
of the citizens committee the
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lake Headwater citizens
 
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
committee which is a statutory committee
 
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
that came out of the project starting in
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
2003 and the map you have before you is
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut Lakes property uh I'm
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
not sure I think you can see the colors
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
up there you can see it certainly in
 
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
your paper copies so um this is the the
 
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
part of geography of New Hampshire that
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
this proper property sits North is
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
Canada to the east is Maine and to the
 
00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
West is really Canada and Vermont down
 
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
in the bottom leftand corner to give you
 
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
some sense it's the very Northern tip of
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and just some brief
 
00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:06.759 align:start position:0%
history and then I'll jump into Forest
 
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
carbon in 2001 um a nonprofit National
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofit called the trust for public
 
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 align:start position:0%
land uh got an option on what was then
 
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
owned by International Paper Company at
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
the time it was
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
171,00 acres and it took two years to
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
put together a conservation project that
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
resulted in what we have today so coming
 
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:31.879 align:start position:0%
out out of that uh
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
146,00 Acres uh went to a private
 
00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:36.879 align:start position:0%
landowner the Connecticut Lakes realy
 
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
trust which was lime Timber at the time
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
now this is a rural sustainable lands
 
00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:42.759 align:start position:0%
which you heard about at the first
 
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
hearing on this uh and the intent was
 
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
that that property subject to a
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
conservation easement would be managed
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
as a working force producing Timber
 
00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:53.879 align:start position:0%
essentially in
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
perpetuity also as part of that deal and
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
very unique arrangement in that the
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire through uh
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural cultural resources
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
essentially acquired the main Gravel
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
Road system in that
 
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
46,4 Acres it's you won't see this
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
anywhere else it's about 269 miles of
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
the 424 gravel road miles on that
 
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
property and and also as part of that
 
00:08:24.029 --> 00:08:24.039 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire uh retained
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
all the recreation rights so all the
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
recreation that goes on in this property
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
um again privately owned by now Aurora
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
sustainable lands LLC is owned by the
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and managed uh
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
along with the RADS so also at that time
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
25,000 acres and if you've got your map
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
on the piece of paper you can see a
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
different color greenish color uh that
 
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
25,000 Acres was deeded uh in fee to the
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and managed now
 
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
by the fish and game department and it
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
was the the most highly sensitive lands
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
at the time that were set aside um just
 
00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
a side note fishing game actually does
 
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
harvest some Timber on that land as well
 
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's wildli directed but there are
 
00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
ongoing harvests that go on on that that
 
00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
property as well again owned by the
 
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire another 100 acres
 
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
which you can't really see anywhere uh
 
00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
but if you've been to the North country
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
and you know this property there uh
 
00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
there is a campground managed by the
 
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire Deer Mountain
 
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
Campground 100 acres was deeded to the
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
state around that Campground for future
 
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.110 align:start position:0%
state around that Campground for future
expansion

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
and that's really what happened so who
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
paid for all this you all did in part at
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
the time uh the capital budget had $10
 
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
million in it along with $2 million from
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
elip and then the federal government put
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
in a like amount from the forest Legacy
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
program and lime Timber bought the
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
underlying fee to balance out the full
 
00:09:54.509 --> 00:09:54.519 align:start position:0%
uh amount of dollars raised which was
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
$45 million in 2003 to make this
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
property happen so that's a little
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
background on the property thought it
 
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to to get some history
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
so lime Timber owned
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
146,00 Acres again the yellow on the map
 
00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:13.959 align:start position:0%
uh until 2009 then the forest Land Group
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
purchased it and owned it until 2
 
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:20.839 align:start position:0%
2022 and that's when uh Aurora
 
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
sustainable lands at the time blue
 
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
Source purchased uh the property uh and
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
continues to own it so a little history
 
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
there thought would be helpful to start
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
out I'm going to jump into Forest
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
carbon and before we get into talking
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
about the markets there's a there's a
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
little bit of the science that just as
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
reminders it's helpful to understand so
 
00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
as we think about what's being bought
 
00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:46.519 align:start position:0%
and sold here so remember from your high
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
school biology uh thinking about what
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
trees and plants do in photosynthesis
 
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
right they take in carbon dioxide plus
 
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
water plus sunlight with chlorophyll and
 
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
they produce food sugars essentially and
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
they also uh emit oxygen for us to
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
breathe so uh through that process in in
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
the process of photosynthesis the tree
 
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
grows and half of the wood part of the
 
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
tree or really the biomass of the tree
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh is uh in terms of the dry weight is
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
carbon okay and so that's what
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
everybody's after is the fact that these
 
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
plants take CO2 out of the air that's a
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas
 
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh and and the most ubiquitous one and
 
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh and in fact stores it long term in
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
the trees and that's what's getting paid
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
for in the markets um understand however
 
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
that you know in climates like ours
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
where we have winter these trees
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
actually kind of shut down in the
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
wintertime they're not sequestering
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
carbon I'll talk about the terms after
 
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
but they're not doing that during the
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
wintertime but they more than make up
 
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
for it during the summertime when trees
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
are growing uh and so that overtime time
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
if you see the slide I have up here uh
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
that graph on the bottom right don't
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
need to know the details but that upward
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
trajectory is showing the increasing
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
carbon over time the x-axis is is time
 
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
so that's what happens so the trees
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
don't die in the winter they shut down
 
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
and during that time they're still alive
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
and they actually give off more carbon
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
dioxide during the during that that
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
close period Then they take in because
 
00:12:28.189 --> 00:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
they're not doing photosynthesis so
 
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's why you see that Jagged red line
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
on the graph down there so a little
 
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
background science on there that I
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
thought it'd be helpful so a few key
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
terms in this field that we need to talk
 
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
about carbon storage in terms of forest
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
is the carbon stored in the trees
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
primarily in the wood but don't forget
 
00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
we've got branches and leaves and all
 
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
those smaller parts of the tree but
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
that's the storage that is the tree
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
taking in the CO2 in the past it it
 
00:12:58.829 --> 00:12:58.839 align:start position:0%
shows up as the as the plant looks like
 
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
today carbon sequestration is actually
 
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
the tree's active activity of taking in
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
that carbon dioxide and once it does
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
that and creates the sugars and the wood
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
then that turns into carbon storage but
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
it's the sequestration that is equally
 
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
as important I think it's more important
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
simply because it's taking out CO2 from
 
00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:22.519 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere today and that's what
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
we're all concerned about right with the
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions that are
 
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
happening today the carbon storage is
 
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
great we don't want to release that but
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
the sequestration is the active part of
 
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
it that we're most concerned about
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions as we know can come
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
from any kind of entity that uh Burns
 
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
any kind of fuel we talk about fossil
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
fuels but just remember to be honest
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
when you burn wood in your wood stove I
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
have two in my house we're releasing uh
 
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide greenhouse gases the
 
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
atmosphere as part of that so that's
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
that stored carbon in the tree that is
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
now getting released however if we take
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
that same wood and we make it into a
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
table like these tables that gets stored
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
for a long long time continues to be
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
stored so that's something to take into
 
00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:08.519 align:start position:0%
account I'll touch on that again so the
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
key thing is this thing called carbon
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
flux in the Box on the right uh on on
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
this slide and that is what is the
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
difference between the sequestration in
 
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
in a time period and usually we talk
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
about a year and the emissions because
 
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
trees again give off uh carbon dioxide
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
as part of respiration because they are
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
alive and that difference is the carbon
 
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
flux a negative carbon flux means that
 
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
the tree is taking in more carbon
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
dioxide then it's giving off in a time
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
period usually we talk about a year so a
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
negative carbon flux is a good thing
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
because that's that's really what trees
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh trees are doing and a little bit in
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
the way of Statistics here because this
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
project is looking at this this
 
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
geography that you see before you New
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
York and New England is that the region
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
as a whole and and on this map uh if you
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
can see colors the darker the green the
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
higher density of the carbon and Timber
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
essentially that's what this is showing
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
you'll notice in northern Maine uh it's
 
00:15:09.749 --> 00:15:09.759 align:start position:0%
a lighter color because the density of
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
trees there because that the state has
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
harvested more of its wood over time is
 
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
less so than it is in most of New
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but anyways this this uh shows
 
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit of data in that the region
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
as a whole is storing 54 years worth of
 
00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
the current annual greenhouse gas
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
emission from all sour our es that means
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
the transportation system factories
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
power plants Etc so our trees are
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
substantial in the Northeast region and
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
they store a tremendous amount of carbon
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
you can see the breakdown of the seven
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
states in the two graphs and you'll see
 
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
that in total Forest carbon storage New
 
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is in the lower area that's
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
simply because it's a smaller State
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
compared to the two big states in the
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
region Maine and New York but the bottom
 
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
one is more important that is the carbon
 
00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
storage per acre and you'll see New
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is right right in the thick of
 
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
it uh with the other states with
 
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts having the most carbon
 
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
stored in its Forest per acre of all
 
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
these seven
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
states and Mr chairman we talked earlier
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
but if anybody has any questions during
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
the presentation feel free to just
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
interrupt me and we can cover something
 
00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:18.519 align:start position:0%
then Forest carbon pools this is
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
important because when we get to markets
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
we need to know what these markets are
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
actually paying for and so um you'll
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
notice the pie charts on the left are
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
looking at storage and sequestration we
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
now know what those mean but the active
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
part of the various carbon pools that we
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
have meaning the actual live trees above
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
and below ground the litter the forest
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh the top of the soil the soil itself
 
00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:47.959 align:start position:0%
and dead wood material which in in any
 
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
Forest it's all over the place those are
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
the carbon pools but the active part
 
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
where stuff happens where the
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
sequestration happens is in the above
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
ground and below ground uh tree uh part
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
of it you'll see in the bottom uh pie
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
chart that the above ground live biomass
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
and the below ground live biomass where
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
the bulk of anything happens in terms of
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
sequestering taking carbon dioxide out
 
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:14.919 align:start position:0%
of the air but just know that the the
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
forest itself stores it in a bunch of
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
different places the other take home
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
from this slide very briefly is that uh
 
00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
when we look at Forest the soil itself
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
actually uh has about half of all the
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
carbon that's stored in a forest is
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
actually in the soil carbon markets do
 
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
not pay for that carbon markets are
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
really paying for the above and below
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
ground biomass uh in in the forest so
 
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
that's just something something to keep
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
in mind two two key Concepts on this in
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
the next graft and that is that in terms
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
of storage this first one this is this
 
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
graph is looking at a forest over 125
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
years Forest can live and grow a lot
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
longer than that um but that's what this
 
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
graph is showing and that it is simply
 
00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
showing that over time a forest that is
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
older has more carbon stored in it kind
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
of a no-brainer an older Forest probably
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
has bigger trees than a younger forest
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
and so uh it stores more carbon per area
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
Acre state county whatever we want to
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
talk about but the second concept that's
 
00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
really important is the concept of
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
sequestration because that first one is
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
storage this one is sequestration on the
 
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
second slide uh you'll notice that
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
younger Forest actually sequester more
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
carbon per area than older forest and
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's simply because they're growing
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
vigorously they have many more stems and
 
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately they have many more leaes uh
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
Lea leaves in the forest or needles and
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
that leaf surface or needle surface is
 
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
greater than in an older Forest where
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
you have some gaps right and so two
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
different concepts important to
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
understand and remember I mentioned that
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
a negative carbon flux is a good thing
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's what this gra graph is showing
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
when you see the graph dip down for soil
 
00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
Deadwood litter and live trees that's
 
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
because that's the part of the life
 
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:11.799 align:start position:0%
lifespan where the the forest is
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
sequestering the most carbon over the
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
life of the forest so it really uh is
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
showing it in a negative simply because
 
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
it's taking in more than it's giving off
 
00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.039 align:start position:0%
and the zero is is in the top part of
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
that uh that y
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
AIS and then lastly I just mentioned
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
before it's important to understand when
 
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
we Harvest Timber we're not necessarily
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
releasing all that carbon to the
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
atmosphere uh when we Harvest and that
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
wood goes into Long Live products uh
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
particularly solid wood products like a
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
lot of what these desks are made of in
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
this room uh that can that can be stored
 
00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:51.559 align:start position:0%
for a long time in buildings we all know
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
in New England we've got buildings that
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
were built in the late 1600s early 1700s
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
they're still standing they are timber
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
frame so that wood has been stored for
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years so it's very possible
 
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
in solid wood for that to happen so as
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
we think about the other products that
 
00:20:09.149 --> 00:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
are that are harvested um including
 
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
pulpwood which make goes into making
 
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
paper that's a short live product so it
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
lasts uh longer than if we burn it uh in
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
a wood stove but it doesn't last very
 
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
long it might last for 3 to seven years
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
whereas Long Live products like like the
 
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
the structure uh of all the wood in this
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
room can last for hundreds of years so
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
just something to keep in mind that we
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily release it all when we
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
cut trees we certainly release some of
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
it so we'll jump into the markets I
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
don't know if any questions about any of
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
that science or background but I thought
 
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
I'd start with that just to make sure
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you I just want to make
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
sure um in terms of my understanding
 
00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:48.039 align:start position:0%
about storage versus sequestration I
 
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:50.200 align:start position:0%
think of storage as the amount and
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
sequestration as the rate of change in
 
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
that amount that's correct good thank
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
you yeah thank you yes
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.830 align:start position:0%
you yeah thank you yes
sir

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
uh I I think there is such a thing as
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
soil decomposition as well which is
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
another flux right it's another carbon
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
di it doesn't the atmosphere so in the
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
soil uh there's a lot of carbon and it
 
00:21:12.909 --> 00:21:12.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily stay static it does
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
change but it's actually relatively
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
stable compared to to compared to what's
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
going on in the live tree uh components
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
of the forest but it certainly does
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
change in fact it adds carbon as trees
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
drop leaves and branches and so forth
 
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
eventually that that makes it it's way
 
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
into the at least some of it makes it
 
00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:32.919 align:start position:0%
makes its way into the soil and a lot of
 
00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
that material as it rots actually
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
releases uh the the the CO2 and
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes methane into the atmosphere
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
both greenhouse
 
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
gases okay yes
 
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
sir since um since the flux rate is the
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
is the highest when a forest is younger
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
does doesn't that
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
um doesn't that leave lead to the
 
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
conclusion that it makes sense to be
 
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
actively harvesting
 
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%
forests so because you're you're you're
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
you're taking the you're taking the wood
 
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
and you're hopefully putting it in
 
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
permanent places like homes and
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
Furniture right and then you're
 
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
replacing it with young plants that are
 
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:20.360 align:start position:0%
pulling a lot of carbon out of the
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
atmosphere it's a good observation it's
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
probably a little more complicated than
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
that uh in that what we don't want to do
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
is we don't want to take our older
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
forest and release all that carbon so
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
but even in a very high quality Forest
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
where you see a bunch of trees that that
 
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
that are this big and and they're
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
harvested out of that maybe 30% of that
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
volume will actually go into Long Live
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
products so it's not like you get 90%
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
because it's a high quality forest and
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
then in a lower quality Forest where you
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
got a bunch of deformed trees and we do
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
Forest improvements in that by removing
 
00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
the dead and dying uh disease trees
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
most of that doesn't go into long life
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
so some of that can be but we really
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to be necessarily converting
 
00:23:07.149 --> 00:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
older Forest to younger forest for that
 
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
purpose but when we have younger Forest
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
we certainly can increase the rate uh of
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
sequestration going on in those by doing
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
light thinnings of the disease and dying
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
trees so that the remaining trees are
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
healthy fast growing and we can get more
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
out of the forest that way so it's more
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
of an observation and you know when I
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
talk about young forests I'm talking
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
about forests that have average
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
diameters of trees like starting at this
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
to about like this no big big ones
 
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
generally so really small so 25 to 70
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
years is a forest that has trees in that
 
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.630 align:start position:0%
years is a forest that has trees in that
size

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
size
 
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.110 align:start position:0%
size
range

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
range
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um this is just a
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
clarification as well so then when when
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
we talk about sustainable forestry is is
 
00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.470 align:start position:0%
we talk about sustainable forestry is is
the

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:55.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
sustainability in terms of the
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
the age and health of the forest or is
 
00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:03.799 align:start position:0%
it sustainability in terms of the carbon
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
the net carbon uh footprint excellent
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
question um unfortunately there's no
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
Universal definition of sustainable
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
forestry so there are many different
 
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
takes on that so the most basic metric
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
out there that I use when I think about
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
sustainable forestry is how much is the
 
00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
forest growing in a time period annually
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
compared to how much we're harvesting
 
00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
right so New Hampshire we're blessed as
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
in all the states in this seven state
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
region in that annually we grow quite a
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
bit more forest volume meaning carbon
 
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
than we Harvest and that that gets lost
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
through land conversion to non-forest
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
use so we have about a 2:1 ratio in New
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right so for every year we're
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
growing twice the amount that we're
 
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
removing and that's a positive thing so
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
that's the most basic sustainability
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
metric that we want to start with there
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
are many more detailed definitions of
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
sustainability that are out there
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
because we have international uh
 
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
certification programs that actually
 
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
certify sustainability under a certain
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
definition on lands we have lands in New
 
00:25:13.389 --> 00:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are certified both to the
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
forest Stewardship Council and the
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
sustainable forestry initiative along
 
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
with Tree Farm which you probably are
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
aware of for smaller land owners those
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
are sustainability programs they measure
 
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
it they have standards and you meet
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
those so many different definitions but
 
00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
that basic one of of Timber or carbon
 
00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
sustainability is kind of where we
 
00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:35.799 align:start position:0%
should start in my mind yes sir yeah
 
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
overall I'm just interested in the how
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
much uh carbon dioxide is stored in New
 
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Forest as compared to how much
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
is emitted worldwide what percentage
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
would that be worldwide I I don't know
 
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
that I could find out for you but I
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
don't know that yeah I imagine small
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I do know that for New Hampshire we
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
we uh sequester uh an amount that is
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
about equal to almost 30% of the total
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
emissions from all sources in New
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire annually state of Maine
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
actually um you know these two states
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
have the highest percentage of Forest
 
00:26:15.549 --> 00:26:15.559 align:start position:0%
Area you've probably heard it in the
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
country state of main Forest actually
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
sequester an amount equal to about 70%
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
of the greenhouse gases that are
 
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
emission that are emitted in Maine
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
annually so these two states you know
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
the Forest play a pretty significant
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
role in offsetting uh the emissions that
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
are occurring yes
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
sir yes thank you for taking my question
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
does the rate of
 
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
sequestration change with the
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
atmospheric concentration of
 
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
CO2 in other words if CO2 levels are
 
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
increasing do the trees take in more
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
well the the science is pretty clear
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
that as we get higher CO2 levels the
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
trees have access to more CO2 which is
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
their one of their key inputs so they
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
have documented that some uh additional
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
growth is occurring because of that and
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
also because average temperatures are
 
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
increasing over time so in a place like
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I've been a Forester for
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
going on 45 years when I first started
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
we had probably two weeks less uh or
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
more of winter than we have today maybe
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
more right and that's additional grow
 
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
growing Seasons so the combination of
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
increased CO2 levels and longer growing
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
Seasons definitely is affecting our
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
forest a lot of other negative things
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
come along with that including evasive
 
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519 align:start position:0%
species and a bunch of other stuff the
 
00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
fact is yes our forests are growing a
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
bit more than they did as result I know
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
this committee has insatiable curiosity
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
about the subjects that we that come
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
before us but we do have some time
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
limits here we have a half hour left and
 
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of quite a few slides in the
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
presentation so I'd urge you to back off
 
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
on your questions just a little bit
 
00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
thank you okay I'm I'm going to jump
 
00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
into Force carbon offsets and obviously
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
if we have extra time at the end we can
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
come back to those other topics but you
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
probably know generally that when we're
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
talking about Force carbon offsets that
 
00:28:20.669 --> 00:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
is a subset of the term carbon offsets
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
so uh in terms of what's being bought
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
and sold there are offsets being bought
 
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
and sold that don't come from forest but
 
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
I will say that the vast majority of the
 
00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
carbon offsets being bought and sold
 
00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:34.519 align:start position:0%
here and elsewhere in the world are from
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
forest because they are the biggest
 
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
natural source of sequestration that
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
goes on and so the concept is simple uh
 
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
on the left side of of this image shows
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
a factory or a power plant emitting um
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide and if uh they've either
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
decided on their own to reduce those
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
emissions or uh state or federal law or
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
some other law in some other country
 
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
decides that they should be reducing
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
emissions uh they might have as an
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
option that they can reduce some
 
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
emissions at the stack but they can also
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
purchase offsets uh from a third party
 
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
to account for some of those emissions
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
and that's really what forc carbon
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
offsets are it's entities that are have
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh net emissions uh and in other words a
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
positive carbon flux over a time period
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
and they're purchasing offsets to offset
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
those emissions and in the forestry side
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
of things which is what what our focus
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
is today there are three kinds of um
 
00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:37.519 align:start position:0%
projects aforestation or reforestation
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
where you have no forest and you plant
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
trees remember in New Hampshire in the
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
Northeast we don't we don't really plant
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
trees to any great degree because we
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
don't have to we have a climate and
 
00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
ample uh rainfall so that uh we get
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
Forest Back naturally as you probably
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
know if you don't mow your lawn in your
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
backyard in 5 years you will have a
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
forest growing growing there I mean it's
 
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
just reality in this part of the world
 
00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
but um if you uh aforestation projects
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
under Forest carbon offsets are planting
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
trees we know you're not going to see
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire avoided conversion
 
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
is another category uh but it's not done
 
00:30:15.149 --> 00:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
very often the concept is there is this
 
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
property is imminently uh in track to be
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
developed to be changed from a forest to
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
a nonforest use whether that's
 
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
agriculture or developed use and you
 
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:27.559 align:start position:0%
stop that with the project we just don't
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
have many of those because they're very
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
complicated so where all the action is
 
00:30:33.509 --> 00:30:33.519 align:start position:0%
in Forest carbon offsets is that third
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
management when we when we read about
 
00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:45.799 align:start position:0%
the regional land trusts acquiring
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
tracts and saving a farm from potential
 
00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:52.039 align:start position:0%
development as a subdivision isn't that
 
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
category 2 it is yeah it's a it's a good
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh observation because that's really the
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
work that our land trust I know the for
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
society's in here and there probably
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
others uh who do that dayto day um they
 
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
are doing that with sources of money and
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
donations of easements and they just
 
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
haven't tried to crack this knot and I'm
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
actually talking with a few land trusts
 
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
who kind of want to crack that nut of
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
number two and it just hasn't been done
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
just because it's complicated because
 
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
you know you need to proves somehow that
 
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
that land was going to be developed not
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
you think it's going to be developed it
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
was it is going to be developed if we
 
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
don't do this and that's the hard part
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
of of verifying it right and it which is
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
not unlike for improved Forest
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
management which we'll talk about so
 
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
improved Forest management is is two
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
things it is changes in the management
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
on Forest land uh where sequestration
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
would be different over time than if you
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
didn't sign a contract uh for the sale
 
00:31:54.629 --> 00:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
of carbon offsets and that can be in two
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
forms one is actually Reserve where you
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
you set the land aside you don't Harvest
 
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
any timber at all when you had planned
 
00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
on it during the contract period and
 
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
then secondly especially in the larger
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
ownerships like Connecticut Lakes what
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about you can sell carbon
 
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh change your practices and also sell
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
Timber during the time period and I'll
 
00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:17.559 align:start position:0%
get into that a little bit uh later so
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
improved Forest management is where the
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
action is for Forest carbon offsets here
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
and and elsewhere in North America so
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
some key terminology here for the forest
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
carbon Market markets in this nested set
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
of Concepts and so the carbon project
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
itself that gray Circle down at at the
 
00:32:36.509 --> 00:32:36.519 align:start position:0%
bottom is a piece of forest on planet
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
Earth that we can identify you have to
 
00:32:40.269 --> 00:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
prove you own it like any real estate
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
deal because this is a long-term lease
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
on a piece of real estate but then
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's a carbon developer the carbon
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
developer in the case of of the project
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
on the Connecticut Lakes Pro property
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
the carbon developer at the time in 2003
 
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
when the previous owner sold the carbon
 
00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:58.519 align:start position:0%
was finite carbon still is because they
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
have a long-term relationship with
 
00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
whoever owns that land uh the carbon
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
developer job is actually to put
 
00:33:07.149 --> 00:33:07.159 align:start position:0%
together the project meaning the
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
contract terms to meet the requirements
 
00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
of the third nested Circle which is
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
carbon Registries and I've got some
 
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
slides that show these things so the
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
carbon Registries are actually private
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
entities except for the State of
 
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
California and we'll talk about that in
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
a second that set the rules for how you
 
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
develop a carbon credit which is one
 
00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
metric ton of carbon dioxide and you
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
know the Registries themselves outside
 
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
of California are generally unre
 
00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
regulated these are private entities
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
creating these rules and then lastly the
 
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
carbon markets themselves are virtual
 
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
markets where the buyers um will will uh
 
00:33:49.149 --> 00:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
essentially uh see what's available that
 
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
are that that's listed through the
 
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
carbon Registries and um have a deal of
 
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
some sort there's no set price it's a
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's a free market system so those are
 
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
the the various components of the actual
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
carbon markets and that goes for both
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
Forest carbon offsets and others as well
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
works that way yes Mr chairman is there
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
a carbon registry in New Hampshire no I
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
have a slide coming up that shows all
 
00:34:14.829 --> 00:34:14.839 align:start position:0%
the Registries and they are uh they are
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
Regional uh or national in nature so no
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
there's not one separately for New
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there's two kinds of carbon
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
projects uh or markets one is called the
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
compliance Market which is this slide
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
here and the time commitment in a
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
contract is 100 plus years so it's a
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
significant commitment that a landowner
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
needs to make in order to enter that
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
market today the only uh compliance
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
Market we have is as a result of
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
California's uh cap and trade program
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
for greenhouse gases that law passed I
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
don't know almost 20 years ago and so
 
00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
that program actually allowed for Forest
 
00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
carbon projects and other car carbon
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
projects outside of California although
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
much less so today than when they first
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
started doing this uh to to occur as an
 
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:08.599 align:start position:0%
offset in that marketplace where in
 
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
California the law creates uh
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
requirements of PowerPlant owners and
 
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
Factory owners in other words fixed
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
sources of greenhouse gases and so they
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
have to reduce those gases over time
 
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
just like uh we do with Reggie and and
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
other uh programs for a emissions and as
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
part of that reduction they can purchase
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
offsets not the whole thing but just
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
part of it and so that market uh is
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
actually the market that uh was entered
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
into in 2013 with Connecticut lakes with
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
the forest Land Group so
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
essentially uh the power plant owners
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
and Factory owners in California are
 
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
paying for the carbon on that
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes property in Northern
 
00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.589 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes property in Northern
New

00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that's a compliance market
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
now Washington state has has a brand new
 
00:35:59.950 --> 00:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
law mired after California but they've
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
decided that only projects within
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
Washington state will be allowed so we
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
won't have access to that and so for the
 
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
time being uh the only place where this
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
can happen is through the California
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
resources board Market but again they've
 
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
they're discouraging Pro projects
 
00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
outside of California as we go on Oregon
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
is probably going to be passing a law
 
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
and this group you all know what Reggie
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
is Reggie actually has a language that
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh would allow for offsets but the rules
 
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
are so convoluted that nobody has put
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
together a forest carbon project under
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
Reggie rules and probably won't unless
 
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
the rules are are changed so that's been
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
there since the beginning of Reggie it
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
just doesn't work so uh as I said uh the
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
compliance Market is where Connecticut
 
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.510 align:start position:0%
compliance Market is where Connecticut
Lakes

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
Lakes
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
is the uh the voluntary Market it seems
 
00:36:52.309 --> 00:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
like the the slide I had for that didn't
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
show up here anyways the voluntary
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
Market is the second Marketplace
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
and the voluntary Market has no
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
government regulation or oversight on it
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
as of today and what is the voluntary
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
Market the voluntary Market is any
 
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
entity but mostly when I think about it
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
I think about large emitting entities
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
think about American Airlines and
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
Microsoft and Amazon and and those
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
categories and Banks uh big companies
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
that want to reduce their uh
 
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
emissions and hopefully they are
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
reducing some their actual emissions but
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
the voluntary carbon Market does not
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
require them to do anything they make it
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
made a voluntary choice to do so and
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
under those markets they can purchase
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
offsets and they they have been
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
purchasing Forest carbon offsets uh
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
quite a bit uh since that really got
 
00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:46.839 align:start position:0%
going uh 15 years ago or so and under
 
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
those under that Pro program again the
 
00:37:53.069 --> 00:37:53.079 align:start position:0%
registry set the rules but there is no U
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
there are no government oversight on
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
that and on on that there's a 40-year uh
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
commitment in the volunteer carbon
 
00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
Market except for one small program for
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
small land owners which I'll talk about
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
in a second and that's a 20-year
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
commitment so generally it's a 40-year
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
commitment in the voluntary Market again
 
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
nobody's requiring anybody to do any of
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
that yet a lot of money is changing
 
00:38:17.069 --> 00:38:17.079 align:start position:0%
hands and this slide has the money in
 
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
that uh the voluntary Market the last
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
full year we have data from about $2.5
 
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
billion dollar uh was spent on offsets
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh in the California air resources board
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
compliance Market was about 3.7 billion
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
these numbers are going up over time and
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
where the action is is in the voluntary
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
carbon Marketplace these are entities
 
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
again that don't have to do it but have
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
chosen uh to do it uh although the
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
property that brought on the bill that
 
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
you have before you is in that
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
compliance market so here are the carbon
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
Registries so the carbon Registries that
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking about for California is
 
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
ARB on the left side I meant I put
 
00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:56.839 align:start position:0%
Reggie here because technically under
 
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
under the laws that you all passed in
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
the Reggie states there there is an
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity but it doesn't work so the
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
the Registries were really talking about
 
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
our climate AC action Reserve American
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
carbon registry and Vera so again these
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
are the entities that make the rules
 
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
that say what does it take to create a
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
legitimate carbon credit under their
 
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
program that could be sold uh these are
 
00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:21.079 align:start position:0%
these entities that you know have been
 
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
around uh for decade plus now that
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
really set those rules so remember in
 
00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
the Centric circles yes
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
sir thank you for taking my question can
 
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:32.839 align:start position:0%
I can I go back to the difference
 
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
between the voluntary and the compliance
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
Market yes I'm trying to get clear in my
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
head the difference between an offset
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
and a credit do the do those
 
00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
play together with voluntary and
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
compliance Market yeah they are the same
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
when we say an offset uh it's the same
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
as a credit and we T we talk in terms of
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
metric tons of carbon Dix so we actually
 
00:39:58.309 --> 00:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
talk in terms of metric tons of carbon
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
dioxide equivalent right so if you take
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
carbon uh in order to get to carbon
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
dioxide carbon is one atom no I'm not
 
00:40:10.589 --> 00:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not a chemist but carbon is one atom
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide is one carbon atom and
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
two oxygen atoms right so that that
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
molecule is actually 3.67 times heavier
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
than a single carbon atom right so we
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
actually have to to think about that as
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
we do it but it's metric tons tons of
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
carb carbon dioxide equivalent that that
 
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
carbon times 3.67 that we're talking
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
about that gives one credit or or one
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
offset same term good question sorry I
 
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear on that so the carbon
 
00:40:40.349 --> 00:40:40.359 align:start position:0%
developers remember these are the
 
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
entities that help you as a land owner
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
meet the rules of those Registries these
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are generally
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
operating uh in the US there are a few
 
00:40:51.069 --> 00:40:51.079 align:start position:0%
others they haven't done much I
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned finite carbon which is in the
 
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
left box we're we're large land owners
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh work with these these kinds of carbon
 
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
developers planed carbon worked with the
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
forest Land Group on the Connecticut
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
Lakes property back in 2012 to 20 the
 
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
end of 2013 to put together that project
 
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
uh the ones on the right side are uh set
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
up specifically to work with small land
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
owners and now so what do I mean by
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
small the ones on the left side you need
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
really 5,000 Acres or more and generally
 
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
probably more like 10,000 acres I mean
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
they have done some projects with 5,000
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
Acres but anything smaller than that
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
they're saying is small right so the
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
ones on the right side are the ones that
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
can work with small land owners even
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
down to 30 or 40 acres uh but the the
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
the carbon developers on the left have
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
been around for almost 20 years the
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
carbon developers on the right have only
 
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
been around for two or three years this
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
is brand new for small land owners I
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
have one crossed out there simply
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
because that one was there two years ago
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
it had a unique program that uh had a a
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
one-year contract people flocked to it
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
it started in the Deep South in the US
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
people flocked to it and then when they
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
tried to get their methodology approved
 
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
by one of the Registries right that set
 
00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
the rules regist registry said M can't
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
do it does doesn't really create any any
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
additional carbon right and so that one
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
really went by the wayside so the two
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
that are available in New Hampshire
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
right now are Forest carbon works and
 
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
the family forest carbon program core
 
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
carbon supposed to be here by the end of
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
the year but those are the for the
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
smaller land owners Forest carbon works
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
in the traditional way in that they buy
 
00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:32.839 align:start position:0%
the carbon off your property family
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
forest carbon program which is a joint
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
program of the American Forest
 
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
Foundation which is the tree farm
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
nonprofit that you're probably aware of
 
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
and The Nature Conservancy which you
 
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
probably are also aware of they actually
 
00:42:47.069 --> 00:42:47.079 align:start position:0%
pay for practices they don't pay for
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
actual carbon they pay for you to do
 
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
something either not Harvest Timber or
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
reduce harvesting Timber as a way and
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
then they own your carbon and sell your
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
carbon in the market place yes sir
 
00:42:59.950 --> 00:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
Charlie I just want to remind you that
 
00:43:02.549 --> 00:43:02.559 align:start position:0%
because this is a presentation for
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
information purposes we have a hard stop
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock you bet yeah we'll get
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
through it I don't have too many more
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
slides I'm going to be going through
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
them pretty quickly so again the
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
Registries themselves are really set up
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
Ru setting up rules to do these five
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
things making sure that the carbon
 
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
project itself and and you change your
 
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:22.839 align:start position:0%
mind and want out of the program they
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
have stiff penalties not that you can't
 
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
get out of it but you're not going to
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
want to because the penalties are huge
 
00:43:29.309 --> 00:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to pay back what
 
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
you got paid plus a lot more as a result
 
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
of that and then there's this issue of
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
leakage which I only will leave with you
 
00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:38.559 align:start position:0%
which is the thing of all of this and
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
I've been working on this for years now
 
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
that kind of keeps me up at night and
 
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
that is that leakage in the timber World
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
goes like this planet wide I don't have
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
the slide in here but Planet wide we
 
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
have um data that shows very clearly
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
that over time we as humans are using
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh Timber at an increasing rate and that
 
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
occurs also if we break it down to the
 
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
United States so over time we're using
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
more and more wood so if we in fact in
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or anywhere reduce the
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
amount of wood that's being harvested
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to get harvested somewhere
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
else maybe somewhere else in New
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire maybe somewhere else in South
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
America but that's the T the issue of
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
leakage and whether or not you know an
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
actual carbon credit and offset credit
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
is it real if you're just pushing the
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
demand for wood uh somewhere else that's
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
the thing that kind of blows my mind and
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure how that all turns
 
00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
out the the programs and the Registries
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
themselves try to take that into account
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
so when you sell offsets you actually
 
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
put sell a block of them and actually
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
they're put into a buffer pool that you
 
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
don't get paid for and that that
 
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
accounts for when you have big forest
 
00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:48.559 align:start position:0%
fires like out west uh or some other
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
natural disaster on your property but
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
leakage is a big deal issue so this
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
slide is just the the fact that and you
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
probably all know this this this whole
 
00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
concept of these offsets is fairly
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
controversial and this is just a listing
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
of a bunch of press reports over the
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
last number of years where people are
 
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
really questioning the validity of the
 
00:45:09.549 --> 00:45:09.559 align:start position:0%
these whole markets so quickly to go
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
through uh just to show you how this has
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
grown uh in North America in 2000 we
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
really had nothing in in the US and and
 
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
in Canada there was one project in
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
Mexico was kind of an early uh pilot
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
project 2005 and
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
2020 so you know it has grown over time
 
00:45:29.069 --> 00:45:29.079 align:start position:0%
but more importantly what's going on in
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it actually hasn't grown
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
very very uh fast in New Hampshire in
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh which uh has uh just
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
under 5 million Acres of forest land we
 
00:45:44.109 --> 00:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
only have just under 200,000 Acres that
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
are under long-term Forest carbon
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
contracts for offsets that's you know
 
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
just over 3 and a half% of the New
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Forest land more importantly
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
what kind of growth are we having and
 
00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:56.559 align:start position:0%
the second graph
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
shows that since 2013 when the
 
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes project happened we've
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
had very little growth so the the blue
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
graph on the right side of this graph is
 
00:46:10.349 --> 00:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
2013 and 20 today 2024 is the next one
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
you don't see a whole lot of change
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
because we we've gone from about
 
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
155,000 acres in 2013 to just under
 
00:46:20.349 --> 00:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
200,000 in that whole time period in a
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
10year period right so we don't have a
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
growth that's going off the charts
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it won't have happen but
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's not happening and and I'd say that
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's not happening simply because of the
 
00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
price of carbon in the marketplace is
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
not enough to entice a lot of people to
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
do it uh because it's not bad but it's
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
not great and that's why we probably
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
won't have tremendous growth but it just
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
happens that we've got one big project
 
00:46:44.549 --> 00:46:44.559 align:start position:0%
under a carbon project and that's
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes so getting back to
 
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
Connecticut lakes with the last few
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
slides here so we've gone back uh
 
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
through and these data come from um
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
division of forest and lands
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh and from the previous the original
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
owner lime Timber that shows the Harvest
 
00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:04.559 align:start position:0%
levels on the Connecticut Lakes property
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
starting in 2003 when lime Timber uh was
 
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
the first owner of that 146,00 acres and
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
you can see it fluctuates over time uh
 
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
at the end of this graph in 2024 is what
 
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh the current owner Aurora sustainable
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
Forest LLC is proposing uh for Harvest
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
level as time goes on uh more
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
importantly uh to put in perspective the
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
second slide shows that before the
 
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
carbon project which again happened
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
under the previous owner the forest Land
 
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
Group before that in
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
2013 uh so from 20 2003 to two
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
2013 the average annual Harvest on that
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
146,000 acres and change was 40,000
 
00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
cords a year I'm using cords because I
 
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
think we understand that unit reasonably
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
well 4 feet by 4 feet by 8T a block of
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
wood right that's aord and so that was
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
before the carbon project after the
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
carbon project including that time
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
period that the forest Land Group owned
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
it you can see the red bar that shows
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
that the Harvest level level did get
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
reduced by about 25% to 30,000 cords uh
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
for that time period up until uh when
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
now Aurora purchased the land uh in late
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
2022 so you can see the changes over
 
00:48:23.549 --> 00:48:23.559 align:start position:0%
time and the proposed uh Harvest levels
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
that Aurora has uh put forward and that
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
is why we're here because of what
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
they're proposing because as I mentioned
 
00:48:33.309 --> 00:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
under both compliance and the the
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
voluntary Market you can Harvest Timber
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
and sell
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
carbon and here's how you do that so in
 
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
this graph here which is somewhat
 
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
theoretical uh think of the green part
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
of this graph being the standing timber
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
in 2013 on the Connecticut Lakes
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
property right so at the time they
 
00:48:55.549 --> 00:48:55.559 align:start position:0%
actually went out set up permanent PL
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
spot where they measured trees and they
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
get measured over time at that time
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
there was a certain amount of carbon or
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
Timber standing on that property and at
 
00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:06.799 align:start position:0%
the time they actually got paid for that
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
standing carbon uh on that property the
 
00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
company back there this is public
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
information because this is uh through
 
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
the California program they got paid
 
00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
over $30 million for that third that
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
standing carbon in the trees on that
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
property in
 
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
2013 that contract that they signed
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
requires them for over 100 years to
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
maintain at least that level of green
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
right at least that amount but for USS
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
grow and that uh other color kind of uh
 
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
off orange on my screen here is what
 
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:41.799 align:start position:0%
grows annually and so in a carbon
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
project over time you can get paid for a
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
block sum up front that you've got to
 
00:49:48.349 --> 00:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
maintain for the life of the contract
 
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
right because you're storing that carbon
 
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
but you can also get paid for the annual
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
net growth or at least a part of that
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
because remember I talked about a buffer
 
00:49:59.230 --> 00:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
pool so what's gone on since 2013 is
 
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
that the previous owner and the current
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
owners are selling carbon out of that
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
annual net growth right so annual net
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
growth means gross growth less the
 
00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
mortality because trees die naturally
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
right so out of that these these
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
contracts allow you to sell a portion of
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
that carbon or cut all that Timber or
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
sell some carbon and cut timber Aurora
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
and the previous owner are going to cut
 
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
some Timber and uh sell some carbon um
 
00:50:28.109 --> 00:50:28.119 align:start position:0%
but Aurora is simply choosing to sell
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
more carbon than the previous owner
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
compared to how much Timber they're
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
Harvest so that's really how it works
 
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.109 --> 00:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
represent please use your mic please use
 
00:50:40.119 --> 00:50:41.390 align:start position:0%
represent please use your mic please use
your

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:44.839 align:start position:0%
mic sorry when you say sell carbon you
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
mean sell more storage get paid to store
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
to keep more in storage really get paid
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
to sequester more that turns into stored
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
carbon correct right so out of that
 
00:50:59.309 --> 00:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
annual amount they're able to do that
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
right but they've got to maintain a
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
minimum of that green for the life of
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
the 100-year contract uh but they can
 
00:51:08.109 --> 00:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
choose over time to sell carbon sell
 
00:51:10.349 --> 00:51:10.359 align:start position:0%
Timber or a combination of the bo of
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
both of those over time because every
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
year you've got a graph that looks like
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
this so that's really how how these
 
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
programs uh work and that's all I have
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
so hopefully we got time for questions
 
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman so the 30 million you
 
00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:26.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the previous slide that
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
applied to the green section of the
 
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
graph standing carbon temper did that
 
00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:35.559 align:start position:0%
$30 million all go out of
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
state well since the forest Land Group
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh is not dyed nor is Aurora domiciled
 
00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the answer is yes y
 
00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:47.559 align:start position:0%
that th those carbon revenues do not go
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
in state they go out of state to
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
wherever the the owner of the land
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
resides great thank you representative
 
00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you um I
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
think I know the answer to this but um
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
do fruit trees uh take in more CO2 and
 
00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:04.839 align:start position:0%
is there benefit to to planting more
 
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
fruit trees if so I mean compared to
 
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
forest trees yes I I don't really know
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
the answer to that it really comes down
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
to the leaf surface you know where the
 
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
photosynthesis happens so if a fruit
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
fruit tree has more Leaf surface
 
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
compared to a forest grown tree the
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
answer would be yes but obviously fruit
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
trees and forest trees are all varied we
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
get little ones we get big ones and so
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
really would depend on what you compare
 
00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:27.910 align:start position:0%
really would depend on what you compare
it

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
to representative muns has a question
 
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um this this green level of
 
00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
standing carbon um was that level in
 
00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
effect when the uh in your in your
 
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
previous slide when the um car you know
 
00:52:48.829 --> 00:52:48.839 align:start position:0%
the average after carbon project kicked
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:56.829 --> 00:52:56.839 align:start position:0%
203 when that when that at the beginning
 
00:52:59.789 --> 00:52:59.799 align:start position:0%
of that red line yeah was there a
 
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
requirement for the to have the green
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
amount of standing Timber be present yes
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
for for the next hundred years starting
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
with that red line starts and remember
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
this graph is not showing that stuff
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
right this is showing amount of harvest
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
over these years no so my my question is
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
so that that level has been in effect
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
for quite a while there was quite a bit
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
of harvesting happening prior to 2023 so
 
00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:30.990 align:start position:0%
of harvesting happening prior to 2023 so
what

00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
changed why why is there less harves
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
harvesting yeah so that's a decision
 
00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
remember I mentioned the project at the
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
beginning was
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
171,00 Acres previously owned by
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
International Paper paper previously
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
owned by Champion International before
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
that that land got split into kind of
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
two blocks 25,000 acres plus 100 acres
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
to the state of New Hampshire the
 
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
private land owner has owned 4 6,400
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
Acres since then and the decision about
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
the Harvest levels on that
 
00:54:05.069 --> 00:54:05.079 align:start position:0%
146,00 uh acres is really that of of the
 
00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
private land owner which is now aoro
 
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
sustainable lands I will tell you
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
something this is a little bit of
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
editorializing but I also wore a hat
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
back then I did Consulting work for the
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
trust Republic land for about two years
 
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
I did nothing but try to put this
 
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
project together and I know that when
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
the conservation easement was drafted an
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
Edwards from uh then the Department of
 
00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
Justice was the lead for the State of
 
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire when that easement was
 
00:54:35.309 --> 00:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
developed uh the intent was that that
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
private land had one economic well two
 
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
economic uses but one major economic use
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
over time forever into the future and
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
that was to grow and and provide Timber
 
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
to the forest products industry that was
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
the intent of the easement in 2002 when
 
00:54:53.549 --> 00:54:53.559 align:start position:0%
that was all negotiated nobody knew
 
00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
about carbon uh project projects or
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
markets they didn't exist so that
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
easement was silent on that and that's
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
why we're we're at where we are now
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
because the eement says nothing about
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
whether you can do that or not at least
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
in a general sense and so it's the
 
00:55:11.309 --> 00:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
private land owner's decision to reduce
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
Harvest and sell more of the carbon in
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
that annual uh growth that occurs that's
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
decision representative parshall has a
 
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
question chair of house um and thank you
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today very
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
enlightening um you were um saying a few
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
things about your concern about leakage
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
into other markets are these other
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
markets uh first I assume we're talk
 
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
about markets in Africa and South
 
00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
America and the like are these markets
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
as well regulated as our domestic
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
markets as far as uh ascertaining that
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
they are producing what they're
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
allegedly producing right so in terms of
 
00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
leakage of course if you don't harvest
 
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
in your property it's Poss possible the
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
property next door in New Hampshire
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
would get harvested right but could mean
 
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
that it's in Africa or some other places
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
where it's not nearly as regulated as it
 
00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:06.200 align:start position:0%
is in in the United States we we have
 
00:56:09.309 --> 00:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
laws in place to protect our forests uh
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
and you know other places in the world
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have laws that are
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
strict maybe not in the EU but in other
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
places in Africa South America and and
 
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:20.440 align:start position:0%
uh Asia certainly don't have the kind of
 
00:56:22.829 --> 00:56:22.839 align:start position:0%
regul regulations we have so yeah that's
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
a that's a good concern I have that
 
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
concern as well
 
00:56:28.349 --> 00:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
well okay I'm going to use my Chairman's
 
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
prerogative here since we only have five
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
minutes left and ask one final question
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
and that is when all of these programs
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
were developed was any thought given to
 
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
how they might affect the existing
 
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
Timber industry in in New Hampshire and
 
00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
was there any kind of
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
mitigation for possible damage to the
 
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
timber timber industry figured into the
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
design of these programs I'd say
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
generally the answer is no uh I will say
 
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
that today there's much more thought
 
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
going into that because they're seeing
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
some effects you know prior to the
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes project we really
 
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have any lightning rod projects
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
around carbon that people were concerned
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
about because it was affecting the
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
forest products industry but the fact is
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
that it's based on the landowner
 
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
decision from 2013 to 2022 when the
 
00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
current landowner bought this land most
 
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
people didn't know that there was a
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
carbon project on the Connecticut Lakes
 
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
property cuz they reduce Harvest levels
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
slightly but not in in the way that this
 
00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:37.799 align:start position:0%
current owner is proposing to do so you
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
know we didn't really see that and this
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
project uh in the whole Northeast where
 
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
we focus our attention uh is really the
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
lightning rod one where it's truly
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
affecting what's going on in the forest
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
products industry we know now that in
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
fact it is affecting markets so back
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
when they created this remember this
 
00:57:58.270 --> 00:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
stuff came really out of uh you know the
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
Earth Summit uh Way Way Back in Rio Rio
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
de Janeiro and whatever
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
1994 um and the cop meetings you know
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
this is coming out of worldwide
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
discussions around climate change and so
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh the concern uh comes down to the fact
 
00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
that forests are the the most important
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
natural solution we have and so uh I'd
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
say that not a lot of thought went into
 
00:58:24.029 --> 00:58:24.039 align:start position:0%
it when they started and created the
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
programs and more thoughts going into it
 
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
now because we're seeing the true
 
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
effects of it so it's a good question
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you and it's a great segue into
 
00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
the public hearing that we will resume
 
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:37.160 align:start position:0%

well

01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%

okay everyone please take your seats we
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
will now open a suspended public hearing
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.750 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
1697

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
1697
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
FN a bill relative to suspending New
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's participation in emissions
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
reduction credit programs for a period
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
of two years we know that the original
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
bill under that title was a
 
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding and a
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
mistake and that what we're really
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
talking about here is for Forest carbon
 
01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
credits and its effect on New
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we're going to start this
 
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
morning I do have the pink cards from
 
01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
the last public hearing and we will go
 
01:05:38.039 --> 01:05:40.630 align:start position:0%
the last public hearing and we will go
through

01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
them as we proceed plus I've received a
 
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
few new ones this
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
morning and we have two full hours for
 
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
this resumed public hearing so we should
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
be able to allow everybody to speak this
 
01:05:53.599 --> 01:05:55.190 align:start position:0%
be able to allow everybody to speak this
morning

01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:05:57.549 --> 01:05:57.559 align:start position:0%
nevertheless I would like to remind each
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
person who does speak to be as brief and
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
as Su succinct as possible preferably
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
keep your remarks to three minutes or
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
less and if you hear somebody say
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
something that's on the record you don't
 
01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
have to repeat it when it's your turn to
 
01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
speak what we're interested in would be
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
new and fresh
 
01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:25.480 align:start position:0%
information rather than repetition of
 
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:29.109 align:start position:0%
information rather than repetition of
existing

01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
information so is uh representative Jim
 
01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.269 align:start position:0%
information so is uh representative Jim
Tierney

01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
Tierney
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
here if so Jim will uh will be the first
 
01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:39.640 align:start position:0%

01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:43.640 align:start position:0%
with representative Eman Kelly if he is
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%

01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
yours thank you Mr chairman and members
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee you have heard how the
 
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
sale of these carbon credits uh affects
 
01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:13.480 align:start position:0%
the recreational activities and later on
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
you will hear how it will affect how it
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
affects Coos County and the
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the logging industry
 
01:07:22.109 --> 01:07:22.119 align:start position:0%
right now there is no State regulation
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
of this activity new Hampshire is not
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
getting any benefit from this business
 
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
there is no sales tax are they paying
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax the business
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
headquarters is not here and what they
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
are basically selling are stocks
 
01:07:37.039 --> 01:07:38.390 align:start position:0%
are basically selling are stocks
Commodities

01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
Commodities
 
01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
transactions and with no income tax we
 
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
get nothing there either let me make one
 
01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
point clear however I am not advocating
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
for either of those
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
taxes the market for these transactions
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
are handled in California where carb the
 
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
California air resources board is
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
directing that the leases on these lands
 
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
are to be for 100 years in order to
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
participate in their
 
01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:04.839 align:start position:0%
Market let's go back to
 
01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
1924 World War I is a few years in the
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
past next to come is the Great
 
01:08:14.349 --> 01:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
Depression World War II will start in 39
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
and we are in it in 41 four years later
 
01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
it's over then comes the Korean war in
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
the early ' 50s in the 60s it's War in
 
01:08:27.309 --> 01:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
Vietnam and Men on the moon more war in
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
the Middle East 911 and war in
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan all this in 100
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
years how can we lock up our forests for
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
100 years when we don't know what is
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
going to happen also I don't know about
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
you but as for me I am not in favor of
 
01:08:50.189 --> 01:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
California telling New Hampshire when we
 
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
can use our forest lands
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
again new Hampshire needs this 2-year
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
moratorium to figure out what will be in
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the state and its
 
01:09:02.829 --> 01:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
citizens and if a plan is conceived
 
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
sooner than the two years then the
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
moratorium can end sooner thank you
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative appreciate you
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
being here to elucid elucidate us on the
 
01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
issues that you're trying to deal with
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
in this legislation I do have one
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
question that you said in your testimony
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
just a few minutes ago that Aurora
 
01:09:30.669 --> 01:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
sustainable lands which is the company
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
that's doing all this carbon sequest
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
sequestration does not pay New Hampshire
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
business uh profits taxes or uh B
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
business taxes I didn't say they don't I
 
01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
said uh are they paying the business tax
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
don't know okay well maybe you weren't
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
here when they were here at the original
 
01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
version of this public hearing they said
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
they do pay those taxes they believe I
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
was here at that original hearing and I
 
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
believe they said they pay all taxes
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't specify any particular one
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
and they didn't specify any amounts or
 
01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
what taxes they were
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
paying okay well we can get
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
clarification on that appreciate that
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
other questions for the
 
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative representative liwicki
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
has a question uh thank you Mr chairman
 
01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and I'm
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
not sure whether you're the appropriate
 
01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
person to answer but I'm curious as to
 
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
how this uh goes with current use and if
 
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
these lands are being removed from
 
01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
agricultural forestry use would they
 
01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
then be uh deemed to be moving out of
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
the current use well the way I
 
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
understand the current use there are
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
different levels of it uh depending upon
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
what you're doing if you're allowing
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
Recreation that gets you a lower one if
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
you allow hunting uh uh stuff like that
 
01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
the uh ohvs snowmobilers you get a lower
 
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
rate if you're allowing everything you
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
get the lowest rate possible if you
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
allow nothing your uh current use rate
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
is a higher tax than if you allow uh
 
01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
different things on there um right now
 
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
we know there's the easement on um the
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
property up at the Connecticut
 
01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
headquarters we don't know if there are
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
easements on any other of the oim at 5
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
million Acres of forest lands here in
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and if there are no
 
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
easements on them somebody can come in
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
and say okay fine any of the uh
 
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
snowmobile trails through there they're
 
01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
now closed any of the H ohrv trails that
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
are through there they're now closed you
 
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
can't hunt here you can't fish here on
 
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
any of the uh rivers and lakes that run
 
01:11:48.629 --> 01:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
through our property it's all done we're
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
caret okay further questions
 
01:11:56.669 --> 01:11:56.679 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has one thank
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
so it seems if I got this straight you
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
want to pass a bill that would tell
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
private land owners who enter into a
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
legal contract with somebody else that
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
they cannot abide by that contract
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
because you don't like the idea uh it's
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
their property it's private property
 
01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:14.679 align:start position:0%
where else do you draw the line you
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
going to start telling people what they
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
can do with their property everywhere or
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
is it just Coos County is going to be
 
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
controlled by the state what we're
 
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
looking for on this bill is uh time to
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
figure out what the state wants to do
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
time to figure out how you want to
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
regulate private property no trying to
 
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
figure out how we want to Reg
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me representative
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
Harrington this is not a debate we we're
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
just asking questions representative tyy
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh what we're trying to figure
 
01:12:48.629 --> 01:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
figure out here is how to regulate the
 
01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
business so that right now uh the
 
01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
profits appear to be going to a out of
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
state why can't they go uh not
 
01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily to a market in here but make
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
sure we're getting the taxes there is no
 
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
registry right now for what's going
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
on uh the current use where uh folks
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
that put their property in current use
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
that is a registry uh through uh I
 
01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
believe dr's got it uh but there's
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
nothing for the uh carbon credits who's
 
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
put their property in who's not we're
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
not looking to stop anybody who's
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
currently selling we just want to put a
 
01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
moratorium on any new selling until we
 
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
figure out what the heck uh the state
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
needs to do to regulate it and like I
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
said I'm not in favor of California
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
being the regulatory
 
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
power okay thank
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Kaplan has a question
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:13:53.709 --> 01:13:53.719 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned that the idea is to
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
stop any new uh trading on the carbon
 
01:13:59.070 --> 01:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
markets but as far as I read the bill it
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that it says suspend all
 
01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
current uh trading so can you CL clarify
 
01:14:08.189 --> 01:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
that I I do know in talking with the
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
other folks that have put this bill in
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
that new new ones is what we're looking
 
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
to stop anybody who's currently doing it
 
01:14:19.709 --> 01:14:19.719 align:start position:0%
and like I said there's no registry so
 
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
other than the Connecticut headquarters
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
we don't know of anybody else doing it
 
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
if they've got contracts set up fine
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
keep your contracts going but it's any
 
01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
new ones from here forward that we would
 
01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
like to just put a hold on for two years
 
01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
or less figure out what we want to do uh
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
up representative Ms has a question
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question as
 
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
a followup to representative kaplan's
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
question and your answer um so if there
 
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
was any new regulations that were put in
 
01:15:01.629 --> 01:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
place as a result of this two-year study
 
01:15:05.229 --> 01:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
that you're proposing would would you
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
expect those regulations to be
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
retroactive and apply to existing
 
01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.149 align:start position:0%
retroactive and apply to existing
contracts

01:15:13.149 --> 01:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
01:15:13.159 --> 01:15:14.870 align:start position:0%
contracts
no

01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:16.629 align:start position:0%
no
followup

01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
followup
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
followup so if that's if if that's your
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
answer does that then suggests that
 
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
nothing that we would do as a state
 
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
Aurora best answer to that is more than
 
01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
likely yes
 
01:15:38.189 --> 01:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
for the immediate time frame in other
 
01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
words if they've got a contract already
 
01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:43.719 align:start position:0%
in place uh through carb for that with a
 
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
100-year uh hold on uh the property in
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
other words that's what's going to be
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
done for the carbon if New Hampshire
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
then for example put in that okay okay
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
we don't like leases of 100 years we
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
would prefer a lease say of 20 years
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay it wouldn't uh they could still
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
keep their 100-year lease they just
 
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't renew their 100-year lease they
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
would have to follow the New Hampshire
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
rules when that lease was up of 20 years
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
in okay thank you representative for
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%

Forest economy here in New Hampshire and
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
why I'm supporting HP
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
1697 from 1990 to 2010 New Hampshire
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
went through the largest economic shift
 
01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
in its history the collapse of the Pulp
 
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
and Paper industry caused the loss of
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
nearly 50% of direct jobs in the forest
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
products industry Forest Products fell
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
from over 12% of State GDP down to less
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
than 4% during that time no count County
 
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
felt that those losses greater than Coos
 
01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
the impact of this Market shift went
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
beyond broad jaw numbers the loss of
 
01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
Pulp and Paper plants meant loggers no
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
longer had a buyer for lowgrade wood
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
that represents the majority of New
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire forests the dismantling of the
 
01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
large plots of forest land accumulated
 
01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
by Pulp and Paper companies led to a
 
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
system where work was much less reliable
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
for the logging
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
industry where before loggers could rely
 
01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
on a single customer for yearly
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
contracts they now had to Cobble
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
together work from a number of smaller
 
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
sources these new selective cutting
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
practices and less reliable harvesting
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
have led to an increase in the cost of
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
Saw logs New Hampshire's remaining
 
01:17:56.189 --> 01:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
Forest Products manufacturers have
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
adapted to this new climate employment
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
in the sector has remained relatively
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
consistent for the last decade an
 
01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
exploding market for carbon credits risk
 
01:18:06.629 --> 01:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
putting the forest products industry
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
through another economic catastrophe
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
carbon credits generated by New
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Forest have have been sold on
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
foreign exchanges for over a decade
 
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
their only recent notoriety shows that
 
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
they can exist alongside the Legacy
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
Forest products industry in fact I'm
 
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
very interested in how these credits
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
could be used for the creation and
 
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
growth of community forests I'm here in
 
01:18:28.629 --> 01:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
support of this legislation because we
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
as a state need to understand how to
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
keep that balance the division of forest
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
and lands could come up here and tell
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
you endless statistics about Legacy
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
Timber industry they could tell you how
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
many acres were cut last year where
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
those cuts happened what species were
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
harvested where those logs ended up and
 
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
how all those numbers compare to
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
previous years at the same time the
 
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
division cannot tell you something as
 
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
simple as how many carbon credits were
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
sold from New Hampshire Forest land last
 
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
year while we may have some insight
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
through sales and public markets there's
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
a much larger voluntary Market where
 
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
there is little to no Clarity with
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
contract terms over 100 years and a new
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
push for federal government from the
 
01:19:05.629 --> 01:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
federal government to expand these
 
01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
programs to smaller and smaller Parcels
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
there is tremendous uncertainty about
 
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
the future availability of timber here
 
01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire resource availability
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
is the number one factor in Sawmill
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
investment we are only one year removed
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
from the best year of for domestic
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
Sawmills in decades yet last summer my
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
own New Hampshire's largest Sawmill and
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
one of the largest employers in coas
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
County had to shut down for nearly a
 
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
month due to a lack of available Timber
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
directly caused by the sale of carbon
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
credits I would ask for your support to
 
01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation so that we can take
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
this time to properly study this issue
 
01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:39.560 align:start position:0%
and hopefully chart a course that avoids
 
01:19:41.229 --> 01:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
the second collapse of forest products
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
industry here in New Hampshire um I also
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
mention um as uh Mr LEC um alluded to
 
01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
there are two other bills uh in front of
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
two other committees um both those bills
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
I sponsored
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
um they are attempts at a a long-term
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
solution um but I think it's important
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
to to realize that that both of those
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
are going to take some time um the
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
previous Timber tax um when it was
 
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
established took four years um to
 
01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
establish and it's passed by a single
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
vote uh in front of the house so that
 
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
was a 1949 we haven't examined this
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
issue um in in depth for a long time um
 
01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
so I think that getting the the
 
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge the understanding and the
 
01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
complexity um and Gathering that all
 
01:20:31.629 --> 01:20:31.639 align:start position:0%
together is going to take us more than
 
01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
just one term so that's what this bill
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
do okay questions for the representative
 
01:20:43.709 --> 01:20:43.719 align:start position:0%
representative n has one thank you I was
 
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
um I had bills being heard in Commerce
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
when we had the first half of this um
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
hearing so I missed it apologize um I'm
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
wondering it who um sold the forest to
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
the party in
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
California so the the carbon credits
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
that were sold on the carb Market were
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
sold by Forest lands group uh in 2012
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
that was the first large sale um the the
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
the continued sale they sold as Mr Le
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
showed on his graph there's that yellow
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
section every year that grows that was
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
continued part of that was being sold by
 
01:21:20.669 --> 01:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
Forest Linger on the California Market
 
01:21:23.709 --> 01:21:23.719 align:start position:0%
every year um this new company purchased
 
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
them um in 20 at the end of 2022 um so
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
that they like they're they're going to
 
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
continue to sell on that market those
 
01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
credits on that market um but that this
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
is about 10% of their total land
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
Holdings Nationwide um so the rest of
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
their credits could be sold anywhere um
 
01:21:44.629 --> 01:21:44.639 align:start position:0%
they may be sold uh blue Source the the
 
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
former name of of Aurora they have been
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
a project developer in this space for a
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
very long time um they are known for you
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
know working with other um companies to
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
sell on the voluntary exchange um so we
 
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know they could be sold
 
01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
anywhere followup I'm not sure I'm
 
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
understanding because the forest itself
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
did the land belong to someone and they
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
and the party sold it to a California
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
company uh it's I mean Aurora I think is
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
based in Texas um but but they sold uh
 
01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
the they bought Forest lands group in
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
all they they acquired them in all of
 
01:22:26.669 --> 01:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
their land Holdings which totaled about
 
01:22:29.229 --> 01:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
1.8 million Acres
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
Countrywide thank you representative or
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
vice chair Thomas has a question thank
 
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
question so you alluded to it a little
 
01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
bit um what effect if this bill did not
 
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
pass what effect would this have on the
 
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
tourist industry in that region um
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
because of the recreational
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities that may or may not be
 
01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.189 align:start position:0%
opportunities that may or may not be
taken

01:22:54.189 --> 01:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
taken
 
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
away I believe representative Le I don't
 
01:22:58.110 --> 01:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
know if he's testifying today but but he
 
01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
did submit testimony um and specifically
 
01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
focused on the recreational aspect of
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
this um the I'm I'm happy to speculate I
 
01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
think that we don't know what the
 
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
long-term impacts of this are I can talk
 
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
about the the worst case scenario um you
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
know the the idea so so beyond
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
just the the uh landowner agreements
 
01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
that we that keep our recreational
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
programs running
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
um it's a lot of almost all of our our
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
recreational work is done on private
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
lands so those Agreements are at the
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
whim of the land owner if land owner
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
shift you know if if our you know land
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
becomes more valuable um you know we
 
01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
could have new foreign land owners come
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
in and shut things down um there's
 
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
questions around soil erosion as Mr Le
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
alluded to the um soil is an important
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
aspect of carbon retention and so yes in
 
01:23:51.629 --> 01:23:51.639 align:start position:0%
some markets you're not going to
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
consider the soil uh in other markets
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
they may and so you may be asked to
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
lower programs or like to um restrict
 
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
programs that could affect your soil uh
 
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
carbon retention and or you could sell
 
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
additional credits by proving that you
 
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:10.280 align:start position:0%
are uh retaining more carbon in in the
 
01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
soil by you know not allowing people to
 
01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
walk on the
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
land I just passed out a letter of
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
testimony from representative wette that
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
addresses the issues that uh Vice chair
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
Thomas was questioning representative
 
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
muns has a question thank you Mr chair
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
my question um you clearly there's a lot
 
01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
that um we need to figure out um as to
 
01:24:43.229 --> 01:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
how this affects New Hampshire um and it
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
seems to me that it would be appropriate
 
01:24:47.070 --> 01:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
to take some time to do that my question
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
for you is uh why do we need to suspend
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
the sale of carbon offsets while we're
 
01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
doing that that that work what why is
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
that so
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
important so my so as they've talked
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
about there are different markets with
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
different requirements for how long your
 
01:25:08.669 --> 01:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
your lease is going to be uh in place
 
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
but if you're selling a 100-year lease
 
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
on a property you know the the uh I
 
01:25:16.669 --> 01:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
would recommend you know if any of you
 
01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
have interest in this um to listen to my
 
01:25:21.109 --> 01:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
testimony for my other two bills which I
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
will happily email out to the committee
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
um they're each 15 minutes long so um if
 
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
you have some nighttime listening that
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
you want to put yourself to bed to um go
 
01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
for it but the the the idea that we are
 
01:25:35.629 --> 01:25:35.639 align:start position:0%
allowing a a 100-year lease on a
 
01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
property or putting giving that you know
 
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
that that that's an option is that so so
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
we could quickly very quickly without
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
before we have time to act you know
 
01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
large swats of New Hampshire Forest land
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
could be locked up um as Mr LEC showed
 
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
in his graph that standing Timber
 
01:25:54.109 --> 01:25:54.119 align:start position:0%
section of the carbon
 
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
sequestration uh is a the large chunk so
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
that's the first chunk and that's where
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
you're saying you know the standing
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
timber that's there when you sell the
 
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
first set of credits that's you're
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
locking that up and you're staying above
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
that level from there on for the next
 
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
100 years so it's that first bit is the
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
huge chunk you know 90% of your credits
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
are going to be sold in that first year
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
that first trench um so the idea that we
 
01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
can slow this down until we can have
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
something in place
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
is is that's why I'm supporting this
 
01:26:28.189 --> 01:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
bill representative Harrington has a
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman thank you
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question there's been a
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion about land use as far
 
01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
as snowmobiling uh and hunting and
 
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
fishing and so forth has anyone that
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
owns these massive amounts of acreage up
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
there shut it off to those
 
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
activities so so far we don't have very
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
many here in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
I think if we look at I'm sorry but but
 
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire is what
 
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
I'm referring to so yes but um so so no
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
none of those companies have said so far
 
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
the 25 oh
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative McGee has a question
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
I have several actually thank you Mr
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you um representative
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
Kelly for taking my question my first
 
01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
question is are you speaking on the
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
amendment that we received in the last
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
hearing because I'm trying to figure out
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
if that is what we are operating from in
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
terms of what the committee is being
 
01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:24.280 align:start position:0%
left with that's just my first Baseline
 
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
question yes I'm I'm speaking about the
 
01:27:29.229 --> 01:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
amendment the I I will admit I've been
 
01:27:31.109 --> 01:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
focused on my other two bills and
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
sheering those through um the I've been
 
01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
allowing representative Davis um to to
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
be the the representable to be the real
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
head on this bill um and I I do know
 
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
that they've been running these things
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
by several different offices as they um
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
work on the language for it so um I
 
01:27:49.950 --> 01:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
trust them and I trust that this process
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
you know that they're trying to do this
 
01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
in the the best way possible for the
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
state follow thank you yes thank you um
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
I didn't even get to any of my questions
 
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
that was just a okay so um in Mr L's uh
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
presentation he made the distinction
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
between the compliance Market which
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
Aurora participates in for the
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
hundred-year lockup of of land and the
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
compliance Mark I'm I'm sorry the the
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary markets for which the leases
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
are 20 to 40 years um and we don't have
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
a registry so we don't know how many
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
people or how much land is currently
 
01:28:27.629 --> 01:28:27.639 align:start position:0%
operating under those two different
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
types of markets but my question is why
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't have any specificity
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
around that because my concern is that
 
01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
the language is very Broad in in the uh
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment it says um it refers to New
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Woodlands that we want the
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
suspension for all New Hampshire
 
01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
Woodlands which means that these smaller
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
voluntary markets would be affected by
 
01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:53.719 align:start position:0%
this moratorium so can you speak to how
 
01:28:57.149 --> 01:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
that would operate to not really
 
01:29:01.229 --> 01:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
um harm the people who are using uh
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
those markets in order to make holding
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
on to their land
 
01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
viable um yeah I'll do I'll do my best
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
my my as I said I I
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
um I've been told that this bill has
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
been run by several different
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
departments State departments that the
 
01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
language has been looked at by by those
 
01:29:22.109 --> 01:29:22.119 align:start position:0%
departments so the the the how it will
 
01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
affect current owners and how it will
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
affect future land future owners I I I'm
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
I'm bowing to them to the those state
 
01:29:33.229 --> 01:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
agencies I'm not a lawyer I'm not a um a
 
01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
tax accountant I'm not anything in
 
01:29:38.669 --> 01:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
particular um so I'm I'm really trusting
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
in them to set the language
 
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately I do think though that
 
01:29:43.629 --> 01:29:43.639 align:start position:0%
although the length of the leases are
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
shorter um the voluntary Market is much
 
01:29:48.109 --> 01:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
larger than the compliance market in
 
01:29:50.189 --> 01:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
terms of the the number and complexity
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
of the of the of the the the voluntary
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
markets we should refer to them as in
 
01:29:56.189 --> 01:29:56.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or in general in gen I
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
mean in general in general there are
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
many many many many many more voluntary
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
markets than there are compliance
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
markets so the um you
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
know they are smaller in terms of lease
 
01:30:11.109 --> 01:30:11.119 align:start position:0%
but they are the the volume could be
 
01:30:11.119 --> 01:30:14.109 align:start position:0%
but they are the the volume could be
much

01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
larger representative bernardy has a
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh so to
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
get a handle on this is is the first
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
step to just have a registry of all the
 
01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
all the Timberlands that potentially
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
available for voluntary or compliance
 
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
markets and then we can we take time to
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
figure out what do we do to get get a
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
better handle on
 
01:30:45.229 --> 01:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
this yeah yes I agree with that
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
sentiment the the question is how do we
 
01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
get the that registry going right now we
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
have APA pa7 intent to cut so when you
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
intend to cut you put you go and you do
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
that uh you file a bill piece of form
 
01:31:00.109 --> 01:31:00.119 align:start position:0%
with the state so you know we don't have
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
something that every land owner has to
 
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
file every year um with that so so they
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
could you know how do we gather that
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
info we do need to have some type of new
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
form or new process to do that yeah um
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
and that that could be the the harder
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
part and then what what actually
 
01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
qualifies for that program as Mr Le
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
talked about the family forest program
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
which is you know you choosing to do set
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
of practices but there are less
 
01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:27.159 align:start position:0%
restrictions put on your property um
 
01:31:29.229 --> 01:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
because they're Gathering a bunch of
 
01:31:30.669 --> 01:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
these smaller land owners together and
 
01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
selling them as a single carbon credit
 
01:31:34.510 --> 01:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
vers you know does that qualify if you
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
only have five acres or seven acres or
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
whatever in that thing versus a single
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
owner selling on a single Market you
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
know what who do we who do we ask to you
 
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
know where where where do we draw the
 
01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:48.280 align:start position:0%
line thank
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
you as a followup to that question if we
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
put a check bark check box on the
 
01:31:57.070 --> 01:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
current use form that you have to fill
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
out to put your property into current
 
01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
use that said is your property involved
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
in a carbon credits program would that
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
be adequate to create the registry that
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
you speak
 
01:32:12.109 --> 01:32:12.119 align:start position:0%
of thank you for the question so the
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
issue the only issue with that is that
 
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
you only have to file that current use
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
paper work once so most the over 60%
 
01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
it's over it's a I've only seen the
 
01:32:24.189 --> 01:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
statistic from 2000 but over 60% of land
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
in current use has been in in current
 
01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
use for over 30 years so most of those
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
land owners have never filed the
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
paperwork they it was passed down from
 
01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
the previous landowner or there they're
 
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
the still the original land owner put it
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
in current use so um the we do you know
 
01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
for those who have their land and Forest
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
stewardship um they do have to file a
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
forest management plan every 10 years
 
01:32:47.109 --> 01:32:47.119 align:start position:0%
that Forest management plan is something
 
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
that we could say we want to know at
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
that time that that that that that
 
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to sell car carbon credits
 
01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
that you plan to intend to sell carbon
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
credits um because the forest management
 
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
plan is going to outline the timber
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
harvesting That was supposed to that
 
01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to do on the land
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
the the again that's only every 10 years
 
01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
so it would take us 10 years until we
 
01:33:07.709 --> 01:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
had complete data and that's only on
 
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
land that's in for stewardship in Coos
 
01:33:11.550 --> 01:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
County that's over 60% but in the rest
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
of the state that's under 30% so we
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
would only get a small subsection of
 
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
everybody um I think that the only way
 
01:33:20.109 --> 01:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
that we can gather a complete data and
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
gather it quickly is by requiring
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
a new form or a new process for doing
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
that um uh just to add just because we
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned current use and um addressing
 
01:33:32.350 --> 01:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
representative Lick's question from
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
before about current use um the the Cur
 
01:33:40.350 --> 01:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
we currently Abate forestry in the state
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
through two two means through a Timber
 
01:33:45.109 --> 01:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
tax and through I know that they hate
 
01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
when I call it an abatement but current
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
through current use the both of those
 
01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
abatements are abatements on your
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
property taxes that are we intend to
 
01:33:56.350 --> 01:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
collect especially in this case of
 
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
Timber tax we intend to collect at a
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
later date we do not assess the value of
 
01:34:02.189 --> 01:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
ttim of growing timber on a property
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
because we will get that Timber tax when
 
01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
we will get that property tax when the
 
01:34:09.550 --> 01:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
timber is harvested that's the town will
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
so both of those programs are born
 
01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
exclusively by local towns so what the
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
loss of the Timber tax revenue is a loss
 
01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:21.880 align:start position:0%
of property taxes in those towns and the
 
01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
majority of the towns where Timber tax
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
plays a huge role in their Town budget
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
are towns where they're already property
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
poor so we're asking them to
 
01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
further not collect property taxes which
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
will lead to higher property taxes in
 
01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:36.950 align:start position:0%
will lead to higher property taxes in
those

01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
towns okay I think I I hope that someone
 
01:34:44.590 --> 01:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
who testifies later on will discuss the
 
01:34:47.629 --> 01:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
possible use of RSA 79 colon 5 to
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
address that Timber tax issue
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative liwicki has another
 
01:34:53.629 --> 01:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman it's
 
01:34:56.430 --> 01:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
more of a followup but uh when a
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
property is sold they uh obviously are
 
01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
records with the county the state and so
 
01:35:06.030 --> 01:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
forth and if at that time one were to
 
01:35:07.950 --> 01:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
determine that the property has moved
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
from current forestry management use or
 
01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
Farm use into some other usage um would
 
01:35:18.669 --> 01:35:18.679 align:start position:0%
that not trigger the current use uh
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
10-year back taxes and so forth if it's
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
land yes a land use change tax if if the
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
property had changed the argument is
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
that this isn't a CH you're not changing
 
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
you're still growing trees you're still
 
01:35:37.870 --> 01:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
growing forest and so under the current
 
01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
definitions in our state
 
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
RSA it's still Forest land I think that
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
current use the the law defines Forest
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
land and farmland but then it defines
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
unproductive land the third category
 
01:35:54.270 --> 01:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
unproductive land is specifically says
 
01:35:56.430 --> 01:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
it's for land where Forest Products
 
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
cannot be cultivated cannot be uh cannot
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
be harvested it says harvested so to me
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
if you are no longer harvesting the the
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
property then you are no longer you are
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
no longer a forest land because
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise they would have said
 
01:36:16.109 --> 01:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
unproductive lands just anything that
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
that doesn't qualify as Forest land so
 
01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's pretty clear in the
 
01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
RSA and that's my opinion but again I'm
 
01:36:25.149 --> 01:36:25.159 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer and I can't speak to
 
01:36:27.149 --> 01:36:27.159 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
01:36:30.189 --> 01:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Kaplan has a
 
01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
you representative for coming in um
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're tending to stray a
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
little bit into how to solve this
 
01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
problem generally in instead of talking
 
01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
about the bill so I I don't feel like
 
01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be remiss if I ask you to
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
describe uh any kind of alternative
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
taxing uh structure that might actually
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
solve this problem so I I know you have
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
some ideas about that could you could
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
you describe those to the committee
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you yeah so my my Timber
 
01:37:00.189 --> 01:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
tax bill um that I put forward is an
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
attempt to do that the question it like
 
01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:04.360 align:start position:0%
as we mentioned there are number of
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
markets where these are sold they are
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
sold for number of years they're sold
 
01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
with many different level you know
 
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
different ways to calculate what a
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
carbon credit is so it's an extremely
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
complex mathematical document how do we
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
boil that down into something that can
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
be assessed by a local assessor's office
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
especially when that person may not be a
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
full-time assessing official it might
 
01:37:29.149 --> 01:37:29.159 align:start position:0%
just be you know um and that's the
 
01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
question they actually asked when they
 
01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
formed the original Timber tax same
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
question um my attempt was to say look
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
they have this document that they have
 
01:37:42.109 --> 01:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
to file with a um with a private um
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
registry so like there is a private um
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
there is a business that they are
 
01:37:49.709 --> 01:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to have a certifier look at
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
their document and show that they're
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
math checks out um we we take that
 
01:37:57.229 --> 01:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
document we ask them to boil those
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
numbers down and put them on a single
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
form for our local assessing officials
 
01:38:03.149 --> 01:38:03.159 align:start position:0%
they file that document along with that
 
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
that paperwork that they're already
 
01:38:08.109 --> 01:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
filing to their their certifier and then
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
we use th that number to create uh an
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
estimate for what's going to grow on the
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
property over the length of their
 
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
contract we then assess that we give
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
that um we we take that number uh amount
 
01:38:23.589 --> 01:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
of Timber that they're planning to grow
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
and we say over the length of the
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
contract you owe that to the town so if
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's 100 years or if that's 50 years
 
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
you divide that by 50 and you that's how
 
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
much you owe per year to the town the
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
the my bill specifically says that if
 
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
it's a 100 year lease or 50 years is the
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
maximum for that number saying that if
 
01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
the length of the uh the crediting
 
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
period that's what they call it is over
 
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
50 years then OS at the the rate over 50
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
years assuming that you would have
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
rotated twice through the property or
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
you would have gone through the property
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
once over that 50e period so I'm going
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
to ask you to stop right there I find it
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
confusing that you're offering testimony
 
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
on a bill that's not even before us
 
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
sorry as a way of testifying on this
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
bill and I know that executive counselor
 
01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
Tenny has come to this hearing room
 
01:39:20.109 --> 01:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
twice now to testify on this bill so I
 
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
would really like to to uh allow him to
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
testify cuz he's a very busy man and uh
 
01:39:29.310 --> 01:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
so would it be all right with you if if
 
01:39:32.189 --> 01:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
you yielded the table thank you I and
 
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to stick around to the end in
 
01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
case there are more questions thank you
 
01:39:38.030 --> 01:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that executive counselor
 
01:39:40.189 --> 01:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
Tenny sorry to keep you waiting so long
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
I know you want to testify on this bill
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate you being here it's
 
01:39:45.790 --> 01:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
good to see you
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
sir don't forget to turn on the mic
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you good to see you Mr chairman
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
and committee members uh just for the
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
record I'm Joe Kenny executive Council
 
01:39:57.790 --> 01:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
District 1 uh representing um kind of
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
the three Northern counties um bnap
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
County and uh a lot of land um and this
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
topic is obviously uh very important
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
topic uh for my part of the state I also
 
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
was a 14-year legislator so I appreciate
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
your service uh I got a pay increase
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
when I went to the executive Council so
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
here I am and uh hopefully no one runs
 
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
against me next time I need that
 
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
um we're grappling with this I can see
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
the committee is really grappling with
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
this topic it's not an easy topic um and
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
we know we're reading articles
 
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
throughout the country the New Yorker
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
wrote a great article which I'll give to
 
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
the committee late last year on the same
 
01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
topic but you know it starts with the
 
01:40:44.109 --> 01:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
Kyoto agreements and talks about the the
 
01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
various Nations that bought into carbon
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
tax credit programs and the availability
 
01:40:53.070 --> 01:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
of that um but there's been a lot of
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful tries at this uh carbon tax
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
offset program and so it's a developing
 
01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
Market if you will but for New Hampshire
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
on the executive branch of government um
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
we have no information on this this
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
program um in talking to the Dr
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner Lindy step um there is no
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
um way of assessing the carbon tax
 
01:41:23.709 --> 01:41:23.719 align:start position:0%
credit uh program that exists in the
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
state and and as such we we create in
 
01:41:31.589 --> 01:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
2022 about 3.6 million in Timber tax for
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
for the state across the communities a
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
year before that it was 3.5 million and
 
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
in 2020 it was 2.8 million so so what is
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
the impact well the impact is you know
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
the communities if if all communities
 
01:41:49.109 --> 01:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
went to carbon tax credit programs we
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
could lose several millions of dollars
 
01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
of Revenue at the local level cuz there
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
currently is nothing in place that
 
01:41:57.390 --> 01:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
allows us to really assess the carbon
 
01:41:59.550 --> 01:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
tax credit and bring it back to the
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
local community now someone had
 
01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:03.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned about you know the statute
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
that talks about assessing growth of
 
01:42:07.950 --> 01:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
land and that you know there's an
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that in talking with
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner um Lindsay steep uh it's
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
only been done one time in their
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
recollection that was in um the City of
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
Laconia so for all intents and purposes
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
that alone is we have a huge gap on how
 
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
are we going to assess the carbon tax
 
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
credit and its impact now that's on the
 
01:42:35.709 --> 01:42:35.719 align:start position:0%
Dr side now on the the forest and land
 
01:42:40.030 --> 01:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
side um it would be nice to know which
 
01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
properties in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
are involved in this program um there is
 
01:42:47.550 --> 01:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
no one in state government in the
 
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
executive branch that can tell you who
 
01:42:53.109 --> 01:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
who's in the carbon tax program and
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
who's not that's a very you know scary
 
01:43:00.189 --> 01:43:00.199 align:start position:0%
Revelation in this sense is that you
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
have something in essence that has
 
01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
climbed into the state for the most part
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
unknowingly that's having an impact on
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
your economy and I'm talking about our
 
01:43:12.430 --> 01:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
you know harvesting you know industry
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
and you know the wood products we're
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
always talking about we've got a crisis
 
01:43:18.430 --> 01:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
with housing what what do we build
 
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
houses with wood and suddenly we stop
 
01:43:23.950 --> 01:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
harvesting wood in the state of New
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's going to have an impact
 
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
on our housing market and the cost so to
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
me um that's another issue I think that
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
forest and lands can't really identify
 
01:43:37.149 --> 01:43:37.159 align:start position:0%
who's participating in it and uh I'll
 
01:43:39.589 --> 01:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
also say at the federal
 
01:43:42.109 --> 01:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
level the federal lands are not used for
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
carbon tax credit programs the state
 
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
lands are not used for the carbon tax
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
programs or offset programs however this
 
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
is really really being driven by the
 
01:43:56.189 --> 01:43:56.199 align:start position:0%
private land ownership but I have heard
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
via phone calls through the forest um or
 
01:44:02.189 --> 01:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
the for society who own 200,000
 
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
Acres um they're interested in it and I
 
01:44:07.629 --> 01:44:07.639 align:start position:0%
know that there are some land trust who
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
are involved in it uh who definitely
 
01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
interested if they're participating in
 
01:44:15.550 --> 01:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
it but I don't know um unless I ask
 
01:44:17.629 --> 01:44:17.639 align:start position:0%
someone are you participating in this
 
01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:20.719 align:start position:0%
carbon offset program so the question is
 
01:44:25.990 --> 01:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
is should public lands in the future or
 
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
people who receive public taxpayers
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
money be eligible to use carbon offsets
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
I don't have the answer I don't think
 
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
the committee has the answer but that is
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
a dilemma that we're going to have to
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
work through as a state and other states
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
across the country are grappling with
 
01:44:47.550 --> 01:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
this issue as well and if you look at um
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
um the federal law there is no uh
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
Federal carbon tax credit or uh Federal
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
carbon tax in the in the country at all
 
01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
there's no State who has a carbon tax
 
01:44:59.199 --> 01:45:00.229 align:start position:0%
there's no State who has a carbon tax
doesn't

01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
exist so we have to in talking to
 
01:45:06.910 --> 01:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
Lindsay stear Dr commissioner we have to
 
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
figure out how to quantify it but in a
 
01:45:12.669 --> 01:45:12.679 align:start position:0%
userfriendly manner because uh we know
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
that there's impact with insect
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
infestation we know there's impact with
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
Force fires and God knows we've had our
 
01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
ice storms here in New Hampshire
 
01:45:23.149 --> 01:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
so that would be another impact on
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
carbon sequestration and how to quantify
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know when there is a natural
 
01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
disaster and what impact it would have
 
01:45:34.109 --> 01:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
on that land and how to quantify how you
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
assess it so I can go on and I know
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
you've had a lot of great testimony I
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
can tell by the questions that you're a
 
01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
lot smarter than you were the last
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
hearing um which is a good thing uh
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're learning as we're going but we're
 
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
all learning as we're going that's the
 
01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
reality this is a tough tough topic but
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
as someone who grew up in the state
 
01:45:57.750 --> 01:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
who's got a gut feeling something's aai
 
01:46:01.470 --> 01:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
here something's wrong um I I listen I
 
01:46:03.310 --> 01:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
have a lot of respect for the ESG
 
01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
companies they're driven by this
 
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
ideology that we're going to save the
 
01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:10.360 align:start position:0%
world and you know climate change we got
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
to prevent it and this might be a way of
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
doing it to offset you know pollution on
 
01:46:17.709 --> 01:46:17.719 align:start position:0%
the west coast and using our East Coast
 
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
lands to offset that but I have to say
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
for the traditions of our state the you
 
01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
know our lumber and logging Traditions
 
01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
which go back not decades but centuries
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
we didn't do so well in the 19th century
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
we found out the deforesting Our Land
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't a a good approach but our forest
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast today are fairly mature
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
and so um we have managed to land well
 
01:46:47.229 --> 01:46:47.239 align:start position:0%
through our our Timber industry we know
 
01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
that cutting trees and selective cutting
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh is is a good thing and and it brings
 
01:46:55.709 --> 01:46:55.719 align:start position:0%
you know an actual a rebirth to the
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
forest and and and actually sequestering
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
carbon actually goes on a lot quicker
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
when you manage your your Force but one
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that we did was we
 
01:47:08.910 --> 01:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
educated ourselves like we're doing now
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
we went to the University of New
 
01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we went to UNH corporate
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
extension how can we work with our
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
Timber industry to better manage our
 
01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
forest the undergrowth you know our
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
Wildlife our Rivers waterways and we've
 
01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
done an excellent job here in New
 
01:47:27.149 --> 01:47:27.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would hate to see that be
 
01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
totally disrupted by this new phenomenon
 
01:47:34.109 --> 01:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
called the carbon tax offset that
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
totally just bottles up our land for a
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
use for what it was intended for which
 
01:47:42.189 --> 01:47:42.199 align:start position:0%
is to Forest it in a good way good
 
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
management practices and so that um
 
01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to use it for uh our
 
01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
Commodities which we need on a daily
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
basis so with that I I know you've got
 
01:47:54.629 --> 01:47:54.639 align:start position:0%
my testimony uh from last time around so
 
01:47:56.510 --> 01:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
I won't belabor
 
01:47:58.390 --> 01:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
anymore thank you counselor we
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here quick
 
01:48:04.270 --> 01:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
question this subject seems to beg for a
 
01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:06.639 align:start position:0%
study committee because there's so many
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
questions that need to be
 
01:48:12.669 --> 01:48:12.679 align:start position:0%
answered but do you think that a
 
01:48:15.709 --> 01:48:15.719 align:start position:0%
moratorium is also essential at this
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
point in time or do you think there
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
is sufficient time to study this
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
question get the answers we need before
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
filing legislation that has any effect
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
Market well and I think that's really
 
01:48:33.629 --> 01:48:33.639 align:start position:0%
the bottomline question do we need the
 
01:48:38.709 --> 01:48:38.719 align:start position:0%
moratorium right now um if we don't get
 
01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
everybody if we can't get everyone to
 
01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
the table the answer is
 
01:48:45.550 --> 01:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
yes if we can get everybody to the table
 
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
today and we want to do a study
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee the answer is yes but we have
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
to get the players out there who know
 
01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
what they're up to they know what
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
they're doing as far as the the open
 
01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
market with regards to this this you
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
know carbon offset um if they're willing
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
to come to the table now and let us know
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
who they are around the state and we can
 
01:49:15.229 --> 01:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
eventually have Dr be able to go into
 
01:49:18.189 --> 01:49:18.199 align:start position:0%
their financial form on a yearly basis
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
to know who's you know got carbon tax
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
credit program on on their land um that
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
I think um you know
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
having um the ability for them to say
 
01:49:36.430 --> 01:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
yes then the moratorium um might be left
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
with a study committee but I think the
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
whole idea of a moratorium is to get
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
everyone's attention and get them to the
 
01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
table um and so I don't know that answer
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
because right now I know there's land
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
all over the state that's involved in
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
this this program but you and I don't
 
01:49:54.149 --> 01:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
know who they are and who's
 
01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
participating and so I think they need
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
to come forward um and let us know and
 
01:50:01.950 --> 01:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
come to the table but I don't know who
 
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
the I I mean this and I want to make it
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
clear there seems to be a focus on the
 
01:50:10.350 --> 01:50:10.360 align:start position:0%
uh the Connecticut headquarters property
 
01:50:12.030 --> 01:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
you know that's a it's always been a
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
public private partnership up there um
 
01:50:17.669 --> 01:50:17.679 align:start position:0%
we have agreements with them so yeah the
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
state has a little bit more leverage if
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
you will with working with that
 
01:50:23.629 --> 01:50:23.639 align:start position:0%
ownership but I'm just talking as a
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide policy I don't know these
 
01:50:28.350 --> 01:50:28.360 align:start position:0%
other players that are in our state and
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
a moratorium would bring them to the
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
table real
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
quick but if we say they'll come to the
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
table voluntarily and you want to set it
 
01:50:39.709 --> 01:50:39.719 align:start position:0%
up into a study committee to figure out
 
01:50:42.069 --> 01:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
how we can work with this new market how
 
01:50:44.589 --> 01:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
we can assess it and how we can manage
 
01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
it as a state that I'm all in on that as
 
01:50:49.629 --> 01:50:49.639 align:start position:0%
well but I think that that is the uh the
 
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
01:50:52.990 --> 01:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you appreciate that
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
answer representative McGee has a
 
01:50:58.109 --> 01:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
you um executive counselor Kenny for
 
01:51:02.669 --> 01:51:02.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm looking again at
 
01:51:04.229 --> 01:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill which says
 
01:51:06.990 --> 01:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
suspension of sale of carbon credits and
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
maybe you could help us understand you
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
keep mentioning Dr but the bill actually
 
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
says the department of cultural and
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
natural resources shall suspend the sale
 
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
of carbon credits and offsets from The
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
Woodlands of New Hampshire for two years
 
01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
from the effective date of this act uh
 
01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
so that we can uh so the general court
 
01:51:28.030 --> 01:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
can develop a plan to properly regulate
 
01:51:30.430 --> 01:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
such sale do they actually have the
 
01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
ability or the authority to suspend
 
01:51:36.510 --> 01:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
those sales because those sales are not
 
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
going through the government in New
 
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire correct so I I don't
 
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
understand how we would implement this
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
if we pass it as it's written um I don't
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
have a clear crystal clear answer for
 
01:51:50.669 --> 01:51:50.679 align:start position:0%
you but I do know one thing um when it
 
01:51:52.149 --> 01:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
comes to a
 
01:51:56.030 --> 01:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
moratorium um I would step into the
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and say which
 
01:52:02.430 --> 01:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
agency that that moratorium um who who
 
01:52:03.790 --> 01:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
should be the sponsorship of that
 
01:52:05.870 --> 01:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
moratorium or who should have the
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
authority um or or the oversight for
 
01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
that matter and I would just double
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
check with the Attorney General's office
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
on that because again you you're making
 
01:52:17.709 --> 01:52:17.719 align:start position:0%
a a big leap when you set down a
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
moratorium so you want to make sure you
 
01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
have your your ducks in line
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
particularly on the uh the chain of
 
01:52:27.790 --> 01:52:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
that followup I have so many questions
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
um so the other piece of it again I'll
 
01:52:35.310 --> 01:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
just refer back to the language that's
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
in um the amendment that we've been
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
asked to review for passage the last
 
01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
sentence says if this act is deemed
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional any person who has
 
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
entered into a contract to purchase sell
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
or trade carbon credits or offsets
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
that was affected by the suspension of
 
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
the sale of carbon credits and offsets
 
01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
may still be liable for any rules or
 
01:52:59.229 --> 01:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
taxes pertaining to such
 
01:53:03.149 --> 01:53:03.159 align:start position:0%
contract um so in effect what it's
 
01:53:06.629 --> 01:53:06.639 align:start position:0%
saying is if we create a moratorium that
 
01:53:10.270 --> 01:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
says uh that we will not allow credits
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
to be managed we are also trying to send
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
a signal to people who are participating
 
01:53:17.229 --> 01:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
in the market that any liabilities that
 
01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
you have as a result a as a result of
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
you know your participation you're still
 
01:53:25.629 --> 01:53:25.639 align:start position:0%
liable for um so we're basically saying
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
we're stopping everything but don't
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
worry and I'm not sure that that works
 
01:53:33.149 --> 01:53:33.159 align:start position:0%
very well with markets I'm just not sure
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
how this uh would affect uh all the
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
people that are participating currently
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
in that market so my way of looking at a
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
moratorium is the previous entrance into
 
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
the market are in the market but the
 
01:53:51.069 --> 01:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
folks who want to join join you know the
 
01:53:53.189 --> 01:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
market in New Hampshire under a
 
01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
moratorium would have to wait until we
 
01:53:57.229 --> 01:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
get through some of these important
 
01:53:59.870 --> 01:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
issues so we can best manage this
 
01:54:02.109 --> 01:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
program in our state and and to
 
01:54:03.390 --> 01:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
understand what we're doing and what
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
we'll be doing in the future because
 
01:54:07.149 --> 01:54:07.159 align:start position:0%
every state in the country most likely
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
is going through this right
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
now Mr chair yeah over here a point of
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
clarification where is this amendment I
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
haven't received a copy it was passed
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
out at the public hearing a week ago so
 
01:54:25.470 --> 01:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
it's probably amongst your okay your
 
01:54:28.229 --> 01:54:28.239 align:start position:0%
information somewhere I don't okay thank
 
01:54:30.069 --> 01:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
you I'd like to move on representative
 
01:54:33.069 --> 01:54:33.079 align:start position:0%
McGee representative muns has a question
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
counselor for uh taking my question um
 
01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
it it it seems
 
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
um it seems that one of the biggest
 
01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
issues and you alluded to it as well is
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
that um we really need to get our arms
 
01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
around how prevalent this activity is
 
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire um you you know the
 
01:54:58.350 --> 01:54:58.360 align:start position:0%
executive branch much better than than I
 
01:55:02.430 --> 01:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
do um and I guess my my question is um
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
what is per there must
 
01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
be an an agency or agencies within the
 
01:55:13.629 --> 01:55:13.639 align:start position:0%
executive branch that has a listing of
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
property landholders in New Hampshire
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
what is preventing the Executive Branch
 
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
from going out and just
 
01:55:22.229 --> 01:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
asking those people whether they're
 
01:55:25.069 --> 01:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
participating in this um kind of a
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
program or not well number one it would
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
be have to be a voluntary program and
 
01:55:32.589 --> 01:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure some people like to
 
01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
volunteer their
 
01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
information um but with the current use
 
01:55:38.910 --> 01:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
program out there that information is
 
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
already collected at the state level and
 
01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
obviously because of Revenue purposes um
 
01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
and I heard earlier that you know the
 
01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
approach might be that we work with Dr
 
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
to say okay you're going to be the
 
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
agency that
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
identifies you know who is you know
 
01:55:58.030 --> 01:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
collecting whatever whatever Revenue
 
01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
under this um carbon tax program and
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
then you're going to be responsible not
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
only for collecting the data but also
 
01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
administrating the um you know whatever
 
01:56:10.510 --> 01:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
the assessing fee or whatever is
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
involved that's yet to be determined
 
01:56:14.109 --> 01:56:14.119 align:start position:0%
what we're going to you know potentially
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
call it so but it's a collaborative
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
effort before um between force and Lance
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
and Department of re Revenue
 
01:56:23.470 --> 01:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
Administration um as they do
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
collaboratively work with the current
 
01:56:28.069 --> 01:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
use program so um it's going to take
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
probably uh two entities at minimum um
 
01:56:34.189 --> 01:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
there might be a third but um to
 
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
administrate you know this program quick
 
01:56:39.709 --> 01:56:39.719 align:start position:0%
follow quick followup make it very quick
 
01:56:43.310 --> 01:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
please um so it so it sounds like what
 
01:56:48.189 --> 01:56:48.199 align:start position:0%
would be um useful to move this forward
 
01:56:52.030 --> 01:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
is have language that requires Property
 
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
Owners to disclose this information
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
which is not part of this bill right now
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
as I read it right um the you know when
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
I first said that I would show up here
 
01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
today and support a moratorium it was
 
01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
really to kind of you know okay let's
 
01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
start from square one again and try to
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
look at these issues and create you know
 
01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
a committee to review some of the
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
answers or some of the policy issues
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire might move out in the
 
01:57:20.589 --> 01:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
future on you know carvon offset
 
01:57:25.149 --> 01:57:25.159 align:start position:0%
um it was not my intent to make sausage
 
01:57:27.149 --> 01:57:27.159 align:start position:0%
here you know at the Committee hearing
 
01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
and try to because I I don't think it's
 
01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
a useful exercise because you know one
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
is you know we're going off in so many
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
different directions I think from my
 
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint if I were a legislator and I
 
01:57:42.910 --> 01:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
have been one I would want to know okay
 
01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
who they are have a list reg stre to
 
01:57:48.750 --> 01:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
identify who they are number two figure
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
out how to to assess that okay and
 
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
number three um make sure that it's it's
 
01:57:58.990 --> 01:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
a legal Market operating here in New
 
01:58:01.229 --> 01:58:01.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay and I mean that and I'm
 
01:58:03.069 --> 01:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
sure that you know the the companies
 
01:58:05.069 --> 01:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
will say they are and I'm sure they are
 
01:58:06.669 --> 01:58:06.679 align:start position:0%
but you know they're registered with the
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and they're
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
functioning as an honest company here in
 
01:58:14.589 --> 01:58:14.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and and obviously you know
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
those would be the you know the three
 
01:58:18.069 --> 01:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
things that I would want minimally out
 
01:58:20.229 --> 01:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
of a piece of legislation
 
01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
and uh as far as you know can we achieve
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
that in in a certain period of time the
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
answer is absolutely yes um but the
 
01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
moratorium is to get everybody to the
 
01:58:35.470 --> 01:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
table okay well I will defend our
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
committee and say that we are sausage
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
makers in
 
01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
here we do this a lot but I want to
 
01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
thank you councelor for thank much
 
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:44.960 align:start position:0%

we have 11 pink cards yet to go and uh
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
it's 11:00 so in order to get through
 
01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
all these we're going to have to hustle
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
either that or skip lunch one of the
 
01:59:00.069 --> 01:59:00.079 align:start position:0%

01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:15.800 align:start position:0%
succinct explanation of what the problem
 
01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
is and a possible way to solve it thank
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%

committee good morning and uh what I am
 
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
going to attempt to do is to give you a
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%

pockets and I want to buy
 
02:00:24.310 --> 02:00:24.320 align:start position:0%

legally I really don't care if this
 
02:01:09.870 --> 02:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
shuts down the Sawmills the trucking
 
02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:13.560 align:start position:0%

02:01:20.189 --> 02:01:20.199 align:start position:0%
I'm here to make money I'm a businessman
 
02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:22.639 align:start position:0%
I bought the land I paid for it it's a
 
02:01:22.639 --> 02:01:24.109 align:start position:0%
I bought the land I paid for it it's a
done

02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
deal we in New Hampshire cannot afford
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
that your constituents cannot afford
 
02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
that I cannot afford that and my friends
 
02:01:35.629 --> 02:01:35.639 align:start position:0%
and neighbors cannot afford that we
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
cannot buy New Hampshire and shut it
 
02:01:43.390 --> 02:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
down that's the
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
Dilemma the last point is this this bill
 
02:01:51.750 --> 02:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
does not do anything in regards to
 
02:01:54.069 --> 02:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
regulations it doesn't say you can you
 
02:01:56.589 --> 02:01:56.599 align:start position:0%
can't you shall you shall not none of
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
that what this bill
 
02:02:02.069 --> 02:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
says we're going to look at all of the
 
02:02:05.229 --> 02:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
angles which are very complex and
 
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
involved we are going to look at all of
 
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
these angles for the next two years so
 
02:02:16.069 --> 02:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire gets it
 
02:02:20.109 --> 02:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
right we are going to Lumber and harvest
 
02:02:23.109 --> 02:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
Lumber we are going to sell tax credits
 
02:02:26.669 --> 02:02:26.679 align:start position:0%
and make money we are not going to put
 
02:02:29.069 --> 02:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
Mom and Pop at the grocery store out of
 
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
business or the Seesaw sawmill in Coos
 
02:02:34.750 --> 02:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
County out of business doing
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
it we are going to study this and make
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
it right that's what this bill does and
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
I suspect that we desperately need a
 
02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated committee to look into all the
 
02:02:53.950 --> 02:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
aspects of this bill so that New
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does get it right with that Mr
 
02:03:00.669 --> 02:03:00.679 align:start position:0%
chairman pretty close to three minutes
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
yeah yes excellent I knew that you would
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
give us a succinct and compelling
 
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
argument about what we should do with
 
02:03:10.669 --> 02:03:10.679 align:start position:0%
this bill so thank you thank you and I
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
will not take questions because it's an
 
02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:15.719 align:start position:0%
overview either you buy it or you don't
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
but anyway in the spirit of time I'll
 
02:03:20.589 --> 02:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
conclud pull it down thank you thank you
 
02:03:23.550 --> 02:03:23.560 align:start position:0%

Commissioners uh who have asked me to
 
02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
speak in support of this bill um let me
 
02:04:03.549 --> 02:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
also state that in addition to
 
02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
representing the County Commissioners I
 
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
also represent the towns of Pittsburgh
 
02:04:14.109 --> 02:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
colbrook Columbia arol Lancaster and
 
02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
shelburn so I have a rather uh diverse
 
02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh Municipal client base within Coos
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
County specifically and I should also
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
add with with respect to the Pittsburgh
 
02:04:27.790 --> 02:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
tract I hunt and snowmobile on that
 
02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:29.750 align:start position:0%
tract I hunt and snowmobile on that
tract

02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
tract
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
regularly with respect to the
 
02:04:36.430 --> 02:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
information uh one of the questions that
 
02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh the chairman asked about uh was
 
02:04:43.229 --> 02:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
specifically with respect to RSA 79
 
02:04:43.239 --> 02:04:44.350 align:start position:0%
specifically with respect to RSA 79
colon

02:04:44.350 --> 02:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
colon
 
02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
5 the RSA that suggests that if a land
 
02:04:51.149 --> 02:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
owner is not cutting Timber uh what can
 
02:04:54.549 --> 02:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
the local municipality do about it and
 
02:04:56.350 --> 02:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
my frame of reference as I said I'm here
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the Coos County
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who are concerned about
 
02:05:02.149 --> 02:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
the current
 
02:05:05.709 --> 02:05:05.719 align:start position:0%
situation but also what situation might
 
02:05:08.030 --> 02:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
be happening down the road what what
 
02:05:10.149 --> 02:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
real estate closing could be happening
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
today as we sit here today there could
 
02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
be another real estate closing which is
 
02:05:16.589 --> 02:05:16.599 align:start position:0%
affected which these issues are
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
affecting I'm going to go to the example
 
02:05:22.350 --> 02:05:22.360 align:start position:0%
of Pittsburgh uh I do represent the town
 
02:05:24.310 --> 02:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
of Pittsburgh the Pittsburgh Selectmen
 
02:05:25.990 --> 02:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
have estimated that they are going to
 
02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
lose approximately $200,000 in Timber
 
02:05:31.109 --> 02:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
tax from the land the
 
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
historical the historical cutting that
 
02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
has happened in Pittsburgh on these
 
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
lands the Selectmen have estimated that
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
amount that they're going to lose that
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
amount um and although I am a strong
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
support of private property rights and
 
02:05:46.189 --> 02:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
and of the freedom of the marketplace
 
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
these issues do have a a consequence on
 
02:05:52.030 --> 02:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
the local communities and how it affects
 
02:05:54.669 --> 02:05:54.679 align:start position:0%
the entire local communities tax base
 
02:05:56.350 --> 02:05:56.360 align:start position:0%
and everyone's property rights put
 
02:05:58.189 --> 02:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
together so with respect to the
 
02:06:02.270 --> 02:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
Chairman's question on 79 colon 5 the
 
02:06:04.030 --> 02:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh selectman without revealing
 
02:06:06.510 --> 02:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
anything that I would describe to fall
 
02:06:07.870 --> 02:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
within the scope of attorney client
 
02:06:10.189 --> 02:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
privilege generally speaking if we are
 
02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
looking at that statute and because I do
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
go to court and I litigate cases
 
02:06:16.030 --> 02:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
including at the New Hampshire Supreme
 
02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
Court one question is what do we need to
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
do in order to use that statute well
 
02:06:24.270 --> 02:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
first under the rules of Court going to
 
02:06:26.470 --> 02:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
have to have some expert Witnesses it's
 
02:06:28.669 --> 02:06:28.679 align:start position:0%
not simply enough for a select board to
 
02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
say we're going to use RSA 795 and say
 
02:06:34.270 --> 02:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to tax this Timber there's
 
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
going to be an appeal of that instantly
 
02:06:39.950 --> 02:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
in order to litigate that case I've got
 
02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
to have two expert witnesses number one
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
I've got to have a
 
02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
Forester number two I've got to have a
 
02:06:47.629 --> 02:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
real estate appraiser right off the bat
 
02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
so the town of Pitts ber losing a couple
 
02:06:53.109 --> 02:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
$1,000 per year in Timber taxes now says
 
02:06:55.069 --> 02:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
to its attorney what do we need to
 
02:06:58.549 --> 02:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
budget in order to use RSA 795 to try to
 
02:07:00.510 --> 02:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
deal with this issue well we're going to
 
02:07:03.149 --> 02:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
need $20,000 for this expert witness
 
02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to need another $20,000 for
 
02:07:06.750 --> 02:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
an expert witness oh and by the way we
 
02:07:08.229 --> 02:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
ought to put your legal fees into the
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
budget also so now we're up to $60,000
 
02:07:14.350 --> 02:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
$75,000 worth of legal and expert fees
 
02:07:16.390 --> 02:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
to use a statute which which was
 
02:07:18.990 --> 02:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
designed many years ago but was isn't
 
02:07:20.549 --> 02:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
specifically designed for the sort of
 
02:07:22.109 --> 02:07:22.119 align:start position:0%
circumstance that we're in front of
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
right now there's a court case and then
 
02:07:26.350 --> 02:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
it goes to the Supreme Court we need to
 
02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
tack on another 20 to
 
02:07:30.669 --> 02:07:30.679 align:start position:0%
$25,000 for the legal fees and possible
 
02:07:32.350 --> 02:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
other fees connected with an appeal to
 
02:07:34.549 --> 02:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court all to
 
02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
try to figure out how can we use a
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
statute which is clearly on the books
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
but can we use that Statute in this
 
02:07:43.109 --> 02:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
circumstance it's going to be a very
 
02:07:45.549 --> 02:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
expensive proposition for a town to
 
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
mount that battle while at the same time
 
02:07:51.069 --> 02:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
losing the tax revenue associated with
 
02:07:52.669 --> 02:07:52.679 align:start position:0%
the harvesting
 
02:07:54.589 --> 02:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
operations that's with respect to the
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
town of Pittsburgh with respect to Coos
 
02:07:58.390 --> 02:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
County as I said the Commissioners have
 
02:08:00.589 --> 02:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
asked me to testify today I thought I
 
02:08:01.830 --> 02:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
would answer the Chairman's direct
 
02:08:03.790 --> 02:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
question the chair the Commissioners are
 
02:08:05.790 --> 02:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
more concerned about what could happen
 
02:08:07.549 --> 02:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
with any of the other large blocks of
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
Timberland that fall within their
 
02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction specifically within the
 
02:08:12.870 --> 02:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
unincorporated places so I'm here in
 
02:08:14.549 --> 02:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
support of the bill and thank you very
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
much for allowing me to testify thank
 
02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate you answering my
 
02:08:20.669 --> 02:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
question about RSA
 
02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
795 representative Harrington has a
 
02:08:26.229 --> 02:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
question so I'm thank you uh chairman
 
02:08:27.549 --> 02:08:27.559 align:start position:0%
thank you take my question I'm so I'm
 
02:08:29.310 --> 02:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
trying to follow the logic here it
 
02:08:31.470 --> 02:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
appears what you're saying is that
 
02:08:33.629 --> 02:08:33.639 align:start position:0%
because if someone decides to sign a
 
02:08:35.310 --> 02:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
contract where they won't cut timber
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
down then the town or the municipality
 
02:08:40.510 --> 02:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
will lose Timber tax money so therefore
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to hurt them so what else
 
02:08:46.830 --> 02:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
could people not do let's say I bought
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
10,000 acres in Coos County and it had a
 
02:08:54.109 --> 02:08:54.119 align:start position:0%
big huge mansion on it that was uh being
 
02:08:57.990 --> 02:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
taxed at Value to 10 million the house
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
now I say I want to restore that to
 
02:09:01.629 --> 02:09:01.639 align:start position:0%
Wilderness so I'm going to tear down the
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
house obviously now then tax base is
 
02:09:05.470 --> 02:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
going to go down for Coos County
 
02:09:07.470 --> 02:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
whatever town it's in so am I allowed to
 
02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
do that or he'll say no no no you cannot
 
02:09:11.709 --> 02:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
do anything that reduce your tax base
 
02:09:14.709 --> 02:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
because that'll cost the town money no
 
02:09:16.589 --> 02:09:16.599 align:start position:0%
that private property rights are still
 
02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
extremely important the question is the
 
02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
systemic effect the systemic effect
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
primarily from a large historically the
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
way that a large tract of Timberland has
 
02:09:29.229 --> 02:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
been historically managed that has a
 
02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
ripple effect throughout the entire
 
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
community and throughout that specific
 
02:09:36.350 --> 02:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the uh tax base of that
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
specific Town private property rights
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
still need to be respected however what
 
02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
this Bill calls for is simply a
 
02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
moratorium to figure out how do we
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
manage that how do we manage that during
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
the short term while still protecting
 
02:09:52.750 --> 02:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders uh representative Kaplan
 
02:09:57.629 --> 02:09:57.639 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you uh Mr chair and
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in uh I know this
 
02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
question's been asked before but maybe
 
02:10:02.430 --> 02:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
you can maybe you can uh offer your
 
02:10:04.470 --> 02:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
opinion as well uh from what we've heard
 
02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
this moratorium will have little effect
 
02:10:08.549 --> 02:10:08.559 align:start position:0%
on the on the current contract that the
 
02:10:10.270 --> 02:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
large landowner that we're talking about
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
is is U you know holds the with the
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
carbon uh Market in California so can
 
02:10:18.669 --> 02:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
you explain what the what the purpose of
 
02:10:20.629 --> 02:10:20.639 align:start position:0%
the moratorium would be then if if it
 
02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't really affect the uh the current
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
contract the systemic effect that that
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
about what what is the panic and what
 
02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
what is the hurry to to put in a
 
02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
moratorium I I would Echo councelor
 
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
Kenny's comments that the importance of
 
02:10:38.669 --> 02:10:38.679 align:start position:0%
a moratorium is to bring the interested
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
parties to the table right now we have a
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
situation developing where there could
 
02:10:45.669 --> 02:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
be a closing could be taking place right
 
02:10:47.950 --> 02:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
now which then has a ripple effect upon
 
02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
the North Country economy and upon the
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
forest products industry generally as of
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
right now we don't know what's happening
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
and to and to Echo councelor Kenny's
 
02:11:01.549 --> 02:11:01.559 align:start position:0%
comments it's important a moratorium in
 
02:11:02.830 --> 02:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
addition to a study committee is
 
02:11:04.990 --> 02:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
important in order to figure out the
 
02:11:07.390 --> 02:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
consequences of that and to bring people
 
02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:09.599 align:start position:0%
to the table so that we can better
 
02:11:11.470 --> 02:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
understand the issue and what the
 
02:11:13.629 --> 02:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
long-term consequences are going to be
 
02:11:14.910 --> 02:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
if any of them need to be addressed
 
02:11:17.229 --> 02:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't but what if they do
 
02:11:19.470 --> 02:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed what are the tools
 
02:11:21.149 --> 02:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
that we have at our at our disposal in
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
order to address
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
them representative Thomas has a
 
02:11:28.069 --> 02:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um you
 
02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
stated that RSA 79 colon 5 is too
 
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
complicated and too cumbersome to use
 
02:11:35.910 --> 02:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
could an adequate approach to this
 
02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
problem be to modify that RSA so that it
 
02:11:42.510 --> 02:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
is not as complicated to use and is more
 
02:11:45.870 --> 02:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
effective short answer yes long answer I
 
02:11:48.750 --> 02:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
don't know how it's going to cause a
 
02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
any change in the Practical effects of
 
02:11:54.109 --> 02:11:54.119 align:start position:0%
litigation in our current judicial
 
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
environment the the the rules that come
 
02:11:58.390 --> 02:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
the rules of court with respect to
 
02:11:59.870 --> 02:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
experts and the standards of proof
 
02:12:03.549 --> 02:12:03.559 align:start position:0%
necessary in order for the town to mount
 
02:12:03.559 --> 02:12:04.830 align:start position:0%
necessary in order for the town to mount
the

02:12:04.830 --> 02:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:07.709 --> 02:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
challenge followup followup so are you
 
02:12:09.990 --> 02:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
saying that every
 
02:12:14.189 --> 02:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
every objection results in
 
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
litigation so the example that just to
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
the example that you gave was it was the
 
02:12:21.149 --> 02:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
council members the the the town elected
 
02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
officials they couldn't go after this
 
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
company without getting I guess you were
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
talking about litigation though correct
 
02:12:30.669 --> 02:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
if if if there's if there's if a town is
 
02:12:32.990 --> 02:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
going to use 795 more likely than not
 
02:12:36.270 --> 02:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:38.549 --> 02:12:38.559 align:start position:0%
appeal and but if we could make that
 
02:12:40.510 --> 02:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
appeal process easier for the towns
 
02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like it's an outdated
 
02:12:46.270 --> 02:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
RSA based on what you said yes okay all
 
02:12:47.629 --> 02:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
right I think I'm all set thank you
 
02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
that's the limit of your questions
 
02:12:53.270 --> 02:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
anyway um seeing no further questions I
 
02:12:54.549 --> 02:12:54.559 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for being here to
 
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:56.719 align:start position:0%

side as a representative uh representing
 
02:13:36.189 --> 02:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
the old District too in Coos which was a
 
02:13:38.669 --> 02:13:38.679 align:start position:0%
huge District that went from Jefferson
 
02:13:40.030 --> 02:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
all the way up to North Stratford over
 
02:13:43.310 --> 02:13:43.320 align:start position:0%

02:13:50.189 --> 02:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
committee and it's good to it's good to
 
02:13:55.229 --> 02:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
be back here and uh so with that said um
 
02:13:56.430 --> 02:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to add a lot of I don't
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
want to add redundancy I will say two
 
02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
things for sure one uh and Mr Hackley is
 
02:14:03.910 --> 02:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
here uh and I will provide to you a
 
02:14:06.149 --> 02:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
letter that we actually sent to him the
 
02:14:08.149 --> 02:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
cost County Commissioners did signed and
 
02:14:10.350 --> 02:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
I believe the legislative uh our
 
02:14:13.430 --> 02:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
delegation did as well uh which was
 
02:14:15.709 --> 02:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
regarding the blue Source Aurora land
 
02:14:18.589 --> 02:14:18.599 align:start position:0%
specifically the easement and
 
02:14:22.270 --> 02:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
in that letter uh it's our understanding
 
02:14:27.390 --> 02:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
that uh that uh Aurora is looking to uh
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
revise the the management plan on the
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
Harvest uh and it's our understanding
 
02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
that that management plan the new
 
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
management plan that they want uh to be
 
02:14:40.629 --> 02:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
approved by Forest and lands is is less
 
02:14:42.430 --> 02:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
than the one that they inherited when
 
02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
they bought the property obviously our
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
position is we do not and I believe
 
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
they're two years into that that I'm
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
sure Mr Hackley knows all the specifics
 
02:14:52.709 --> 02:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
about this far more than me um there's 8
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
years left on it that was my
 
02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
understanding we do not under any
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances right now want a
 
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
management plan uh approved that reduces
 
02:15:06.149 --> 02:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
the Harvest uh you've heard a lot of the
 
02:15:07.870 --> 02:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
the the the testimony because it does
 
02:15:11.109 --> 02:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
directly obviously if it will affect the
 
02:15:13.310 --> 02:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
taxes let me say this though and we say
 
02:15:16.589 --> 02:15:16.599 align:start position:0%
it in the letter this is not just about
 
02:15:21.629 --> 02:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
taxes it's it's not just about that and
 
02:15:23.229 --> 02:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
somebody I couldn't see I was sitting
 
02:15:25.709 --> 02:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
over here somebody said why why do you
 
02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
want this why do you want a moratorium
 
02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
the one thing that I hope is very clear
 
02:15:35.470 --> 02:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
is this is a big issue it's a big issue
 
02:15:37.390 --> 02:15:37.400 align:start position:0%
for the state I think that's what
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
counselor Kenny was articulating it's a
 
02:15:42.669 --> 02:15:42.679 align:start position:0%
huge issue and it's not just about
 
02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
attacks and replacing attacks on a
 
02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
onetoone basis because I would argue
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
with you as a as an econ major from UNH
 
02:15:52.830 --> 02:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
for what it's worth wisby many years ago
 
02:15:55.149 --> 02:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
I would say yeah the onetoone
 
02:15:57.790 --> 02:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
relationship oh no no no no no no if you
 
02:15:59.229 --> 02:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
get rid of the if you get rid of the
 
02:16:00.709 --> 02:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
Timber taxes and you get rid of
 
02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
harvesting and you take Aurora at their
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
word and say we look to reduce 50% plus
 
02:16:10.549 --> 02:16:10.559 align:start position:0%
our portfolio well imagine what you're
 
02:16:12.189 --> 02:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
going to do to the North Country
 
02:16:14.350 --> 02:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
specifically if you reduce the Harvest
 
02:16:15.950 --> 02:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
with what's left of the industry up
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
there and there are people in this room
 
02:16:21.310 --> 02:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
loggers that will tell you you'll if
 
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
we're at a threshold and if you go down
 
02:16:25.390 --> 02:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
to a certain amount then you're going to
 
02:16:27.310 --> 02:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
basically fall inen and purposes
 
02:16:29.950 --> 02:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
collapse collapse the timber industry up
 
02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
there and when you that's an ancillary
 
02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
with what's left of us what we have up
 
02:16:37.429 --> 02:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
there that it it translates and and I'm
 
02:16:38.389 --> 02:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
not I'm not going to get into the
 
02:16:40.110 --> 02:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
specifics of that but it's not a one to
 
02:16:42.429 --> 02:16:42.439 align:start position:0%
one it's not oh we generate you know3
 
02:16:44.750 --> 02:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
million5 million $10 million worth of
 
02:16:46.750 --> 02:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
taxes and we'll just go figure out how
 
02:16:48.549 --> 02:16:48.559 align:start position:0%
we can tax these car credits or this
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
activity somehow for $10 million and
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
then we get it back no because I don't
 
02:16:54.509 --> 02:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
know what the economic analysis would
 
02:16:56.910 --> 02:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
show but I guarante you the proper
 
02:16:58.589 --> 02:16:58.599 align:start position:0%
economic analysis is going to show it's
 
02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
more than just the the tax in the timber
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
because it sustains and supports a whole
 
02:17:05.190 --> 02:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
a whole lifestyle whole
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
ecosystem the uh off-road obviously
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
Recreation uh etc etc what you were
 
02:17:13.709 --> 02:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
talking about here and that's why it's
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
kind of like it's like I'm we're trying
 
02:17:18.030 --> 02:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
to jump up and down and and flat our
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
hands to get the attention is that this
 
02:17:24.030 --> 02:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
is a fundamentally different way to look
 
02:17:27.709 --> 02:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
at our natural resource Forest that's
 
02:17:31.349 --> 02:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
what carbon maximization is and I would
 
02:17:33.469 --> 02:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
urge you
 
02:17:36.309 --> 02:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
that you you can it's it's all there in
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
front of you if you go do some research
 
02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
I wish I could do more for you I would
 
02:17:42.270 --> 02:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
if I could okay because I've been in
 
02:17:44.349 --> 02:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
your position and it's tough to be you
 
02:17:45.870 --> 02:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
you don't have a staff you you don't
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
have people that you know you come up
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
here and and you you have to swat one
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
bill after another and you're dealing
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
with it it's a tough I empathize with
 
02:17:56.669 --> 02:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
you but this issue here is a fundamental
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
issue for the state and it's something
 
02:18:02.589 --> 02:18:02.599 align:start position:0%
that you have three legislative Vehicles
 
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
this session you have this one here and
 
02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly mentioned his two
 
02:18:10.509 --> 02:18:10.519 align:start position:0%
others so this legislature and certainly
 
02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
this Republican leadership but this is a
 
02:18:15.469 --> 02:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
bipartisan issue from us sitting on this
 
02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
side up in Coos County it's all bipar
 
02:18:20.830 --> 02:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
but I will tell you this legislature
 
02:18:23.309 --> 02:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
needs to do something about it and why
 
02:18:26.549 --> 02:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
the moratorium the moratorium because I
 
02:18:29.309 --> 02:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
think councelor Kenny is absolutely
 
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
correct it will it will bring people out
 
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
but I want to put another wrinkle on it
 
02:18:36.910 --> 02:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
I came home to become the County
 
02:18:39.549 --> 02:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
Administrator last May May 15th I've
 
02:18:41.629 --> 02:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
been down in Louisiana off and on for 14
 
02:18:43.549 --> 02:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
years lived down there for 14 years I
 
02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
was Bobby Jing's Deputy Commissioner of
 
02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
administration which which is his
 
02:18:50.429 --> 02:18:50.439 align:start position:0%
turbocharged om uh actually did the
 
02:18:52.589 --> 02:18:52.599 align:start position:0%
whole BP oil spill with him took care of
 
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
his interest along with Garrett Graves
 
02:18:56.070 --> 02:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
who's now in Congress we got a lot of
 
02:18:57.950 --> 02:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
money out of BP on that too and they
 
02:18:59.950 --> 02:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
deserve to have the money be taken from
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
with what they did okay but also my last
 
02:19:06.309 --> 02:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
tenure was the last three years as the
 
02:19:07.870 --> 02:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
under secretary for the Department of
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
Natural Resources in
 
02:19:13.349 --> 02:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
Louisiana Louisiana was just so I worked
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
on a lot of this stuff I've worked on
 
02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
carbon capture and sequest ation not
 
02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
from forest but from injection where
 
02:19:22.990 --> 02:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
they capture at the source and then
 
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
Louisiana geologically is is is is very
 
02:19:28.309 --> 02:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
good to be able to inject it very
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
controversial and what I would say to
 
02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
you is and I'll I'll end it what I would
 
02:19:37.469 --> 02:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
say to you is that this is this is this
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
is Big Money big big billions and
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars money this is big
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
hedge funds Sovereign wealth funds that
 
02:19:47.950 --> 02:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
are in this
 
02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
and to be blunt they really don't care
 
02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
about us up north our lifestyle it's
 
02:19:57.150 --> 02:19:57.160 align:start position:0%
about aggregation of forest globally to
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
generate their numbers and they're very
 
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
smart people thank you thank you
 
02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate those forceful
 
02:20:08.550 --> 02:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
comments questions for Mr Brady
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
02:20:13.630 --> 02:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
um I just need a a little bit of
 
02:20:15.750 --> 02:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
clarification one of the previous
 
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
speakers talked about a person of
 
02:20:20.190 --> 02:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
property a personal um privately owned
 
02:20:22.429 --> 02:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
parcel of property Somebody Loved
 
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
bunnies and so they they didn't cut down
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
trees they but they allowed public and
 
02:20:29.469 --> 02:20:29.479 align:start position:0%
everything but then that changes to this
 
02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
corporation that has large Parcels
 
02:20:34.309 --> 02:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
what's the cut off is there a cut off
 
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
you're talking about that's a really
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
good question because I think that gets
 
02:20:42.750 --> 02:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
to one of the hearts of this issue um
 
02:20:46.750 --> 02:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
look as attorney felle said uh this is
 
02:20:49.830 --> 02:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
all about property rights uh you know I
 
02:20:52.429 --> 02:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
think Mr L is in here he gave a very
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
good presentation actually but if you go
 
02:20:56.950 --> 02:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
to his website his business plan he
 
02:21:00.110 --> 02:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
markets himself 2,000 acres or more and
 
02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
he can help you generate carbon credits
 
02:21:03.670 --> 02:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's what I think's on its website I
 
02:21:04.750 --> 02:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
went and looked at
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
it what I say am I qualified to say what
 
02:21:09.670 --> 02:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
that number is no I think that's a
 
02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
discussion to be had I I don't want you
 
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
to lose sight of the fact that this
 
02:21:17.309 --> 02:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
really is not about small private
 
02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
property owners and it's not about
 
02:21:19.870 --> 02:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
telling them what they can and what they
 
02:21:22.349 --> 02:21:22.359 align:start position:0%
can't do I think the state needs to
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
understand the credit carbon market and
 
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
I've got right here I can leave it with
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
you here's California's air and Resource
 
02:21:32.670 --> 02:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
Board this is it this is a scoping plan
 
02:21:34.670 --> 02:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
you want to know cap and trade this is
 
02:21:37.550 --> 02:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
what is here in New Hampshire right now
 
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
I think you the legislature and the
 
02:21:42.389 --> 02:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
state needs to know that but what's that
 
02:21:43.710 --> 02:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
threshold I think it's something that
 
02:21:47.070 --> 02:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be to be flushed out but there
 
02:21:50.830 --> 02:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
is is a distinction there's a very valid
 
02:21:54.309 --> 02:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
distinction additional
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none let's move along
 
02:21:58.510 --> 02:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for being here both
 
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
of you gentlemen that was a pretty good
 
02:22:05.469 --> 02:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
segue to the next speaker who is Patrick
 
02:22:08.309 --> 02:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
Hackley from the division of forest and
 
02:22:10.910 --> 02:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
lands Mr Hackley
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:34.230 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

02:22:34.230 --> 02:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:35.990 --> 02:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I'll be a good segue to
 
02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
that because that was some passionate
 
02:22:40.750 --> 02:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
testimony there um thank you for the
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify this morning
 
02:22:45.389 --> 02:22:45.399 align:start position:0%
chairman Bose and members of the
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
02:22:49.630 --> 02:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think my testimony before you
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
this morning is going to cover too much
 
02:22:52.670 --> 02:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
of the same ground and I'll be I'm going
 
02:22:55.190 --> 02:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
to read from my testimony quickly
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
because I know we have a lot of ground
 
02:22:59.429 --> 02:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
to cover still um the Department of
 
02:23:01.070 --> 02:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
Natural and cultural resources division
 
02:23:03.429 --> 02:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
of forest and lands we do not take a
 
02:23:05.349 --> 02:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
position on this bill as written but we
 
02:23:06.910 --> 02:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
do have a few
 
02:23:09.110 --> 02:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
concerns um just for some background by
 
02:23:10.910 --> 02:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
the way my name is Patrick Hackley I'm
 
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
the state Forester and the director for
 
02:23:14.990 --> 02:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
the division of forest and lands we're
 
02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
under the Department of Natural and
 
02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:17.870 align:start position:0%
under the Department of Natural and
cultural

02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
cultural
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
resources um we're the state agency
 
02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
charged with the execution of all
 
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
matters pertaining to forestry Forest
 
02:23:25.710 --> 02:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
management and Forest lands within the
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the state one of our key
 
02:23:29.750 --> 02:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is to protect our
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
natural resources for the benefit of
 
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
State citizens visitors and the forest
 
02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:35.590 align:start position:0%
State citizens visitors and the forest
products

02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
products
 
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
industry uh as we all know the we all
 
02:23:40.429 --> 02:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
understand the Bill's intent here this
 
02:23:41.950 --> 02:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
this morning is to suspend the
 
02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
participation of all land owners in
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
carbon credit programs such as the
 
02:23:48.030 --> 02:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
California car carbon emissions cap and
 
02:23:50.750 --> 02:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
trade offset program which is perceived
 
02:23:52.990 --> 02:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
to diminish Timber tax revenue decrease
 
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
Forest employment and reduce wood supply
 
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
to local
 
02:23:59.630 --> 02:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
Mills however one exceptional case
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
between the town of Pittsburgh and the
 
02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
state's largest private Forest land
 
02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
owner who has decided to increase their
 
02:24:07.550 --> 02:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
sale of carbon credits rather than
 
02:24:09.469 --> 02:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
Harvest Timber well they're still
 
02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
harvesting Timber but on a much more
 
02:24:13.870 --> 02:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
diminished level is not a compelling
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
reason to restrict all land owners in
 
02:24:18.429 --> 02:24:18.439 align:start position:0%
the state from their right to enroll
 
02:24:20.230 --> 02:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
their property in such a
 
02:24:23.389 --> 02:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
program a few other observations I'll
 
02:24:26.429 --> 02:24:26.439 align:start position:0%
again trying to stay brief um for your
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
consideration the Department of Natural
 
02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
and cultural resources does not have the
 
02:24:33.309 --> 02:24:33.319 align:start position:0%
authority we do not have the statutory
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
authority to restrict a landowner's
 
02:24:37.230 --> 02:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
right to manage their forest for any
 
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
such use or any use if such management
 
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
is in accordance with all state local
 
02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
and federal
 
02:24:46.429 --> 02:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
laws fair and reasonable land use
 
02:24:48.030 --> 02:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
regulation and the availability of
 
02:24:50.190 --> 02:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
alternate Revenue sources encourages
 
02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
land owners to keep their Forest as
 
02:24:55.870 --> 02:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
forests which benefits the larger public
 
02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
interest at this stage it's too early to
 
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
determine as we heard from Mr LC how
 
02:25:02.510 --> 02:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
many land owners Statewide are enrolling
 
02:25:04.110 --> 02:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
or will enroll in the carbon credit
 
02:25:07.150 --> 02:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
programs and what those impacts will be
 
02:25:09.309 --> 02:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
I do understand what Mr felle was saying
 
02:25:09.319 --> 02:25:10.230 align:start position:0%
I do understand what Mr felle was saying
about

02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:25:13.710 --> 02:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
systemic uh um Fallout should more and
 
02:25:15.550 --> 02:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
more land owners enroll in such programs
 
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
we we simply do not know that right now
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
so to impose a moratorium on all
 
02:25:21.710 --> 02:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
landowners across the state is something
 
02:25:25.269 --> 02:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
that um I think is a is a real concern
 
02:25:26.910 --> 02:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
prematurely suspending land owners from
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
participating in such programs is not
 
02:25:30.750 --> 02:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
within our Authority as I mentioned and
 
02:25:33.710 --> 02:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
even if it were legal to restrict this
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
right such a law may lead to unintended
 
02:25:39.550 --> 02:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
outcomes possibly um over a two-year
 
02:25:41.429 --> 02:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
period some Landers might say why don't
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
I just do something else with my land
 
02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
that's not forested to to derive a
 
02:25:46.469 --> 02:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
revenue Source if the state's going to
 
02:25:48.190 --> 02:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
restrict on carbon credits what else can
 
02:25:50.349 --> 02:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
they restrict me on so there's a concern
 
02:25:51.630 --> 02:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
there that we have for private land
 
02:25:55.830 --> 02:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
owners and the private Forest of New
 
02:25:58.469 --> 02:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and finally I'll I'll frame my
 
02:26:01.070 --> 02:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
my um my final point and then just a
 
02:26:03.630 --> 02:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
personal observation the situation in
 
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh between Aurora formerly blue
 
02:26:08.590 --> 02:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
source that inspired this bill is still
 
02:26:10.710 --> 02:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
unresolved under the terms of the state
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
held conservation easement the landowner
 
02:26:14.190 --> 02:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
must submit their 10-year Forest
 
02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
management plan to our agency for review
 
02:26:19.269 --> 02:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
an approval although the land owner has
 
02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
indicated that they intend to drop the
 
02:26:22.510 --> 02:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
Harvest to half the volume of previous
 
02:26:25.790 --> 02:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
years as again as the the graphic that
 
02:26:28.590 --> 02:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
Mr L showed earlier uh they intend to
 
02:26:31.309 --> 02:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
drop their volume in half uh compared to
 
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
previous years in favor of carbon credit
 
02:26:35.630 --> 02:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
generation the State has yet to approve
 
02:26:37.950 --> 02:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
their new revised plan to the and
 
02:26:39.630 --> 02:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
compare that to the purposes of why that
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
easement was created U and placed on the
 
02:26:45.950 --> 02:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
property and just I want to make a final
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
comment to those who may not know my
 
02:26:50.389 --> 02:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
background um I want to address the
 
02:26:51.870 --> 02:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
committee but also those who are in
 
02:26:53.950 --> 02:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
attendants who support this bill please
 
02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
be patient with the process as we review
 
02:26:58.230 --> 02:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
the landowner's new management plan and
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
be assured that we are taking your
 
02:27:02.150 --> 02:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
concerns and that of all stakeholders in
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
this issue very
 
02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
seriously I began my long forestry
 
02:27:07.950 --> 02:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
career in West Stewartstown over 35
 
02:27:10.429 --> 02:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
years ago managing the same tract of
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
land the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters
 
02:27:14.429 --> 02:27:14.439 align:start position:0%
and North Country Forest are ingrained
 
02:27:17.469 --> 02:27:17.479 align:start position:0%
in who I am as a Forester
 
02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm in this position I
 
02:27:19.870 --> 02:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
think it's part of the reason why I'm in
 
02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
the position of State Forester today so
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
please know that I will do everything in
 
02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
my part working with the other state
 
02:27:27.710 --> 02:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
agencies to ensure that the letter and
 
02:27:29.469 --> 02:27:29.479 align:start position:0%
intent of this conservation easement is
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
upheld thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
speak this morning thank you Mr Hackley
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being
 
02:27:38.710 --> 02:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
here I have a couple of questions did I
 
02:27:41.230 --> 02:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
understand you to say that a moratorium
 
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
could potentially lead to even more
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
development of forest lands by by owners
 
02:27:49.950 --> 02:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
who say well if I can't sell car carbon
 
02:27:52.150 --> 02:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
credits maybe I'll sell
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
houses in a two-year window it might be
 
02:27:56.670 --> 02:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
considered a stretch chair Vos but what
 
02:27:58.590 --> 02:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get at is that if we
 
02:28:00.990 --> 02:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
restrict land owners ability to do what
 
02:28:02.349 --> 02:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
they wish with their land as long as
 
02:28:06.630 --> 02:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
it's a legal use then it's one more you
 
02:28:09.349 --> 02:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
know one more detraction to owning man
 
02:28:11.070 --> 02:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
owning and managing Forest
 
02:28:15.070 --> 02:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
land okay my more um serious question
 
02:28:17.870 --> 02:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
here is about
 
02:28:20.830 --> 02:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
the statement in your written testimony
 
02:28:23.389 --> 02:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
that says the State has yet to approve
 
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
that plan relative to the purposes of
 
02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
the easement what are the conditions
 
02:28:32.230 --> 02:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
under which the state is evaluating that
 
02:28:35.070 --> 02:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
plan right for approval thank you for
 
02:28:38.110 --> 02:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
the question um so it's a very lengthy
 
02:28:39.389 --> 02:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
document I don't know how many of you
 
02:28:41.269 --> 02:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
have had a chance to review it but it's
 
02:28:42.910 --> 02:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
one of the more complicated conservation
 
02:28:44.830 --> 02:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
easements that are held on private land
 
02:28:46.990 --> 02:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire but the
 
02:28:49.510 --> 02:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
purposes and intent of a conservation
 
02:28:51.429 --> 02:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
easement were to protect this land from
 
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
development number one so it would not
 
02:28:55.150 --> 02:28:55.160 align:start position:0%
be developed okay that's usually the
 
02:28:58.190 --> 02:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
intent of most almost all conservation
 
02:29:00.750 --> 02:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
easements but secondly was to maintain
 
02:29:02.309 --> 02:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
the land to keep it open for
 
02:29:04.950 --> 02:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
recreational interests and that is why
 
02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
the state when they negotiated the sale
 
02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
of this when when the property was being
 
02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
sold um that the state acquired 250 260
 
02:29:17.590 --> 02:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
mies of gravel roads that that
 
02:29:20.349 --> 02:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
um interlace this property so the state
 
02:29:21.790 --> 02:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
owns the majority of the roads and
 
02:29:23.830 --> 02:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's really a large part of how we
 
02:29:25.550 --> 02:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
control the recreational access to the
 
02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
land so recreational access was a key
 
02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
provision the production of Forest
 
02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
Products traditional forestry is also
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
one of the purposes of the easement and
 
02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's really the Crux of what we're
 
02:29:39.150 --> 02:29:39.160 align:start position:0%
getting at today there are no specific
 
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
metrics in the easement that say thou
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
shalt cut so many cords per year and
 
02:29:45.389 --> 02:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
that and there in lies some of the the
 
02:29:47.309 --> 02:29:47.319 align:start position:0%
rub here because of the the ambiguity of
 
02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
the easement but it has purposes so
 
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
recreational access uh maintenance of
 
02:29:56.070 --> 02:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
wildlife habitat and water quality um
 
02:29:57.670 --> 02:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
continuation of traditional Forest
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
Products use again as was mentioned
 
02:30:01.349 --> 02:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
before no one conceived of carbon
 
02:30:02.750 --> 02:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
credits and that this would be a revenue
 
02:30:05.150 --> 02:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
source for the land owner 20 years ago
 
02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
so now that's why we're grappling with
 
02:30:09.309 --> 02:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
it now but we see this as a balancing
 
02:30:11.790 --> 02:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
act between the land owners's rights and
 
02:30:13.710 --> 02:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
the Public's interests that are being
 
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
protected by the easement and that's
 
02:30:17.550 --> 02:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
that's the challenge before us as state
 
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
agencies is to weigh how much of can we
 
02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
find a can we find a a resolution
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
between those two um two parties and uh
 
02:30:30.389 --> 02:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
a balance of interest that these lands
 
02:30:33.309 --> 02:30:33.319 align:start position:0%
provide excellent answer thank you
 
02:30:35.230 --> 02:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
further questions for Mr Hackley
 
02:30:38.429 --> 02:30:38.439 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
02:30:40.990 --> 02:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
um when an two parts when analyzing
 
02:30:42.630 --> 02:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
these plans first of all do you have a
 
02:30:45.309 --> 02:30:45.319 align:start position:0%
time uh frame for this one to be
 
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
analyzed and secondly when you do
 
02:30:50.030 --> 02:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
analyze do you include public benefit
 
02:30:52.670 --> 02:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
and Community impact in your analysis
 
02:30:56.469 --> 02:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you excellent question
 
02:30:59.870 --> 02:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
um so we have 90 days to respond and
 
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
that clock begins ticking as of last
 
02:31:05.230 --> 02:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
Friday we received a revised uh what is
 
02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
called a 10-year Forest stewardship plan
 
02:31:10.429 --> 02:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
so the clock ticks now for the state to
 
02:31:12.150 --> 02:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
review and respond back to the land
 
02:31:14.190 --> 02:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
owner and what was your second question
 
02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry um when you're anal when
 
02:31:17.990 --> 02:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
you're analyzing these plans do you
 
02:31:20.230 --> 02:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
include public benefit and Community
 
02:31:23.429 --> 02:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
impact we absolutely will be doing that
 
02:31:25.630 --> 02:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
that is articulated in the purposes
 
02:31:27.309 --> 02:31:27.319 align:start position:0%
section of the
 
02:31:27.319 --> 02:31:29.269 align:start position:0%
section of the
easement

02:31:29.269 --> 02:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
easement
 
02:31:31.830 --> 02:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
yeah representative parall has a
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair B and thank you
 
02:31:34.990 --> 02:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
for your
 
02:31:38.269 --> 02:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
testimony um I would
 
02:31:40.990 --> 02:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
assume and and correct me if I'm wrong
 
02:31:42.309 --> 02:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
but there's been some talk about a
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
registry uh for New Hampshire to find
 
02:31:45.670 --> 02:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
out who's actually engaging this
 
02:31:48.030 --> 02:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
activity would the uh creation of that
 
02:31:51.550 --> 02:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:54.429 --> 02:31:54.439 align:start position:0%
department it's a good question um it's
 
02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
all part of the the overall discussion
 
02:31:58.110 --> 02:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
um we have talked with some of the
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
legislators from the North Country about
 
02:32:01.389 --> 02:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
the value of a registry so we know what
 
02:32:03.550 --> 02:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
land owners are participating or intend
 
02:32:05.070 --> 02:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
to participate so I don't know if our
 
02:32:08.870 --> 02:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
agency would be the one um we do have um
 
02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
to keep track of uh Timber harvest in
 
02:32:12.550 --> 02:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
the state we do have a a portable it
 
02:32:14.910 --> 02:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
sounds a little odd and and um detailed
 
02:32:16.750 --> 02:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
but we have a portable sawmill Reg indry
 
02:32:17.910 --> 02:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
all all people that have portable
 
02:32:20.269 --> 02:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
sawmills register with our division uh
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that's just to keep track of the
 
02:32:23.710 --> 02:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
non-commercial production of lumber so I
 
02:32:25.510 --> 02:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
mean there's a means there's a vehicle
 
02:32:27.469 --> 02:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
to do it whether we're the one or Dr is
 
02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
the one I don't know uh followup
 
02:32:32.670 --> 02:32:32.680 align:start position:0%
followup yes uh would you uh if it were
 
02:32:34.150 --> 02:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
you would you need an increase in
 
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
Staffing in order to do engage in such
 
02:32:39.429 --> 02:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
work and also uh could this information
 
02:32:41.950 --> 02:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
be found within the domain of our
 
02:32:44.550 --> 02:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
national Registries or or do we need to
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
have something done specific spefic to
 
02:32:49.710 --> 02:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in order to create this
 
02:32:52.469 --> 02:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
registry uh first question I'd have to
 
02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
give it some more thought as far as data
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
collection I don't think it's going to
 
02:32:56.950 --> 02:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
be a significant amount of land owners
 
02:32:58.670 --> 02:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
currently so I think within the
 
02:33:00.950 --> 02:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
bandwidth of our state resources I think
 
02:33:03.429 --> 02:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
we could do it um I don't want to commit
 
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
to that until I consult my staff but I
 
02:33:07.389 --> 02:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
think we could pull that off and as far
 
02:33:10.870 --> 02:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
as your second question about um if
 
02:33:12.590 --> 02:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
there's in if there's another source of
 
02:33:14.110 --> 02:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
this information besides having to go
 
02:33:16.910 --> 02:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
through registry I doubt it I think it's
 
02:33:18.510 --> 02:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much the wild west still when it
 
02:33:20.910 --> 02:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
comes to what land owners are enrolling
 
02:33:24.030 --> 02:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
with representative McGee has a question
 
02:33:28.670 --> 02:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
02:33:31.349 --> 02:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
heckley for taking my question um I've
 
02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
had several conversations with folks uh
 
02:33:37.150 --> 02:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
about this bill including um the New
 
02:33:38.790 --> 02:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Society for the protection of
 
02:33:41.790 --> 02:33:41.800 align:start position:0%
forests and we continually hear people
 
02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
talk about it in terms of its emphasis
 
02:33:46.950 --> 02:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
on property rights who can do what with
 
02:33:49.349 --> 02:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
the land that they purchase but I'd like
 
02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
you to comment on how much of um the
 
02:33:56.429 --> 02:33:56.439 align:start position:0%
essence of the efforts here seem to be
 
02:33:58.269 --> 02:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
focused on how we're managing our
 
02:34:01.389 --> 02:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
resources in terms of a lot of the land
 
02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
may be under downward pressure just
 
02:34:04.870 --> 02:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
because of the value of the resources
 
02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
right whether it's the water the land
 
02:34:10.950 --> 02:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
the wood carbon sequestration so the
 
02:34:13.550 --> 02:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
value of our natural resources is
 
02:34:14.670 --> 02:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
something that's going
 
02:34:17.550 --> 02:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
to be causing it to be carved up in
 
02:34:18.670 --> 02:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
different ways right they're going to be
 
02:34:20.830 --> 02:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
people who are looking to make money who
 
02:34:22.750 --> 02:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
say the Northeast is a good place for us
 
02:34:25.710 --> 02:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
to go buy large tracks of land so my
 
02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:26.590 align:start position:0%
to go buy large tracks of land so my
question

02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:34:29.750 --> 02:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
is do you have any sense of what the
 
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
state's obligation is or whether there
 
02:34:34.670 --> 02:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
is a changing obligation in terms of
 
02:34:37.269 --> 02:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
prote protecting the natural resources
 
02:34:38.510 --> 02:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
that are being bought by private
 
02:34:41.590 --> 02:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
entities for the benefit of the citizens
 
02:34:43.269 --> 02:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
who live here because I think that's
 
02:34:45.710 --> 02:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
kind of the Crux of the problem we're
 
02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:46.630 align:start position:0%
kind of the Crux of the problem we're
facing

02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
facing
 
02:34:48.030 --> 02:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's our industries that are
 
02:34:50.309 --> 02:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
suffering or whether it's our lands that
 
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
are being mismanaged by people from
 
02:34:54.910 --> 02:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
outside who don't have the same caring
 
02:34:57.429 --> 02:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
for the land I I I look at it as a
 
02:34:59.910 --> 02:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
resource issue rather than a property
 
02:35:02.269 --> 02:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
rights issue and I I just wonder if you
 
02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
could comment on it from the perch that
 
02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
you have from this
 
02:35:09.870 --> 02:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
agency wow that's a really good question
 
02:35:12.790 --> 02:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll try to Grapple it with with
 
02:35:17.429 --> 02:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
as quick amount of time as possible um
 
02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
so new H is in pretty good shape by as
 
02:35:22.429 --> 02:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
we've heard today it's 82% forested it's
 
02:35:25.790 --> 02:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
its land mass is 82% forested we we
 
02:35:27.630 --> 02:35:27.640 align:start position:0%
collectively whether deliberately or by
 
02:35:29.269 --> 02:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
accident have done a very very good job
 
02:35:31.710 --> 02:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
of keeping our forests intact and keep
 
02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
in mind also that 70% plus SE More than
 
02:35:39.150 --> 02:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
70% is privately owned as you know
 
02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
um about 34% is under conservation of
 
02:35:45.190 --> 02:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
some kind or another 34% of those
 
02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
forests that's that includes the White
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
Mountain National Forest all the state
 
02:35:53.070 --> 02:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
land uh land use uh Land Trust Etc so
 
02:35:55.309 --> 02:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
we're well above 30% conserved meaning
 
02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
no development on those Acres that's
 
02:35:59.910 --> 02:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
also a good thing when we get into the
 
02:36:04.429 --> 02:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
discussion of land property rights and
 
02:36:06.030 --> 02:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
concern about our forest we have to be
 
02:36:09.070 --> 02:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
careful when we say our forest because
 
02:36:10.550 --> 02:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
we have public forest and we have
 
02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
private Forest but when you have a
 
02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
forest land owner that owns large tracks
 
02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:14.910 align:start position:0%
forest land owner that owns large tracks
of

02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:36:18.349 --> 02:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
land 5,000 10,000 and in the case that's
 
02:36:20.469 --> 02:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
inspired this bill
 
02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
146,000 we start getting into the
 
02:36:25.790 --> 02:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
discussion of public interests public
 
02:36:27.870 --> 02:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
benefits that large tracks of land
 
02:36:30.429 --> 02:36:30.439 align:start position:0%
provide so that's where the dance begins
 
02:36:31.590 --> 02:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
with the private land owner and there
 
02:36:33.870 --> 02:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be a a mutual agreement as to
 
02:36:35.230 --> 02:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to protect and what
 
02:36:38.670 --> 02:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
the land owner is willing to agree to do
 
02:36:41.230 --> 02:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
for that let's say social license to
 
02:36:44.469 --> 02:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
practice forestry um Recreation is a
 
02:36:46.389 --> 02:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
huge concern for the North country that
 
02:36:48.030 --> 02:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
is basically one of their economic
 
02:36:49.950 --> 02:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
engines more so in some cases than the
 
02:36:52.510 --> 02:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
forest products industry used to be so
 
02:36:55.030 --> 02:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
when you get into large tracks of land
 
02:36:58.070 --> 02:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
the public interest concerns goes up
 
02:36:59.790 --> 02:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
proportionally and that's where the
 
02:37:01.950 --> 02:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
state does and that's why we that's why
 
02:37:04.710 --> 02:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
the state invested 20 years ago in in
 
02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
purchasing the easement with certain
 
02:37:08.590 --> 02:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
Protections in it that every landowner
 
02:37:09.910 --> 02:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
afterwards that buys that land the
 
02:37:11.469 --> 02:37:11.479 align:start position:0%
easement runs with the property to
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
protect those values
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that answers your
 
02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
question but that's kind of how I'm
 
02:37:20.349 --> 02:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
looking at it from
 
02:37:24.030 --> 02:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
now yeah I'd like to move on if we could
 
02:37:26.910 --> 02:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh I appreciate you being here director
 
02:37:29.230 --> 02:37:29.240 align:start position:0%

will disclose today is that I I am a
 
02:38:28.190 --> 02:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
member of the current use Advisory
 
02:38:30.990 --> 02:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
Board I'm here today to testify an
 
02:38:33.269 --> 02:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
opposition of House Bill
 
02:38:36.070 --> 02:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
1697 and the proposed amendment seeking
 
02:38:38.830 --> 02:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
a 2-year moratorium that would exclude
 
02:38:41.590 --> 02:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
all private Forest land owners in New
 
02:38:44.070 --> 02:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from entering into a contract
 
02:38:46.990 --> 02:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
to sell carbon credits on their private
 
02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
Forest lands we all know House Bill 697
 
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
is proposed because of one large Forest
 
02:38:57.510 --> 02:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
land owner who owns the Connecticut Lake
 
02:39:00.030 --> 02:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
Headwaters in Northern New Hampshire who
 
02:39:02.030 --> 02:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
signed up for carbon credits while
 
02:39:04.309 --> 02:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
cutting back on harvesting Timber
 
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
Products this is a unique property with
 
02:39:09.510 --> 02:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
a state heeld conservation easement on
 
02:39:12.349 --> 02:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
it it is not representative of the
 
02:39:14.590 --> 02:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
thousands of private Forest land owners
 
02:39:16.429 --> 02:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
02:39:18.670 --> 02:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
I would question if this bill is even
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
legal say nothing about how upset
 
02:39:23.790 --> 02:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
private Forest landowners would be in
 
02:39:26.630 --> 02:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
our Live Free or Die state if they were
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
told they could not enter into a
 
02:39:31.910 --> 02:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
contract of carbon credits or any other
 
02:39:36.110 --> 02:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
contracts on their own land as a forest
 
02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
land owner who owns 2400 acres in New
 
02:39:42.309 --> 02:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and has freely shared our land
 
02:39:45.349 --> 02:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
over 68 years to the state of New
 
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the general public I would
 
02:39:49.990 --> 02:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
have to reconsider whether we wanted to
 
02:39:53.309 --> 02:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
continue sharing our land if House Bill
 
02:39:56.910 --> 02:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
1697 were to pass my question to the
 
02:39:59.670 --> 02:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
committee is if this bill were to
 
02:40:02.269 --> 02:40:02.279 align:start position:0%
pass would you freeze the payments of
 
02:40:04.309 --> 02:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
the carbon credits of the two for two
 
02:40:06.510 --> 02:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
years with this small number of forest
 
02:40:09.150 --> 02:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
land owners who have already entered
 
02:40:11.950 --> 02:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
into a 20 or 40 or 100e
 
02:40:15.550 --> 02:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
contract I encourage the chairman the
 
02:40:17.750 --> 02:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee to do the right thing for the
 
02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
thousands of small and large New
 
02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire land owners and kill this Bill
 
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and I'm happy to
 
02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions thank you Mr
 
02:40:29.469 --> 02:40:29.479 align:start position:0%
Thompson representative Corman has a
 
02:40:31.070 --> 02:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you Mr chairman
 
02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Thompson for taking my
 
02:40:34.230 --> 02:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
question I'm one of your neighbors I
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
represent Lebanon yes sir good to meet
 
02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
you um the amendment that we're looking
 
02:40:42.590 --> 02:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
at says that the department shall
 
02:40:44.670 --> 02:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
suspend the sale of carbon credits and
 
02:40:46.150 --> 02:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
offsets from the Woodlands of New
 
02:40:47.550 --> 02:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for two years from the
 
02:40:51.790 --> 02:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
effective date of this act so as it
 
02:40:53.590 --> 02:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
we've been told the way to interpret it
 
02:40:56.309 --> 02:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
is it new sales of carbon credits would
 
02:40:59.269 --> 02:40:59.279 align:start position:0%
be suspended rather than saying that
 
02:41:01.870 --> 02:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
existing contracts would be affected in
 
02:41:03.950 --> 02:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
light of that do you still oppose the
 
02:41:07.190 --> 02:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:10.269 --> 02:41:10.279 align:start position:0%
sir representative licki has a question
 
02:41:11.630 --> 02:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:41:14.309 --> 02:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question and this um I keep
 
02:41:16.269 --> 02:41:16.279 align:start position:0%
coming back to the uh
 
02:41:18.910 --> 02:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
current use which you apparently are
 
02:41:21.429 --> 02:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
know quite a lot about but basically in
 
02:41:23.710 --> 02:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
my mind current use is a deal we give
 
02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
you a tax break because you provide a
 
02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
benefit to the state to the towns
 
02:41:31.269 --> 02:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
whatever um and if the benefit that you
 
02:41:33.070 --> 02:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
provide is diminished then should not
 
02:41:36.429 --> 02:41:36.439 align:start position:0%
your current use uh percentage uh taxes
 
02:41:38.590 --> 02:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
go up so because you are not providing
 
02:41:41.230 --> 02:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
that benefit anymore well first of all
 
02:41:42.309 --> 02:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh the current
 
02:41:46.469 --> 02:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
use was uh developed in 19 19 or started
 
02:41:49.309 --> 02:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
in 1968 it took about 5 years because it
 
02:41:52.150 --> 02:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
was a con Constitutional Amendment and
 
02:41:54.990 --> 02:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of that back then was
 
02:41:57.590 --> 02:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
because we saw what was happening in the
 
02:41:59.950 --> 02:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state where
 
02:42:03.790 --> 02:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
development was Farmland was being used
 
02:42:06.830 --> 02:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
for development forestry was being used
 
02:42:09.830 --> 02:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
and it and it uh as we all know going
 
02:42:11.830 --> 02:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
through the con trying to change the
 
02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution is a pretty high bar to get
 
02:42:18.750 --> 02:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
under but it happened and um in current
 
02:42:22.389 --> 02:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
use you're assessing the land for what
 
02:42:23.349 --> 02:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
it can
 
02:42:27.590 --> 02:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
grow you indicated that it's a tax
 
02:42:30.870 --> 02:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
um abatement more or less to landowners
 
02:42:33.150 --> 02:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
it's not what it was it went through the
 
02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:34.389 align:start position:0%
it's not what it was it went through the
Constitutional

02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
Constitutional
 
02:42:38.230 --> 02:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
amendment was voted on by the people and
 
02:42:41.710 --> 02:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
whether it's my farm land or if it's my
 
02:42:45.510 --> 02:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
forestry it's assessed at what it can is
 
02:42:46.910 --> 02:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
capable of
 
02:42:49.750 --> 02:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
growing and
 
02:42:52.910 --> 02:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I think there there's been some some
 
02:42:54.750 --> 02:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
comments made about current use that I
 
02:42:58.429 --> 02:42:58.439 align:start position:0%
think that uh anyone here or in the
 
02:43:00.429 --> 02:43:00.439 align:start position:0%
audience can go to the Department of
 
02:43:02.030 --> 02:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration which we're
 
02:43:05.190 --> 02:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
attached to and it's and look it up on
 
02:43:06.990 --> 02:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
the website there's a handbook that
 
02:43:09.670 --> 02:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
gives all of the rules and regulations
 
02:43:11.950 --> 02:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be a might be good
 
02:43:13.510 --> 02:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
if everyone did
 
02:43:16.030 --> 02:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
that good suggestion thank you do you
 
02:43:18.910 --> 02:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
need a followup
 
02:43:21.550 --> 02:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
no okay seeing no further questions for
 
02:43:22.990 --> 02:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Thompson I want to thank you for
 
02:43:25.710 --> 02:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
coming up today and call on Steven Wood
 
02:43:28.750 --> 02:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
thank you of Lebanon who may be one of
 
02:43:32.670 --> 02:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:34.950 --> 02:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
constituents hello I'm Stephen wood from

constituents and I've known him for a
 
02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
long time um I own uh about a th000
 
02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
acres of land in Lebanon in planfield
 
02:43:48.309 --> 02:43:48.319 align:start position:0%

Dublin um and our land has been in
 
02:43:54.950 --> 02:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
current use forever not that that's
 
02:43:58.510 --> 02:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
gerain to this bill I am I'm sorry I am
 
02:44:03.349 --> 02:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
here I'll pull it right over oh um I am

02:44:06.429 --> 02:44:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:09.870 --> 02:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
in turned it off it off you know maybe
 
02:44:11.950 --> 02:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
somebody's talking to me
 
02:44:15.269 --> 02:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
here I I am here in vigorous resp
 
02:44:18.110 --> 02:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
respectful opposition to this bill I've
 
02:44:21.110 --> 02:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
I've seen an amendment and heard what Mr
 
02:44:22.670 --> 02:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
Corman just read it doesn't change my
 
02:44:23.790 --> 02:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
view a
 
02:44:28.030 --> 02:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
WI a a moratorium is an inappropriate in
 
02:44:31.349 --> 02:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way to do what you are
 
02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
many of you write we must do which is to
 
02:44:36.750 --> 02:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
know more about this entire carbon
 
02:44:40.910 --> 02:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
sequestration Market as do you have an
 
02:44:43.469 --> 02:44:43.479 align:start position:0%
interest in this we have an interest in
 
02:44:46.269 --> 02:44:46.279 align:start position:0%
this as well people have spoken about
 
02:44:48.830 --> 02:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
the program there is no State program
 
02:44:50.630 --> 02:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
the only program that they're you're
 
02:44:53.750 --> 02:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
really kind of being pushed to consider
 
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
is the one in Connecticut
 
02:44:59.830 --> 02:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
Lakes American uh Forest Foundation who
 
02:45:03.469 --> 02:45:03.479 align:start position:0%
are The Tree Farm certifiers they have
 
02:45:05.030 --> 02:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
just launched with the nature
 
02:45:08.469 --> 02:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
conservancy a carbon capture program
 
02:45:10.349 --> 02:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
which is not getting very much traction
 
02:45:11.950 --> 02:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
because carbon caps are starting to
 
02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
smell a little bad in the state right
 
02:45:16.469 --> 02:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
now but there it's a completely
 
02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
different program I'm a small landowner
 
02:45:23.910 --> 02:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
compared to a lot of the the the the
 
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
folks we're talking
 
02:45:28.510 --> 02:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
about and programs like the American
 
02:45:30.469 --> 02:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
Forest Foundation I'm only singling that
 
02:45:32.110 --> 02:45:32.120 align:start position:0%
out because I know about their program
 
02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
and it's just been
 
02:45:36.190 --> 02:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
launched their objective is to get
 
02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
landowners like me or 30 acre land
 
02:45:41.870 --> 02:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
owners or 20 acre land owners to take a
 
02:45:43.550 --> 02:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
more deliberate approach to the
 
02:45:46.070 --> 02:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
management of their Timberland
 
02:45:49.150 --> 02:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
to provide a a revenue stream that might
 
02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh encourage them to hire a Forester so
 
02:45:53.349 --> 02:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
they know better how to make decisions
 
02:45:56.950 --> 02:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
about their land now again in the state
 
02:45:58.510 --> 02:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire which has always taken
 
02:46:01.030 --> 02:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
private property rights very seriously
 
02:46:02.590 --> 02:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
and in which it's the only state I've
 
02:46:05.710 --> 02:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
ever owned land in um and I manage an
 
02:46:07.870 --> 02:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
orchard and I manage a cery in an
 
02:46:10.349 --> 02:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
orchard in Lebanon on this land that
 
02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:15.630 align:start position:0%
 
1965

02:46:15.630 --> 02:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
1965
 
02:46:17.790 --> 02:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
this just is not consistent with the way
 
02:46:20.269 --> 02:46:20.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does or should do
 
02:46:23.070 --> 02:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
business and I agree this needs to be
 
02:46:25.469 --> 02:46:25.479 align:start position:0%
studied but I encourage you to consider
 
02:46:27.950 --> 02:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
that we are studying it now as these
 
02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
programs come out the landowners
 
02:46:32.710 --> 02:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
unconstrained are going to be taking
 
02:46:34.670 --> 02:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
very intelligent looks at all of these
 
02:46:35.950 --> 02:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
all of these
 
02:46:38.750 --> 02:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities and I've already rejected
 
02:46:40.910 --> 02:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
some of them there there are some some
 
02:46:43.269 --> 02:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
of these programs I would never would NE
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
never entertain for our land
 
02:46:49.630 --> 02:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
as Tom Thompson said this is an
 
02:46:51.990 --> 02:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
unwarranted restriction on my private
 
02:46:54.110 --> 02:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
property rights keeping me from
 
02:46:57.510 --> 02:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
considering for two years fair enough
 
02:47:00.190 --> 02:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
for any time keeping me from considering
 
02:47:03.230 --> 02:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
what's best for my family my land and my
 
02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
community and my
 
02:47:07.389 --> 02:47:07.399 align:start position:0%
state and I think you should consider
 
02:47:09.150 --> 02:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
please with
 
02:47:12.670 --> 02:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
respect that that sort of consideration
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
for the most part in America and
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
American in New Hampshire Timberland
 
02:47:19.870 --> 02:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
Wildland Farmland
 
02:47:22.750 --> 02:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
owners is is in pretty good hands right
 
02:47:25.910 --> 02:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
now and including for the examination of
 
02:47:29.150 --> 02:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
this sort of question so I encourage you
 
02:47:31.150 --> 02:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
to find this bill in expedient to
 
02:47:35.750 --> 02:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislate I encourage you to in some way
 
02:47:37.990 --> 02:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to study this I
 
02:47:40.630 --> 02:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
encourage you to I know you will be in
 
02:47:42.630 --> 02:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
including uh
 
02:47:45.150 --> 02:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities and uh forign Forest
 
02:47:46.990 --> 02:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
businesses and other land-based
 
02:47:50.910 --> 02:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
businesses please include landowners and
 
02:47:53.670 --> 02:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
landowner organizations like the forest
 
02:47:56.110 --> 02:47:56.120 align:start position:0%
timber land Owners Association foreign
 
02:47:59.630 --> 02:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
Bureau and also some of the land trusts
 
02:48:02.110 --> 02:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
and other entities that also have an
 
02:48:04.309 --> 02:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
interest in all of our land like the
 
02:48:06.070 --> 02:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
society for protection New Hampshire
 
02:48:09.389 --> 02:48:09.399 align:start position:0%
forests and the Upper Valley uh Land
 
02:48:12.150 --> 02:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
Trust I mean these are the these are the
 
02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
people who are going to be considering
 
02:48:17.790 --> 02:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
carbon C istration and that this market
 
02:48:20.469 --> 02:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
and it's appropriateness to what we are
 
02:48:22.950 --> 02:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish that's all I have

appreciate it representative parall has
 
02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:34.510 align:start position:0%
appreciate it representative parall has
a

02:48:34.510 --> 02:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:36.670 --> 02:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair V and thank you
 
02:48:38.910 --> 02:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today um the
 
02:48:42.269 --> 02:48:42.279 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill um says that the
 
02:48:46.550 --> 02:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
moratorium will be uh uh effective in
 
02:48:48.910 --> 02:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
order for the general court to develop a
 
02:48:51.870 --> 02:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
plan to properly regulate such sale but
 
02:48:54.190 --> 02:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't not really outline how this
 
02:48:56.870 --> 02:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
plan would be uh undertaken do I hear
 
02:48:59.710 --> 02:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
you saying that you think a a study
 
02:49:01.790 --> 02:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
committee a study commission or
 
02:49:04.070 --> 02:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
something that effect would be much more
 
02:49:07.030 --> 02:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:11.750 --> 02:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
moratorium I yes much more preferable I
 
02:49:14.790 --> 02:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
would abhor a moratorium under any
 
02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:16.990 align:start position:0%
would abhor a moratorium under any
circumstances

02:49:16.990 --> 02:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
02:49:19.950 --> 02:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
sir representative Ms has a question
 
02:49:21.590 --> 02:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:49:26.349 --> 02:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I I shared your
 
02:49:29.550 --> 02:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
concerns about a moratorium and I had
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
asked the previous uh uh person that
 
02:49:36.110 --> 02:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
came up whether a a moratorium was
 
02:49:39.150 --> 02:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
necessary um the response I got was that
 
02:49:41.269 --> 02:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
it is necessary
 
02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
because um you know what we what we
 
02:49:45.469 --> 02:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
don't want to have have happened as
 
02:49:47.790 --> 02:49:47.800 align:start position:0%
people during that 2-year period enter
 
02:49:50.429 --> 02:49:50.439 align:start position:0%
into 40 and 100e
 
02:49:53.030 --> 02:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
leases it you know the fact that that's
 
02:49:55.110 --> 02:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
the those are the terms under which
 
02:49:59.190 --> 02:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
these carbon um agreements um operate
 
02:50:01.389 --> 02:50:01.399 align:start position:0%
does that create any concern for you
 
02:50:04.229 --> 02:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
that you know we might by by announ by
 
02:50:05.710 --> 02:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
by announcing that we're studying it
 
02:50:07.190 --> 02:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
that all of a sudden there's a rush to
 
02:50:09.469 --> 02:50:09.479 align:start position:0%
People by people to enter into those
 
02:50:13.990 --> 02:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
agreements no I I and some of us will
 
02:50:17.309 --> 02:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
just have to agree to disagree it's
 
02:50:21.510 --> 02:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
it the moratorium is not necessary to
 
02:50:23.670 --> 02:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
study and it may in fact be an
 
02:50:26.150 --> 02:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
impediment to study it's going to make a
 
02:50:27.309 --> 02:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
lot of us
 
02:50:31.469 --> 02:50:31.479 align:start position:0%
angry and and it may incline some of us
 
02:50:33.309 --> 02:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
to just say to hell with it I mean the
 
02:50:36.229 --> 02:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
hypothetic I can't quite see somebody in
 
02:50:39.389 --> 02:50:39.399 align:start position:0%
Rage going out and you know putting up
 
02:50:41.870 --> 02:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
the shopping center on his Farmland
 
02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
immediately and blaming this but it's
 
02:50:47.910 --> 02:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
not it's just it is not necessary and
 
02:50:50.990 --> 02:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
not appropriate as a as a mechanism for
 
02:50:54.790 --> 02:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
Gathering people to uh to
 
02:50:58.830 --> 02:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
to examine a question and and and to
 
02:51:00.590 --> 02:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
assemble a
 
02:51:03.349 --> 02:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
policy and in particularly in this state
 
02:51:04.790 --> 02:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
again I'm sorry I keep saying
 
02:51:07.030 --> 02:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
inappropriate but there you have it I
 
02:51:08.389 --> 02:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
02:51:10.190 --> 02:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
inappropriate did that answer your
 
02:51:10.200 --> 02:51:11.070 align:start position:0%
inappropriate did that answer your
question

02:51:11.070 --> 02:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:51:13.830 --> 02:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
sir okay thank you seeing no further
 
02:51:16.590 --> 02:51:16.600 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank you and call
 
02:51:18.990 --> 02:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
Mr I thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:51:21.550 --> 02:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
speak and as ever for your service folks
 
02:51:23.469 --> 02:51:23.479 align:start position:0%
you're very welcome glad for you to be
 
02:51:36.269 --> 02:51:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:38.750 --> 02:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
coldbrook good morning Mr
 
02:51:41.790 --> 02:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
Foreman don't forget to turn on the mic
 
02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
right here right there we go thank you
 
02:51:46.150 --> 02:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
folks I'll try to be be very brief I'm a
 
02:51:48.590 --> 02:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
county commissioner selectman in cber
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
and as a county commissioner we have 23
 
02:51:53.830 --> 02:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns these
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns are mainly Forest
 
02:51:56.640 --> 02:51:58.429 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns are mainly Forest
ponds

02:51:58.429 --> 02:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
ponds
 
02:51:58.439 --> 02:52:00.630 align:start position:0%
ponds
Etc

02:52:00.630 --> 02:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
02:52:05.790 --> 02:52:05.800 align:start position:0%
and if this carbon credits thing is not
 
02:52:09.349 --> 02:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
somehow come to some type of conclusion
 
02:52:12.630 --> 02:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
where we can figure out how to because
 
02:52:14.269 --> 02:52:14.279 align:start position:0%
it looks like the carbon credits at this
 
02:52:17.870 --> 02:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
time could possibly uh definitely from
 
02:52:20.710 --> 02:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing reduce what forestry
 
02:52:22.950 --> 02:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
practices we currently have the practice
 
02:52:24.269 --> 02:52:24.279 align:start position:0%
that they're going to use from what I've
 
02:52:26.590 --> 02:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
been told is going to be different
 
02:52:28.670 --> 02:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to use a different type of
 
02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
Forestry practice they'll use their own
 
02:52:34.990 --> 02:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
Foresters okay Etc you already saw on
 
02:52:36.670 --> 02:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
the graphs today where we're headed on
 
02:52:39.590 --> 02:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
counting all right I represent from
 
02:52:42.750 --> 02:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh to Twin Mountain so I have
 
02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
Mills I have all the guys that are out
 
02:52:47.070 --> 02:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
there with the chainsaws very few
 
02:52:48.950 --> 02:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
manymore I should say but you know all
 
02:52:51.269 --> 02:52:51.279 align:start position:0%
the forestry equipment they have so we
 
02:52:54.229 --> 02:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
need to keep these folks going if that
 
02:52:57.190 --> 02:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
industry disappears if those guys
 
02:52:59.590 --> 02:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
disappear to get that industry back is
 
02:53:00.950 --> 02:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very difficult because
 
02:53:02.990 --> 02:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
of the huge investment they have in in
 
02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:04.630 align:start position:0%
of the huge investment they have in in
equivet

02:53:04.630 --> 02:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
equivet
 
02:53:07.870 --> 02:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
ETC and it's a way of life for us up
 
02:53:10.269 --> 02:53:10.279 align:start position:0%
there okay my grandfather came down from
 
02:53:13.190 --> 02:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
Canada as a French logger so on and so
 
02:53:15.429 --> 02:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
forth It's what we' do we've already
 
02:53:18.150 --> 02:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
seen what the decreases are doing our
 
02:53:21.630 --> 02:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
economics up there is is not good and
 
02:53:24.630 --> 02:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
the other major concern here that I have
 
02:53:27.469 --> 02:53:27.479 align:start position:0%
seen that I'm very nervous about is
 
02:53:30.469 --> 02:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
whether these lands because you already
 
02:53:31.910 --> 02:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
in Pittsburgh and I'm part of the
 
02:53:34.030 --> 02:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River Headwaters but I am
 
02:53:35.670 --> 02:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
not speaking for them I'm going to speak
 
02:53:38.550 --> 02:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
about my experience on there is you have
 
02:53:40.550 --> 02:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
an easement that was set up by Senator
 
02:53:43.870 --> 02:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
Greg and Senator Shaheen and that group
 
02:53:47.830 --> 02:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
20 years ago so these folks somewhat
 
02:53:49.950 --> 02:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
have to work with us even though there
 
02:53:52.150 --> 02:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
isn't told how much they're going to cut
 
02:53:54.309 --> 02:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
but there is a forestry easement they
 
02:53:55.349 --> 02:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
got the
 
02:53:58.389 --> 02:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
workforce they had there is all the
 
02:54:00.590 --> 02:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
other easements that are there now some
 
02:54:02.469 --> 02:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
of our lodge tracks right now if they
 
02:54:03.550 --> 02:54:03.560 align:start position:0%
get bought
 
02:54:07.710 --> 02:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
up what leverage do we have they can
 
02:54:09.630 --> 02:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
just buy them up put them in the carbon
 
02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
credits that's it it's done they can
 
02:54:16.630 --> 02:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
close our roads and and I mean Aurora is
 
02:54:19.550 --> 02:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
saying that you know we will you know
 
02:54:22.349 --> 02:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
don't worry your roads will be open Etc
 
02:54:24.550 --> 02:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
I'm involved with the
 
02:54:27.150 --> 02:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
ohvs The two clubs the Pittsburgh and
 
02:54:31.670 --> 02:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
Cobra Club asked for a threemile road to
 
02:54:35.429 --> 02:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
be added to the next year's group of
 
02:54:38.349 --> 02:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
roads and trails that are open it was
 
02:54:42.150 --> 02:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
taken out of the 5-year management plan
 
02:54:44.510 --> 02:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
and I asked and worked with through the
 
02:54:46.150 --> 02:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
folks and they said they would bring it
 
02:54:50.990 --> 02:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
back but so I'm seeing number one huge
 
02:54:52.830 --> 02:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
what it's going to affect our folks with
 
02:54:55.229 --> 02:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
the decrease in logging Etc all the
 
02:54:58.190 --> 02:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
other there could be a very s serious
 
02:55:00.309 --> 02:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
problem here with the availability of
 
02:55:03.550 --> 02:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
lands for recreation like snowmobiling
 
02:55:06.550 --> 02:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
Etc all that so I think we need to be
 
02:55:10.030 --> 02:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
protected at those areas like us that
 
02:55:11.590 --> 02:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
are all these hundreds and hundreds of
 
02:55:14.590 --> 02:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
square miles with just a few people our
 
02:55:18.870 --> 02:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
whole life is from tourist industry and
 
02:55:20.710 --> 02:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
that type of stuff and if it starts
 
02:55:22.710 --> 02:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
getting limited and our forestry
 
02:55:24.870 --> 02:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
industry disappears it's going to make a
 
02:55:27.229 --> 02:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
significant impact on all of the North
 
02:55:29.510 --> 02:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
Country thank
 
02:55:31.870 --> 02:55:31.880 align:start position:0%

02:56:00.349 --> 02:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
Holly I am operations manager of myland
 
02:56:03.190 --> 02:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
Lumber in mil New Hampshire um I've
 
02:56:05.389 --> 02:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
worked in the Sawmill industry for 45
 
02:56:07.510 --> 02:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
years I'm Third Generation in The
 
02:56:10.229 --> 02:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
Sawmill industry and the development of
 
02:56:12.830 --> 02:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
selling Forest carbon credits has
 
02:56:15.070 --> 02:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
greatly impacted the forest industry not
 
02:56:16.630 --> 02:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
only in the state of New Hampshire but
 
02:56:19.710 --> 02:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
across the US Forestry is one of the
 
02:56:21.550 --> 02:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
oldest landbased Industries in New
 
02:56:23.269 --> 02:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if we continue to Halt
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
Timber harvesting a lot of jobs will be
 
02:56:27.469 --> 02:56:27.479 align:start position:0%
at stake including employment at the
 
02:56:30.790 --> 02:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
Mill uh loggers truckers Foresters and
 
02:56:32.950 --> 02:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
many others that support the forest
 
02:56:35.550 --> 02:56:35.560 align:start position:0%
industry Sawmill operations like Mile
 
02:56:38.229 --> 02:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
and lumber are crucial because they
 
02:56:39.830 --> 02:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
represent one of the most important
 
02:56:41.550 --> 02:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
phases of the wood supply chain we
 
02:56:43.550 --> 02:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
connect the conversion of raw materials
 
02:56:45.510 --> 02:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
to Define
 
02:56:48.750 --> 02:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
products um in the beginning of
 
02:56:52.190 --> 02:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
2022 logging was significantly reduced
 
02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
in the areas of the upper Connecticut
 
02:56:57.349 --> 02:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
that Pittsburgh Stewart STS Clarksville
 
02:56:59.910 --> 02:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
mil and lumber immediately felt the
 
02:57:02.550 --> 02:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
blow without a consistent wood supply
 
02:57:04.990 --> 02:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
our Mill jobs are at stake during this
 
02:57:06.910 --> 02:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
transition from harvesting to carbon
 
02:57:09.630 --> 02:57:09.640 align:start position:0%
storage this leaves a lot of us with
 
02:57:12.870 --> 02:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
many unanswered questions such as do I
 
02:57:14.469 --> 02:57:14.479 align:start position:0%
have a clear plan to support these
 
02:57:16.590 --> 02:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
workers and businesses that go under as
 
02:57:19.830 --> 02:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
the demand for natural resources changes
 
02:57:21.950 --> 02:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
um do we have enough data to support the
 
02:57:23.830 --> 02:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
carbon credits actually work are
 
02:57:25.950 --> 02:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
companies just buying these credits to
 
02:57:28.870 --> 02:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
look like they're taking action when in
 
02:57:31.630 --> 02:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
reality are not even cutting
 
02:57:35.070 --> 02:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
emissions um to conclude I would like to
 
02:57:37.309 --> 02:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
say that there are many B benefits to
 
02:57:39.389 --> 02:57:39.399 align:start position:0%
continued sustainable harvesting Timber
 
02:57:42.190 --> 02:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
and selective Timber Harvest when trees
 
02:57:44.469 --> 02:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
are selectively marked and ethically
 
02:57:46.630 --> 02:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
harvested it improves Timber quality and
 
02:57:49.550 --> 02:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
value resulting in a continual source of
 
02:57:51.870 --> 02:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
income in a healthy Forest that is
 
02:57:54.750 --> 02:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
maintained and lastly Timber harvesting
 
02:57:56.429 --> 02:57:56.439 align:start position:0%
helps keep businesses like mil and
 
02:57:58.429 --> 02:57:58.439 align:start position:0%
lumber and its workers employed our
 
02:58:00.469 --> 02:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
everyday lives on these products
 
02:58:03.309 --> 02:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
produced and derived from the wood so
 
02:58:04.710 --> 02:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
this means we need to continue
 
02:58:08.030 --> 02:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
harvesting of Timber into the future
 
02:58:10.389 --> 02:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
thank you chair excellent thank you
 
02:58:12.429 --> 02:58:12.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate you taking time out of your
 
02:58:15.309 --> 02:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
busy day to come talk to us today
 
02:58:18.349 --> 02:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
02:58:20.790 --> 02:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move on to our next uh
 
02:58:23.030 --> 02:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
presenter who will
 
02:58:27.750 --> 02:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
be William lavandis of rumfield Maine
 
02:58:38.429 --> 02:58:38.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:40.710 --> 02:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
Inc good morning and welcome good
 
02:58:44.349 --> 02:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
morning uh my name is William lendis and
 
02:58:46.910 --> 02:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a wood buyer for ND paper which uh
 
02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
they own the uh paper mill in Rumford
 
02:58:51.550 --> 02:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
Maine so my primary job responsibility
 
02:58:54.309 --> 02:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
is to buy pulpwood for an ND paper chip
 
02:58:56.309 --> 02:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
plant which is located in shelburn New
 
02:58:58.469 --> 02:58:58.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh in a typical year the
 
02:59:00.469 --> 02:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
shelburn chip plant consumes just under
 
02:59:03.950 --> 02:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
300,000 tons of pulpwood about 200,000
 
02:59:06.429 --> 02:59:06.439 align:start position:0%
tons of that comes from New Hampshire uh
 
02:59:08.550 --> 02:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
150,000 tons come from the northern
 
02:59:13.309 --> 02:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
Three Counties and 100 sorry uh 100,000
 
02:59:15.790 --> 02:59:15.800 align:start position:0%
tons comes from Coos County this wood is
 
02:59:17.710 --> 02:59:17.720 align:start position:0%
harvested and delivered by over 30 new
 
02:59:19.190 --> 02:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire-based logging companies as
 
02:59:20.710 --> 02:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
well as by companies based in other
 
02:59:23.150 --> 02:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
states who employ New Hampshire citizens
 
02:59:24.710 --> 02:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
the purchase of the Connecticut lake
 
02:59:26.950 --> 02:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
property by Blue Source directly
 
02:59:28.710 --> 02:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
affected Shel bur's ability to procure
 
02:59:30.790 --> 02:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
wood at competitive rates I saw a
 
02:59:32.269 --> 02:59:32.279 align:start position:0%
one-third reduction in the amount of
 
02:59:33.710 --> 02:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
wood delivered from the Connecticut
 
02:59:35.630 --> 02:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
Lakes property with an even sharper
 
02:59:37.950 --> 02:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
decrease expected this year while this
 
02:59:39.790 --> 02:59:39.800 align:start position:0%
reduction is significant the indirect
 
02:59:41.469 --> 02:59:41.479 align:start position:0%
impacts on overall competition for
 
02:59:43.510 --> 02:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
pulpwood have been much more drastic
 
02:59:44.910 --> 02:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
another other Mill that was more
 
02:59:47.110 --> 02:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
directly impacted by this purchase
 
02:59:48.950 --> 02:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
aggressively intensified their pulpwood
 
02:59:50.830 --> 02:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
procurement from central New Hampshire
 
02:59:52.309 --> 02:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
which forced me to purchase more wood
 
02:59:53.550 --> 02:59:53.560 align:start position:0%
from Southern New Hampshire to
 
02:59:55.229 --> 02:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
compensate for the Lost
 
02:59:57.590 --> 02:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
wood while we have fully replaced this
 
02:59:59.389 --> 02:59:59.399 align:start position:0%
volume it has come from land that is
 
03:00:01.150 --> 03:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
much farther away at a much higher
 
03:00:03.349 --> 03:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
average cost I'm much more concerned
 
03:00:05.910 --> 03:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
about what happens if another large land
 
03:00:07.590 --> 03:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
company starts managing their land
 
03:00:10.070 --> 03:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
primarily for carbon in the same uh
 
03:00:12.229 --> 03:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
manner as blue Source this would almost
 
03:00:13.830 --> 03:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
certainly Force the closure of one of
 
03:00:15.910 --> 03:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
the five remaining operating Pulp and
 
03:00:17.510 --> 03:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
Paper Mills that procure wood from New
 
03:00:19.429 --> 03:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which would have a devastating
 
03:00:21.790 --> 03:00:21.800 align:start position:0%
impact on the timber industry and the
 
03:00:24.870 --> 03:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
economy of Coos County um forestry
 
03:00:26.910 --> 03:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
carbon credits are built on inaccurate
 
03:00:28.469 --> 03:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
assumptions that do not deliver their
 
03:00:30.510 --> 03:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
promised benefits Rumford and other
 
03:00:32.550 --> 03:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
paper mills we operate because the
 
03:00:34.070 --> 03:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
products that we make are critical
 
03:00:36.190 --> 03:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
products that Society needs when blue
 
03:00:37.950 --> 03:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
Source decides to stop harvesting Timber
 
03:00:39.670 --> 03:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
on its land the world does not
 
03:00:41.590 --> 03:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
correspondingly decide to reduce the
 
03:00:44.590 --> 03:00:44.600 align:start position:0%
amount of our products that it uses
 
03:00:46.309 --> 03:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
therefore we have to purchase wood from
 
03:00:48.429 --> 03:00:48.439 align:start position:0%
sources that are almost always farther
 
03:00:50.590 --> 03:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
away this means that carbon emissions
 
03:00:52.429 --> 03:00:52.439 align:start position:0%
will increase for example if I have to
 
03:00:54.030 --> 03:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
replace just one week's worth of wood
 
03:00:56.190 --> 03:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
from Coos County with wood from Southern
 
03:00:58.150 --> 03:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the trucks hauling that
 
03:01:00.349 --> 03:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
wood will easily travel over 20,000
 
03:01:03.030 --> 03:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
additional miles to get it to shelburn
 
03:01:04.830 --> 03:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
um and if we're unable to replace that
 
03:01:06.870 --> 03:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
wood then other Mills and other parts of
 
03:01:09.429 --> 03:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
the world will just increase their
 
03:01:12.030 --> 03:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
production so I think the carbon the
 
03:01:13.750 --> 03:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
carbon credits in Pittsburgh are not
 
03:01:15.389 --> 03:01:15.399 align:start position:0%
free market commodity they're not a free
 
03:01:17.309 --> 03:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
market product they're a compliance
 
03:01:19.429 --> 03:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
mechanism for regulations passed by
 
03:01:21.429 --> 03:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
California that were literally designed
 
03:01:23.349 --> 03:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
to push the negative impacts of those
 
03:01:26.670 --> 03:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
regulations onto other communities so by
 
03:01:28.429 --> 03:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
allowing carbon sales you're seeding New
 
03:01:30.670 --> 03:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's uh public policy authority
 
03:01:33.429 --> 03:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
to California and to hedge funds so I
 
03:01:35.750 --> 03:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
think you need to uh the state of New
 
03:01:36.950 --> 03:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs to figure out how to
 
03:01:38.710 --> 03:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
deal with these carbon credits but time
 
03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
is not on your side uh a hedge fund
 
03:01:42.670 --> 03:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
could purchase another Land Company
 
03:01:44.070 --> 03:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and shut down the timber
 
03:01:47.910 --> 03:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:50.750 --> 03:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you appreciate those
 
03:01:55.190 --> 03:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
statistics on New Hampshire Forest
 
03:02:00.349 --> 03:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
production do we have questions from the
 
03:02:02.950 --> 03:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none I guess I'll thank
 
03:02:06.790 --> 03:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
you and move on CH yes Tom
 
03:02:10.070 --> 03:02:10.080 align:start position:0%

what you're asking for could you supply
 
03:02:25.710 --> 03:02:25.720 align:start position:0%
written testimony I could uh email that

03:02:54.150 --> 03:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
were down to one
 
03:02:56.269 --> 03:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
before so
 
03:03:00.950 --> 03:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh lunch looks like a u a problem for
 
03:03:03.550 --> 03:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
the committee this today next I'll call
 
03:03:12.469 --> 03:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:12.479 --> 03:03:15.750 align:start position:0%
 
today

03:03:15.750 --> 03:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:15.760 --> 03:03:17.070 align:start position:0%
 
good

03:03:17.070 --> 03:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:03:20.110 --> 03:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Ross Karen I'm from
 
03:03:24.309 --> 03:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
gorm I'm a log buyer and Forester land
 
03:03:26.870 --> 03:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
owner small Sawmill operator and a
 
03:03:29.910 --> 03:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
lifelong resident of Coos County I speak
 
03:03:32.670 --> 03:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
here today as a Kos County
 
03:03:34.950 --> 03:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
resident um when I was trying to come up
 
03:03:38.349 --> 03:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
with talking points for today's hearing
 
03:03:40.429 --> 03:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
I found I had more questions than
 
03:03:42.510 --> 03:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
answers so here are some of those
 
03:03:42.520 --> 03:03:44.030 align:start position:0%
answers so here are some of those
questions

03:03:44.030 --> 03:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:03:46.030 --> 03:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
what if California decides that carbon
 
03:03:47.830 --> 03:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
credits are no longer valid and you've
 
03:03:50.429 --> 03:03:50.439 align:start position:0%
got a 100-year
 
03:03:52.510 --> 03:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
agreement what happens when a company
 
03:03:54.110 --> 03:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
who has purchased carbon credits on your
 
03:03:56.670 --> 03:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
land goes out of
 
03:03:58.870 --> 03:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
business what happens if somebody
 
03:04:01.309 --> 03:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
unknowingly purchases a property that is
 
03:04:03.269 --> 03:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
encumbered with a carbon project because
 
03:04:06.429 --> 03:04:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:09.150 --> 03:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere recognizing that a lack of
 
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
diverse Forest Products markets is a
 
03:04:14.190 --> 03:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
liability to land owners what are the
 
03:04:16.190 --> 03:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
short and long-term effects on these
 
03:04:16.200 --> 03:04:17.790 align:start position:0%
short and long-term effects on these
important

03:04:17.790 --> 03:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:04:20.070 --> 03:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
markets if large land owners get
 
03:04:22.590 --> 03:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
involved with carbon projects what is
 
03:04:25.710 --> 03:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
the effect on small land
 
03:04:28.469 --> 03:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
owners if a large landowner makes money
 
03:04:31.750 --> 03:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
on a carbon sale how does New Hampshire
 
03:04:36.110 --> 03:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:38.870 --> 03:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
taxed does carbon offset trading
 
03:04:40.510 --> 03:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
actually do anything to reduce carbon
 
03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
emissions and that's a that's a big
 
03:04:44.790 --> 03:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
question I mean I've read hours and
 
03:04:47.429 --> 03:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
hours and experts disagree pretty
 
03:04:50.429 --> 03:04:50.439 align:start position:0%
strongly on that um the unregulated
 
03:04:52.229 --> 03:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
carbon Market has many issues affecting
 
03:04:52.239 --> 03:04:54.150 align:start position:0%
carbon Market has many issues affecting
its

03:04:54.150 --> 03:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
its
 
03:04:56.870 --> 03:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
credibility uh why is Delta Airlines
 
03:04:59.790 --> 03:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
involved in a CL class action lawsuit
 
03:05:02.150 --> 03:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
accusing the company that relies on
 
03:05:04.750 --> 03:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
carbon offsets of greenwashing over its
 
03:05:08.710 --> 03:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:11.710 --> 03:05:11.720 align:start position:0%
claims do we want unregulated big money
 
03:05:13.030 --> 03:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
outside interest to control New
 
03:05:13.040 --> 03:05:14.349 align:start position:0%
outside interest to control New
Hampshire

03:05:14.349 --> 03:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:05:18.190 --> 03:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
future I think uh representative Davis
 
03:05:20.110 --> 03:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
recognized these questions he says
 
03:05:23.550 --> 03:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
there's way more questions than answers
 
03:05:25.550 --> 03:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
and um his intention is to slow things
 
03:05:28.150 --> 03:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
down and try to do it right try to do
 
03:05:29.590 --> 03:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire
 
03:05:31.910 --> 03:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
way thank
 
03:05:35.389 --> 03:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions from the
 
03:05:37.910 --> 03:05:37.920 align:start position:0%

uh thank you Mr chairman thank you uh

03:05:42.950 --> 03:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
email form because you brought up a
 
03:05:44.670 --> 03:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
number of point that we hav't heard
 
03:05:46.550 --> 03:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
before yes I can do
 
03:05:49.110 --> 03:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
that we would appreciate that

uh thank you chair V uh just as uh via
 
03:05:57.429 --> 03:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
devil's advocate for a minute the one
 
03:05:59.229 --> 03:05:59.239 align:start position:0%
question which I've been having which I
 
03:06:03.429 --> 03:06:03.439 align:start position:0%
didn't hear not hear you ask is perhaps
 
03:06:05.469 --> 03:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
uh the uh inability of the logging
 
03:06:07.349 --> 03:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
industry to compete with these other
 
03:06:09.630 --> 03:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
sources of Rec of income for the land
 
03:06:11.990 --> 03:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
owners the problem with the failure of
 
03:06:14.110 --> 03:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
the laog of the
 
03:06:17.510 --> 03:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
industry in other words in a free market
 
03:06:20.349 --> 03:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
uh do we really want to uh put our thumb
 
03:06:21.429 --> 03:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
on one
 
03:06:23.630 --> 03:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
industry well that's a that's a very
 
03:06:25.590 --> 03:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
good question and I'm a free market type
 
03:06:27.910 --> 03:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
of guy landowner rights type of guy I I
 
03:06:29.229 --> 03:06:29.239 align:start position:0%
do have some
 
03:06:32.190 --> 03:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
points name something that is completely
 
03:06:33.870 --> 03:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
unregulated in this
 
03:06:36.150 --> 03:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
country we talk about land owner's
 
03:06:38.510 --> 03:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
rights but I can't Timber I can't do
 
03:06:40.110 --> 03:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
timber harvesting on my property without
 
03:06:42.670 --> 03:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
filing an intent to cut without filing
 
03:06:44.710 --> 03:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
without fing following the laws uh we
 
03:06:47.389 --> 03:06:47.399 align:start position:0%
have Wetlands regulations uh what about
 
03:06:50.190 --> 03:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical industry what about
 
03:06:53.630 --> 03:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
Banking and finance food we have zoning
 
03:06:56.510 --> 03:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
ordinances building codes everything's
 
03:06:58.550 --> 03:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
regulated why should this be completely
 
03:07:00.550 --> 03:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
unregulated when nothing when everything
 
03:07:00.560 --> 03:07:02.790 align:start position:0%
unregulated when nothing when everything
else

03:07:02.790 --> 03:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
else
 
03:07:06.229 --> 03:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
is and is it free market if it's coming
 
03:07:08.469 --> 03:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
from the state of California that's not
 
03:07:10.910 --> 03:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
really free market
 
03:07:15.229 --> 03:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:17.870 --> 03:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
okay good points seeing no further
 
03:07:21.389 --> 03:07:21.399 align:start position:0%
questions I'll now ask Jason stock of
 
03:07:24.229 --> 03:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
the Timberland Owners Association to
 
03:07:27.150 --> 03:07:27.160 align:start position:0%

03:08:06.190 --> 03:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
him one follow-up
 
03:08:08.349 --> 03:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
question I would advise you to go out in
 
03:08:10.550 --> 03:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
the hall and ask representative Kelly
 
03:08:11.990 --> 03:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
that question and then you can give us
 
03:08:18.229 --> 03:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:20.510 --> 03:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead well thank you Mr for the
 
03:08:22.269 --> 03:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
record my name is Jason stock I'm the
 
03:08:23.590 --> 03:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
03:08:26.630 --> 03:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
Timberland Owners Association and it's
 
03:08:27.950 --> 03:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
good to be back in front of this
 
03:08:29.790 --> 03:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
committee and it's good to be back not
 
03:08:32.910 --> 03:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
talking biomass so this is
 
03:08:35.590 --> 03:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
fun although this is this can be as
 
03:08:38.309 --> 03:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
contentious as you have seen um our
 
03:08:41.150 --> 03:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
membership includes land owners loggers
 
03:08:44.750 --> 03:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
Foresters wood using Ms and this is an
 
03:08:47.389 --> 03:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
issue that um we have spent a lot of
 
03:08:49.510 --> 03:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
time evaluating and studying and it's
 
03:08:51.670 --> 03:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
not every day that I have prominent
 
03:08:54.429 --> 03:08:54.439 align:start position:0%
members and actually directors coming in
 
03:08:56.830 --> 03:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
on a piece of legislation on opposite
 
03:08:59.790 --> 03:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
sides which you've experienced today but
 
03:09:01.710 --> 03:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking on behalf of the
 
03:09:03.590 --> 03:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
organization and this is one of the
 
03:09:05.630 --> 03:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
things that we bring to the table is we
 
03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
try to get consensus on issues within
 
03:09:10.150 --> 03:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
the organization recognizing that
 
03:09:11.830 --> 03:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
Everyone's entitled to their personal
 
03:09:14.309 --> 03:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
opinions or company's opinions but we
 
03:09:16.710 --> 03:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
try to take a step back and look at the
 
03:09:19.389 --> 03:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
industry and industrywide
 
03:09:22.830 --> 03:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
um and and when we studied this we said
 
03:09:24.990 --> 03:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
let's number one let's limit our look at
 
03:09:27.309 --> 03:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
land use and the industry we're not
 
03:09:29.309 --> 03:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
going to get into the the discussion
 
03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
about whether Forest carbon credits are
 
03:09:33.269 --> 03:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
an effective way to mitigate climate
 
03:09:35.309 --> 03:09:35.319 align:start position:0%
change that's not our that's not our
 
03:09:37.349 --> 03:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
thing we're going to look at impacts on
 
03:09:40.269 --> 03:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
land use look at impacts um we don't
 
03:09:42.590 --> 03:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
endorse programs We Believe land owners
 
03:09:44.510 --> 03:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
have a have a right they can choose to
 
03:09:47.550 --> 03:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
be in or out of a carbon program that's
 
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
their prerogative but we do think they
 
03:09:51.910 --> 03:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
need to be educated and you've heard
 
03:09:54.070 --> 03:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
today there's a lot of questions about
 
03:09:56.229 --> 03:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
carbon programs how they're
 
03:09:59.150 --> 03:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
structured um we recognize that stored
 
03:10:02.229 --> 03:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
Forest Products as Mr L said do store
 
03:10:04.309 --> 03:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
carbon this is stored carbon I'm sitting
 
03:10:06.429 --> 03:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
on and and sitting behind and that
 
03:10:08.910 --> 03:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
carbon program should recognize that and
 
03:10:10.710 --> 03:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
lastly and probably most importantly
 
03:10:14.790 --> 03:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
multiple use management is is is is key
 
03:10:18.790 --> 03:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
for us for for Land Management good
 
03:10:21.710 --> 03:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
forestry equals good carbon
 
03:10:25.469 --> 03:10:25.479 align:start position:0%
management um and you know it's like
 
03:10:27.630 --> 03:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
anything else too much of one thing or
 
03:10:31.269 --> 03:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
another can create problems um one of
 
03:10:33.070 --> 03:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
the beauties of New Hampshire is that we
 
03:10:35.990 --> 03:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
have a lot of land owners and I'll get
 
03:10:39.190 --> 03:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
calls uh regularly people asking are you
 
03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
you know do we need a law to to to ban
 
03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:43.510 align:start position:0%
you know do we need a law to to to ban
clearcuts

03:10:43.510 --> 03:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
clearcuts
 
03:10:45.830 --> 03:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
um today we're looking at a moratorium
 
03:10:49.309 --> 03:10:49.319 align:start position:0%
on carbon and my response always is is
 
03:10:52.150 --> 03:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
that it's very unlikely that's that
 
03:10:54.070 --> 03:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
everyone is going to wake up one morning
 
03:10:56.510 --> 03:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
and say today's the day let's call
 
03:10:58.229 --> 03:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
Chopper Bob we're going to we're going
 
03:11:01.070 --> 03:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
to clear cut the back 40 New Hampshire
 
03:11:03.309 --> 03:11:03.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't work that way we have different
 
03:11:04.990 --> 03:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
land owners they have different
 
03:11:07.389 --> 03:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
management schemes they have different
 
03:11:10.070 --> 03:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
Management Programs they manage for very
 
03:11:12.030 --> 03:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
different things and yes we do have
 
03:11:14.429 --> 03:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
members in our association that manage
 
03:11:17.229 --> 03:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
for old growth they manage for long
 
03:11:20.550 --> 03:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
rotation Northern Hardwoods and they
 
03:11:22.750 --> 03:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
they manage for Upland bird habitat
 
03:11:25.910 --> 03:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
which requires a lot of early succession
 
03:11:29.670 --> 03:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
habitat which you obtain by doing
 
03:11:33.070 --> 03:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
clearcuts um but having said all that
 
03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
carbon carbon programs can can work in
 
03:11:39.870 --> 03:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
conjunction with sustainable forestry
 
03:11:42.309 --> 03:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
and Forest management we have seen that
 
03:11:47.750 --> 03:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
we are seeing that um and the uh two
 
03:11:51.510 --> 03:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
examples we have a landowner that has I
 
03:11:55.110 --> 03:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
want to say 15,000 Acres they have it's
 
03:11:57.710 --> 03:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
a family ownership and so now you've
 
03:11:59.429 --> 03:11:59.439 align:start position:0%
getting to the third generation where
 
03:12:02.630 --> 03:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
you now have grandchildren kind of as
 
03:12:05.229 --> 03:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
you know looking at this property and
 
03:12:07.110 --> 03:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
they have gone from the the property
 
03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
they've gone through the property doing
 
03:12:11.269 --> 03:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
thinnings doing you know doing the
 
03:12:13.229 --> 03:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
management and that prop property has
 
03:12:16.030 --> 03:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
kind of hit a growth phase we've gone
 
03:12:19.309 --> 03:12:19.319 align:start position:0%
through we've taken all the junk out um
 
03:12:21.910 --> 03:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
and now for the next 15 to 20 years
 
03:12:23.229 --> 03:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to grow
 
03:12:26.990 --> 03:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
wood but you have folks that land still
 
03:12:29.070 --> 03:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
has a carrying cost there's still a
 
03:12:32.030 --> 03:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
carrying cost associated with that taxes
 
03:12:34.790 --> 03:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
property lines you name it and so
 
03:12:36.870 --> 03:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
they're looking at Carbon is saying wait
 
03:12:38.990 --> 03:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
a minute here's an opportunity for us to
 
03:12:41.830 --> 03:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
glean some Revenue at the same time we
 
03:12:43.309 --> 03:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
grow our wood
 
03:12:46.309 --> 03:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
and after that 20year contract guess
 
03:12:48.550 --> 03:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
what we're going to have a lot of nice
 
03:12:48.560 --> 03:12:49.710 align:start position:0%
what we're going to have a lot of nice
Northern

03:12:49.710 --> 03:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
Northern
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
hardwood ready for ready for Harvest
 
03:12:55.469 --> 03:12:55.479 align:start position:0%
ready for the market isn't this doesn't
 
03:12:57.990 --> 03:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
this fit well within our our scheme and
 
03:13:00.030 --> 03:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't this fit fit well within that
 
03:13:02.710 --> 03:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
family's kind of cash flow
 
03:13:06.750 --> 03:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
process another example that I have is a
 
03:13:10.150 --> 03:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
a a large land owner outside the region
 
03:13:12.630 --> 03:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
they grow Plantation Plantation they do
 
03:13:15.309 --> 03:13:15.319 align:start position:0%
Plantation forestry they have an area
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
Mill that's been telling them look we
 
03:13:19.990 --> 03:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
want wood a certain diameter that's
 
03:13:22.870 --> 03:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
really where our Sawmill really sings
 
03:13:24.870 --> 03:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
that's what we want our customers want
 
03:13:27.309 --> 03:13:27.319 align:start position:0%
that this landowner that happens to be a
 
03:13:29.910 --> 03:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
real estate investment trust says I get
 
03:13:33.510 --> 03:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
that but our our cash flow models tell
 
03:13:37.309 --> 03:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
us that we you know for maximum
 
03:13:40.190 --> 03:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
Financial maturity we have to harvest a
 
03:13:44.110 --> 03:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
smaller diameter well guess what carbon
 
03:13:46.990 --> 03:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
markets we can sell that land into we
 
03:13:50.150 --> 03:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
can sell that wood into a carbon Market
 
03:13:52.309 --> 03:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
grow it that extra
 
03:13:55.510 --> 03:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
diameter we can get paid compensated for
 
03:13:58.710 --> 03:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
that growth period and at the same time
 
03:14:01.469 --> 03:14:01.479 align:start position:0%
satisfy a sawmill customer of ours that
 
03:14:03.429 --> 03:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
really would like that larger diameter
 
03:14:06.309 --> 03:14:06.319 align:start position:0%
wood so these are just two examples of
 
03:14:10.269 --> 03:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
how carbon markets can augment or fit
 
03:14:14.229 --> 03:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
within fit Within Forest management and
 
03:14:17.469 --> 03:14:17.479 align:start position:0%
even satisfy a particular business's
 
03:14:20.150 --> 03:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
needs having said that it it really is
 
03:14:22.070 --> 03:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that we're having this
 
03:14:24.229 --> 03:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
conversation in the context of what I
 
03:14:26.670 --> 03:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
would say is an incredibly unique
 
03:14:29.630 --> 03:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
project the Connecticut leges project
 
03:14:32.269 --> 03:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
incredibly unique has a coner it's a
 
03:14:35.389 --> 03:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
large it's a landscape scale ownership
 
03:14:37.990 --> 03:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
has a con working Forest conservation
 
03:14:40.750 --> 03:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
easement um held by the state of New
 
03:14:44.910 --> 03:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that when we look at that
 
03:14:47.389 --> 03:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
project and we look at kind of the the
 
03:14:50.790 --> 03:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
swirl of controversy around carbon and
 
03:14:53.070 --> 03:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
as it comes out of that project that is
 
03:14:55.670 --> 03:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
in our mind an easement issue and as you
 
03:14:58.830 --> 03:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
heard from director Hackley there are
 
03:15:00.389 --> 03:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
there's the letter and the intent of
 
03:15:03.429 --> 03:15:03.439 align:start position:0%
that easement and that's really where
 
03:15:06.550 --> 03:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
for us the rubber hits the road and so
 
03:15:09.110 --> 03:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
to pass a two-year moratorium that would
 
03:15:11.790 --> 03:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
affect that family ownership that's
 
03:15:14.110 --> 03:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
looking to try a cash flow their
 
03:15:16.710 --> 03:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
property during this growth phase and
 
03:15:19.189 --> 03:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
and hold on to that land as Timberland
 
03:15:21.309 --> 03:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
when maybe you have a grandchild one of
 
03:15:23.110 --> 03:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
the grandkids saying geez we could start
 
03:15:24.990 --> 03:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
carving some Lots off of this and make a
 
03:15:28.429 --> 03:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
little bit more money um you know to say
 
03:15:31.110 --> 03:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
all right let's throw out carbon let's
 
03:15:33.670 --> 03:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
let's put a two-year stay on this you're
 
03:15:36.189 --> 03:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
going to affect folks like that and so
 
03:15:38.910 --> 03:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
that's why we think that this particular
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
proposal is is not worth pursuing now
 
03:15:45.389 --> 03:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
having said that um and you heard about
 
03:15:48.750 --> 03:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
the you know the timber tax question
 
03:15:52.229 --> 03:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
795 um and I would agree that piece of
 
03:15:54.550 --> 03:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
that piece of law is
 
03:15:57.670 --> 03:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
complicated but we have very complicated
 
03:16:01.910 --> 03:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
or complex solving uh tax officials at
 
03:16:04.870 --> 03:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue I would say
 
03:16:06.189 --> 03:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
you know one thing that could come out
 
03:16:09.070 --> 03:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
of this discussion is directing the
 
03:16:11.590 --> 03:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue to do a deep dive
 
03:16:12.950 --> 03:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
into this
 
03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
we think when we look at 795 they have
 
03:16:19.349 --> 03:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
authority but have Dr take a look at it
 
03:16:22.269 --> 03:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
they have the tax experts they have the
 
03:16:25.710 --> 03:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
timber tax experts and they can bring in
 
03:16:28.030 --> 03:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
some Foresters and biometricians and
 
03:16:30.790 --> 03:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
really look at how you do how would you
 
03:16:33.429 --> 03:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
do this in a way that would not attract
 
03:16:35.950 --> 03:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
the litigation that you heard about
 
03:16:38.269 --> 03:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
earlier as for the
 
03:16:41.269 --> 03:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
registry um and you'll see on our on our
 
03:16:43.870 --> 03:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
talking points that I passed around one
 
03:16:45.550 --> 03:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
of the things that we really want to
 
03:16:48.670 --> 03:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
promote is transparency and we recommend
 
03:16:51.269 --> 03:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
that you look at the registry of deeds
 
03:16:54.150 --> 03:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
let's face it you buy a house you buy a
 
03:16:56.750 --> 03:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
piece of land where do you look to see
 
03:16:59.229 --> 03:16:59.239 align:start position:0%
if something's encumbered you look at
 
03:17:02.030 --> 03:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
the deed and you go to the county go to
 
03:17:03.950 --> 03:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
the county courthouse and so that was a
 
03:17:06.070 --> 03:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation that we actually came up
 
03:17:08.590 --> 03:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
with and so if you're Coos County and
 
03:17:10.710 --> 03:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
you're concerned about how much land is
 
03:17:13.110 --> 03:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
is going to be enrolled in carbon
 
03:17:16.510 --> 03:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
programs you can go to Lancaster to the
 
03:17:19.790 --> 03:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
county office and and check the check
 
03:17:22.349 --> 03:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
the registry of deeds and that was for
 
03:17:24.389 --> 03:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
us that's where we thought would be the
 
03:17:27.229 --> 03:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
most appropriate way I recognize some of
 
03:17:29.150 --> 03:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
these carbon deals in in these
 
03:17:31.229 --> 03:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
transactions their contracts their
 
03:17:31.239 --> 03:17:32.189 align:start position:0%
transactions their contracts their
private

03:17:32.189 --> 03:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
private
 
03:17:34.790 --> 03:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
contracts um and there may be some some
 
03:17:36.990 --> 03:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
elements of it that do not you don't
 
03:17:39.389 --> 03:17:39.399 align:start position:0%
want to have recorded out there for all
 
03:17:42.469 --> 03:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
to see in the registry and I spoke to
 
03:17:44.349 --> 03:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
our our Council and said is there a way
 
03:17:46.189 --> 03:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
to record a
 
03:17:48.550 --> 03:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
transaction that doesn't really get into
 
03:17:50.670 --> 03:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
the nitty-gritty of the deal and he says
 
03:17:54.750 --> 03:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
it's done every day all the time and its
 
03:17:58.429 --> 03:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
leases are recorded I think it's RSA 177
 
03:17:58.439 --> 03:17:59.750 align:start position:0%
leases are recorded I think it's RSA 177
colon

03:17:59.750 --> 03:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
colon
 
03:18:03.870 --> 03:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
7-a that's where leases leases are are
 
03:18:07.110 --> 03:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
recorded um in the registry of deeds so
 
03:18:09.710 --> 03:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
again you're not you're not providing
 
03:18:11.710 --> 03:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
the lease payments the terms of the
 
03:18:15.070 --> 03:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
lease all of that detail that you as the
 
03:18:17.189 --> 03:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
tenant or you as the landlord would want
 
03:18:20.309 --> 03:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
out there on the street but you're
 
03:18:22.189 --> 03:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
recognizing that or you're you're
 
03:18:24.790 --> 03:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
recording that that property has a lease
 
03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
that property is beholding to a lease
 
03:18:30.269 --> 03:18:30.279 align:start position:0%
that was done and therefore a subsequent
 
03:18:34.189 --> 03:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
owner or God forbid a foreclosure they
 
03:18:35.670 --> 03:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
come in and they look and they say all
 
03:18:37.229 --> 03:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
right we're going to we're going to
 
03:18:40.110 --> 03:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
foreclose on this property there sits
 
03:18:42.630 --> 03:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
that lease all right there's a lease on
 
03:18:45.950 --> 03:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
this we have to factor that in and so it
 
03:18:49.150 --> 03:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
protects both parties in this case it
 
03:18:51.429 --> 03:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
would protect the land owner it would
 
03:18:53.550 --> 03:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
protect in fact it would protect the
 
03:18:55.910 --> 03:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
carbon company but also it would protect
 
03:18:58.469 --> 03:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
future land owners again the scenario we
 
03:18:59.790 --> 03:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to have and you heard this
 
03:19:03.750 --> 03:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
earlier Grandpa does a carbon deal kids
 
03:19:05.910 --> 03:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
grandkids don't know about it the
 
03:19:07.389 --> 03:19:07.399 align:start position:0%
property comes down to them and they
 
03:19:10.229 --> 03:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
said all right let's cut some wood and
 
03:19:12.309 --> 03:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
then they get a nasty letter from a car
 
03:19:14.790 --> 03:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
deal saying you're in violation here are
 
03:19:17.389 --> 03:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
some serious fines and penalties we're
 
03:19:21.030 --> 03:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
coming after you again that's that's one
 
03:19:22.630 --> 03:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
of our our
 
03:19:24.870 --> 03:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations um that's one of our
 
03:19:26.349 --> 03:19:26.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations in terms of the
 
03:19:28.870 --> 03:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
transparency aspect of
 
03:19:31.710 --> 03:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
that having said all that I'm I know I'm
 
03:19:33.670 --> 03:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
between you and lunch and I apologize
 
03:19:35.309 --> 03:19:35.319 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to just get our our
 
03:19:37.150 --> 03:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
comments and our thoughts on the record
 
03:19:38.870 --> 03:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the opportunity to
 
03:19:40.710 --> 03:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
speak and if there is a subcommittee or
 
03:19:43.790 --> 03:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
a work session I'm happy to participate
 
03:19:46.870 --> 03:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
and I can bring land owners and others
 
03:19:49.110 --> 03:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
including Forest industry to the table
 
03:19:51.309 --> 03:19:51.319 align:start position:0%
and we can have that conversation thank
 
03:19:55.110 --> 03:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions for Mr
 
03:19:58.349 --> 03:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
stock boy I did good seeing none well
 
03:20:00.590 --> 03:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
you're really hungry you got off you got
 
03:20:04.189 --> 03:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
off easy Jason thank you thanks a lot
 
03:20:06.550 --> 03:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
okay the person who gets the last word
 
03:20:08.790 --> 03:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
here this morning or this afternoon now
 
03:20:20.950 --> 03:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:22.630 --> 03:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
I had all the cards from last week I
 
03:20:25.950 --> 03:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
don't recall seeing it I can do okay
 
03:20:25.960 --> 03:20:29.670 align:start position:0%
don't recall seeing it I can do okay
thank

03:20:29.670 --> 03:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:32.389 --> 03:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
you and uh good afternoon thank you
 
03:20:34.070 --> 03:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Matt
 
03:20:36.630 --> 03:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
Ley I'm the public policy director for
 
03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
the society for the protection of New
 
03:20:41.309 --> 03:20:41.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Forest um and I will be quick
 
03:20:44.870 --> 03:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
we do opposed the bill um and we take
 
03:20:48.349 --> 03:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
that position with full recognition that
 
03:20:51.150 --> 03:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
these carbon markets have generated a
 
03:20:53.550 --> 03:20:53.560 align:start position:0%
lot of concern um you know particularly
 
03:20:56.189 --> 03:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
as you've heard about you know uh
 
03:20:59.189 --> 03:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
impacts to the forest products industry
 
03:21:01.030 --> 03:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know we think though the other side
 
03:21:05.030 --> 03:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
of the uh argument here is that you know
 
03:21:08.150 --> 03:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
they may be another source of income um
 
03:21:11.550 --> 03:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
especially for the smaller land hose uh
 
03:21:13.510 --> 03:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
land holders Forest land holders you
 
03:21:15.630 --> 03:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
know those people owning 100 acres or a
 
03:21:18.750 --> 03:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
thousand acres if it gives them another
 
03:21:21.550 --> 03:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
source of income to help them manage
 
03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
their Forest land we think that's could
 
03:21:26.990 --> 03:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
be a good thing now um you know I will
 
03:21:28.990 --> 03:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
also say that we certainly are not
 
03:21:33.269 --> 03:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
opposed to any type of um you know State
 
03:21:35.670 --> 03:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
oversight or state regulation of these
 
03:21:37.950 --> 03:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
carbon markets I mean clearly as as
 
03:21:40.349 --> 03:21:40.359 align:start position:0%
Jason mentioned there should at the very
 
03:21:42.550 --> 03:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
least be transparency about what's out
 
03:21:46.110 --> 03:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
there for these um but you know the bill
 
03:21:47.469 --> 03:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
has written you know we just feel a
 
03:21:50.510 --> 03:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
moratorium is a is a blunt instrument to
 
03:21:54.189 --> 03:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
address you know what are important
 
03:21:57.229 --> 03:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
issues so we really encourage you know
 
03:21:59.070 --> 03:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
the committee to you know look at
 
03:22:01.830 --> 03:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
different ways to address
 
03:22:04.670 --> 03:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
these thank you um I'm Meredith Hatfield
 
03:22:07.189 --> 03:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
with the nature conservancy and we agree
 
03:22:09.469 --> 03:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
um with the forest society's comments
 
03:22:12.550 --> 03:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
and I did just um want to mention that
 
03:22:14.349 --> 03:22:14.359 align:start position:0%
uh it has been referenced earlier that
 
03:22:16.590 --> 03:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
the nature conservancy and the American
 
03:22:18.830 --> 03:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
Forest Foundation jointly have a program
 
03:22:21.309 --> 03:22:21.319 align:start position:0%
called the family forest carbon program
 
03:22:24.469 --> 03:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
to um provide some of these
 
03:22:26.590 --> 03:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities that um Jason stock
 
03:22:29.229 --> 03:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
discussed and Matt just mentioned um to
 
03:22:31.229 --> 03:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
those smaller land owners so our program
 
03:22:33.750 --> 03:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
is available to Forest land owners
 
03:22:36.750 --> 03:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
between 30 and 2400 Acres the program is
 
03:22:39.790 --> 03:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
just rolling out um it does provide for
 
03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
a forest management plan for that owner
 
03:22:44.389 --> 03:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
so our hope is that it would improve uh
 
03:22:47.349 --> 03:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
Forest management practices and it uh
 
03:22:50.830 --> 03:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
our program does not limit recreational
 
03:22:53.870 --> 03:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
use in any way so whatever the landowner
 
03:22:56.309 --> 03:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
wishes to do with that property um we
 
03:22:58.030 --> 03:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
work with them to see if our program is
 
03:23:00.429 --> 03:23:00.439 align:start position:0%
a fit um and if so it it would be a
 
03:23:03.630 --> 03:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
20year contract and if you did um have a
 
03:23:05.710 --> 03:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
work session or if this turns into a
 
03:23:07.950 --> 03:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
study uh we would be happy to have one
 
03:23:10.189 --> 03:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
of our experts come and talk about that
 
03:23:13.110 --> 03:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
more thank you so I should say we do
 
03:23:15.590 --> 03:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
oppose the Bill thank you okay thank you
 
03:23:18.750 --> 03:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
so miss Hatfield the The Nature
 
03:23:20.510 --> 03:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
Conservancy is the sponsor of this
 
03:23:23.229 --> 03:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
family forest carbon program jointly
 
03:23:25.309 --> 03:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
with the American Forest foundation and
 
03:23:27.750 --> 03:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
they did file a letter of testimony also
 
03:23:30.269 --> 03:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the
 
03:23:32.950 --> 03:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
bill and is there a website where we
 
03:23:36.590 --> 03:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
could U go find out about it yes what
 
03:23:38.309 --> 03:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
I'll do is I'll follow up with my
 
03:23:40.910 --> 03:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
comments and writing um to the committee
 
03:23:42.429 --> 03:23:42.439 align:start position:0%
and I'll include those those links for
 
03:23:44.030 --> 03:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
you that would be perfect thank you

04:16:44.269 --> 04:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
cards from people who wanted to testify
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
and we saved those pink cards I have
 
04:16:48.910 --> 04:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
them we're going to start with those
 
04:16:52.389 --> 04:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
people and in addition to that because
 
04:16:55.429 --> 04:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
we have received I don't know four or
 
04:16:58.149 --> 04:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
five additional cards which puts us up
 
04:17:02.269 --> 04:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
around 15 16 people we're going to plus
 
04:17:04.710 --> 04:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
two more that I was just handed we're
 
04:17:10.670 --> 04:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:12.469 --> 04:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
we're going
 
04:17:15.670 --> 04:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
to uh restrict everyone to three minutes

each presentation will be three minutes
 
04:17:23.229 --> 04:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
or less so we will start with
 
04:17:23.239 --> 04:17:25.030 align:start position:0%

bordette uh bour okay thank you go right
 
04:18:15.790 --> 04:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
ahead please three minutes if one does a
 
04:18:17.070 --> 04:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
simple Google search for the word
 
04:18:19.590 --> 04:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
geoengineering you get 300 million over
 
04:18:22.030 --> 04:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
300 Million results of which
 
04:18:25.309 --> 04:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
1,920 are videos uh if one does a simple
 
04:18:26.910 --> 04:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
Google search for the word Chemtrails
 
04:18:28.429 --> 04:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
you get
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
7,500,000 results of which 690,000 are
 
04:18:34.670 --> 04:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
are videos during the last session I
 
04:18:35.990 --> 04:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
attended with you it seemed to me that
 
04:18:37.149 --> 04:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
some of you are question questioning the
 
04:18:39.469 --> 04:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
reality of geoengineering I ask you why
 
04:18:40.750 --> 04:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
would there be so much information
 
04:18:42.870 --> 04:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
available on the web including footage
 
04:18:44.510 --> 04:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
of planes spraying our skies that this
 
04:18:46.189 --> 04:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
was truly not happening the aerosol
 
04:18:47.510 --> 04:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
trails that they are spraying are
 
04:18:49.590 --> 04:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
routinely turned off and on by the
 
04:18:51.830 --> 04:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
operator this would not be possible if
 
04:18:54.109 --> 04:18:54.119 align:start position:0%
these were mere crails these feet would
 
04:18:56.469 --> 04:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
require turning the engines off and on
 
04:18:58.670 --> 04:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
again during mid-flight I have eight
 
04:19:00.830 --> 04:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
video links on your hand out there that
 
04:19:03.149 --> 04:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
that show this
 
04:19:05.990 --> 04:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
phenomenon Bill Gates admitted to a plan
 
04:19:08.030 --> 04:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
to combat climate climate change by
 
04:19:09.469 --> 04:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
blocking out our son using some of the
 
04:19:11.149 --> 04:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
geoengineering strategies that have been
 
04:19:12.830 --> 04:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
deployed for decades other billionaires
 
04:19:15.389 --> 04:19:15.399 align:start position:0%
like George Soros Jeff Bezos are also on
 
04:19:17.469 --> 04:19:17.479 align:start position:0%
board with these plans openly I have
 
04:19:18.830 --> 04:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
provided you with printouts from
 
04:19:21.710 --> 04:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
articles of both forwards. time.com both
 
04:19:23.109 --> 04:19:23.119 align:start position:0%
very mainstream sources that are
 
04:19:24.790 --> 04:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
reporting on this links to the articles
 
04:19:26.790 --> 04:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
are in your handout just because our
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
military and federal government is
 
04:19:29.630 --> 04:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
saying that they are not doing it does
 
04:19:31.269 --> 04:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
not mean they are not doing it through
 
04:19:32.830 --> 04:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
the Freedom of Information Act many
 
04:19:34.550 --> 04:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
government secret missions have been
 
04:19:36.670 --> 04:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
withheld from public scrutiny have now
 
04:19:39.030 --> 04:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
now uh been released I have included in
 
04:19:40.469 --> 04:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
your handout two articles that were
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
published in the New York Times one of
 
04:19:44.229 --> 04:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
which was published on the front page of
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
this mainstream newspaper back in July
 
04:19:49.550 --> 04:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
3rd of 1972 both these articles report
 
04:19:51.189 --> 04:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
on the fact that the United States Air
 
04:19:53.109 --> 04:19:53.119 align:start position:0%
Force sprayed chemicals in Vietnam to
 
04:19:55.510 --> 04:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
increase rainfall this one secret of
 
04:19:57.830 --> 04:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
mission was known as operation papey
 
04:19:59.630 --> 04:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
both articles confirm cloud seating have
 
04:20:01.469 --> 04:20:01.479 align:start position:0%
been successfully used as a weapon by
 
04:20:03.670 --> 04:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
the US military also included in your
 
04:20:06.189 --> 04:20:06.199 align:start position:0%
handouts are two pages over 53 page
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%

the top of your handout there have been
 
04:20:44.309 --> 04:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
efforts by brave men such as Dennis
 
04:20:45.830 --> 04:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
kinage former Cleveland Mayor
 
04:20:47.510 --> 04:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
congressman and former campaign manager
 
04:20:49.349 --> 04:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
for Robert F Kennedy who I've had the
 
04:20:51.189 --> 04:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
pleasure of meeting as well as thanking
 
04:20:52.710 --> 04:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
him for his efforts of trying to stop
 
04:20:54.790 --> 04:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
this madness of spraying our skies the
 
04:20:56.950 --> 04:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
bill he put forth in Congress 23 years
 
04:21:00.710 --> 04:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
ago was known as HR 2977 also known as
 
04:21:03.070 --> 04:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
the space preservation act this bill
 
04:21:04.790 --> 04:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
mentions Chemtrails a term synonymous
 
04:21:07.510 --> 04:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
with geoengineering in section 7 B the
 
04:21:10.149 --> 04:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
categories are that categorizes them as
 
04:21:12.429 --> 04:21:12.439 align:start position:0%
exotic weapon systems also listed in the
 
04:21:14.189 --> 04:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
same section in chemicals biological
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
environmental climate tectonic weapons
 
04:21:18.269 --> 04:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
which are also which he also sought to
 
04:21:20.830 --> 04:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
ban with no avail while I do understand
 
04:21:22.109 --> 04:21:22.119 align:start position:0%
the intended use for weather
 
04:21:24.590 --> 04:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
modification during wartime used in
 
04:21:27.189 --> 04:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
Vietnam I nor you should you accept the
 
04:21:29.389 --> 04:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
such technology on the use of the people
 
04:21:31.109 --> 04:21:31.119 align:start position:0%
United States by your own government
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
without allowing the people to write to
 
04:21:34.670 --> 04:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
vote whether or not we want to be uh
 
04:21:37.550 --> 04:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
sprayed or or have our weather modified
 
04:21:39.670 --> 04:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
or whether we want our sun blocked out
 
04:21:41.030 --> 04:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you if you can read the rest of my
 
04:21:42.790 --> 04:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
testimony and if I have any minutes left
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
over I would like to finish uh my
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
testimony well I have two problems one
 
04:21:50.109 --> 04:21:50.119 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of people who want to
 
04:21:52.710 --> 04:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
testify that's my there time all my
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
second problem is that you have spoken
 
04:21:56.349 --> 04:21:56.359 align:start position:0%
for three minutes and you have never
 
04:21:59.030 --> 04:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned the bill we're here to get
 
04:22:01.469 --> 04:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
information about the efficacy of the
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
legislation before us it's right here on
 
04:22:06.750 --> 04:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
your on your we're not interested in uh
 
04:22:09.590 --> 04:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh hearing about things that may or may
 
04:22:12.109 --> 04:22:12.119 align:start position:0%
not be happening outside the world we're
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
here to talk about Prov B it's not may
 
04:22:16.710 --> 04:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
or may not be happening if you look this
 
04:22:18.429 --> 04:22:18.439 align:start position:0%
is exactly if you don't want to talk
 
04:22:20.550 --> 04:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
about the bill or any of the other
 
04:22:22.910 --> 04:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
people who are going to follow you then
 
04:22:25.269 --> 04:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to gavel you as out of
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
order because we're here to talk about
 
04:22:28.349 --> 04:22:28.359 align:start position:0%
the bill I am I if if you allow me to
 
04:22:29.710 --> 04:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
finish when I come back I will talk
 
04:22:31.030 --> 04:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
about I do not want you to finish thank
 
04:22:33.030 --> 04:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
you I think we've heard enough that's
 
04:22:36.070 --> 04:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
very unfair no it isn't it's the rules
 
04:22:38.950 --> 04:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
of that the house that we are here to
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
get information about bills okay that's
 
04:22:43.910 --> 04:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
what we're here for this is information
 
04:22:45.429 --> 04:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
I just urge all of you to please look
 
04:22:46.790 --> 04:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
through this carefully because it
 
04:22:50.149 --> 04:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
provides absolute and un total
 
04:22:52.870 --> 04:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
proof next I'll call on
 
04:22:58.630 --> 04:22:58.640 align:start position:0%

remarks to the substance of the bill
before

04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%

as a mother and human being I'm
 
04:23:31.990 --> 04:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
especially conscious about keeping
 
04:23:34.670 --> 04:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
pollutants out of our water soil and air
 
04:23:36.269 --> 04:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
I go to Great Lengths to ensure that
 
04:23:38.030 --> 04:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
that the food I raise for our family and
 
04:23:40.510 --> 04:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
Community is without contaminants it is
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
urgent that the clean atmosphere
 
04:23:43.790 --> 04:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
preservation Act passed in order to
 
04:23:45.630 --> 04:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire's air water and
 
04:23:48.630 --> 04:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
soil for people wildlife and
 
04:23:50.870 --> 04:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
agriculture the congressionally mandated
 
04:23:52.750 --> 04:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
research plan document that you have
 
04:23:54.590 --> 04:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
there on page six describes the
 
04:23:56.790 --> 04:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
deployment excuse me development of a
 
04:23:59.349 --> 04:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
government framework for SRM solar
 
04:24:01.710 --> 04:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
radiation modification experimentation
 
04:24:04.469 --> 04:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
such as stratospheric aerosol injections
 
04:24:07.229 --> 04:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
sa the report States that SRM would
 
04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
affect other aspects of the physical
 
04:24:10.950 --> 04:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
environment besides climate such as
 
04:24:13.389 --> 04:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
primary productivity due to land
 
04:24:15.510 --> 04:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
degradation erosion of soil loss of
 
04:24:17.550 --> 04:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
nutrients and biodiversity all
 
04:24:20.149 --> 04:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
indicators of environmental health it's
 
04:24:21.870 --> 04:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
important to note that the US is not a
 
04:24:23.790 --> 04:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
signatory to the 2010 treaty on
 
04:24:26.710 --> 04:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
biodiversity signed by over 190 Nations
 
04:24:29.349 --> 04:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
which ban Geo engineering deployment the
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
treaty which remains in place was cited
 
04:24:33.950 --> 04:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
in Mexico's ban to solar geoengineering
 
04:24:37.870 --> 04:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
last year unfortunately our 12 F1
 
04:24:39.950 --> 04:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
weather modification experimentation law
 
04:24:41.950 --> 04:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
allows experimentation in the techniques
 
04:24:43.950 --> 04:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
and methods for weather modification
 
04:24:46.950 --> 04:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
this law must be repealed page 15 of the
 
04:24:48.670 --> 04:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
Congressional document tells us that a
 
04:24:50.910 --> 04:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
variety of unintended outcomes of SRM
 
04:24:53.030 --> 04:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
are not well understood and there may be
 
04:24:55.389 --> 04:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
others of which we're not aware
 
04:24:58.429 --> 04:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
including among many sea level rise
 
04:25:01.389 --> 04:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
patterns of climate variability ocean
 
04:25:04.030 --> 04:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
acidification effect to coral reefs crft
 
04:25:06.990 --> 04:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
production and ecosystems excuse me yes
 
04:25:08.950 --> 04:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
could you speak about the bill that's
 
04:25:08.960 --> 04:25:10.429 align:start position:0%
could you speak about the bill that's
before

04:25:10.429 --> 04:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:25:12.790 --> 04:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
us I really appreciate that's all
 
04:25:15.309 --> 04:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
directly related and important in
 
04:25:18.630 --> 04:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
context with the bill sir but our job in
 
04:25:21.229 --> 04:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
this committee is to to decide whether
 
04:25:23.670 --> 04:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
or not the bill that's before us can
 
04:25:26.750 --> 04:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
effectively deal with the problem and
 
04:25:28.990 --> 04:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
unless you address how the bill can do
 
04:25:32.309 --> 04:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
that then we we can't know whether the
 
04:25:35.349 --> 04:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
bill is good or bad well it seems to me
 
04:25:39.229 --> 04:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
if I may that the current policy allows
 
04:25:44.950 --> 04:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
for just about anyone it seems if you if
 
04:25:51.429 --> 04:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
I may the um in cooperation with the
 
04:25:53.070 --> 04:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
federal government authorized agencies
 
04:25:54.550 --> 04:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
of other states and with interested
 
04:25:56.870 --> 04:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
persons and organizations it mentions
 
04:26:00.750 --> 04:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
gifts it mentions um donations it's very
 
04:26:04.590 --> 04:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
very vague as to who and how this could
 
04:26:07.309 --> 04:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
come into play over our in New Hampshire
 
04:26:09.710 --> 04:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
the policy is that we have currently it
 
04:26:12.670 --> 04:26:12.680 align:start position:0%
is so vague and frankly dangerous and I
 
04:26:14.389 --> 04:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
don't think that this is serving our our
 
04:26:17.269 --> 04:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire and Beyond so
 
04:26:20.349 --> 04:26:20.359 align:start position:0%
how does the bill help that situation it
 
04:26:29.309 --> 04:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:32.070 --> 04:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
for could you describe things in the
 
04:26:34.630 --> 04:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
bill that you say will solve this
 
04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
problem I can but I feel that uh
 
04:26:41.710 --> 04:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
Representatives Pensa and Gard did a a
 
04:26:44.389 --> 04:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
fine job of presenting that last week
 
04:26:46.309 --> 04:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
and I know you've all had the chance to
 
04:26:47.990 --> 04:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
take a look at the details with that
 
04:26:50.389 --> 04:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
bill um I I would appreciate actually
 
04:26:51.469 --> 04:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
being able to read at least the
 
04:26:53.229 --> 04:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
conclusion of my
 
04:26:55.590 --> 04:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
testimony well your three month three
 
04:26:57.670 --> 04:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
minute time limit is up so I understand
 
04:26:59.510 --> 04:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
that but you did interrupt to to I'll
 
04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:06.149 --> 04:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
you if we stand back and allow
 
04:27:08.870 --> 04:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
modification SRM and SII to move forward
 
04:27:10.469 --> 04:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
there will be no such thing as organic
 
04:27:13.070 --> 04:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
food no clean air and no healthy soil
 
04:27:15.269 --> 04:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
that's our
 
04:27:18.349 --> 04:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
consent solar engineering solar
 
04:27:19.950 --> 04:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
geoengineering and SII weather
 
04:27:21.630 --> 04:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
modification are clearly hazardous to
 
04:27:23.070 --> 04:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
our health to Wildlife and our
 
04:27:24.870 --> 04:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
environment future Generations are
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
relying on us to protect our world from
 
04:27:28.670 --> 04:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
pollution I urge each of you on this
 
04:27:30.670 --> 04:27:30.680 align:start position:0%
committee to move this bill forward
 
04:27:30.680 --> 04:27:31.590 align:start position:0%
committee to move this bill forward
thank

04:27:31.590 --> 04:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:27:34.910 --> 04:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much we appreciate
 
04:27:34.920 --> 04:27:36.510 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much we appreciate
that

04:27:36.510 --> 04:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:27:41.309 --> 04:27:41.319 align:start position:0%
okay next up is Lisa Lipkin from Hancock
 
04:27:44.269 --> 04:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire representing Clear Blue
 
04:27:48.429 --> 04:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
Skies New Hampshire oh sort of or myself
 
04:27:50.429 --> 04:27:50.439 align:start position:0%
oh I'm Gonna Give You My Testimony after
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
just for the sake of time I guess there
 
04:27:54.309 --> 04:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
is no organization called Clear Blue
 
04:27:58.030 --> 04:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
Skies New Hampshire it's forming okay um
 
04:28:01.790 --> 04:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
so please tell us uh how this bill can
 
04:28:04.269 --> 04:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
solve the problem that you seek to solve
 
04:28:06.830 --> 04:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
well I would also like just go briefly
 
04:28:09.870 --> 04:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
through my testimony um and I wanted
 
04:28:11.510 --> 04:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
because the conversation is really about
 
04:28:13.670 --> 04:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
governance of geoengineering and weather
 
04:28:15.510 --> 04:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
modification and you you'll hear a
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
testimony if you you look at this
 
04:28:19.349 --> 04:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
document you know that our government
 
04:28:21.950 --> 04:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
has already created a plan for how this
 
04:28:24.070 --> 04:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
is going to be governed and I just want
 
04:28:25.630 --> 04:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
to say that our government this is
 
04:28:28.109 --> 04:28:28.119 align:start position:0%
context for the bill our government has
 
04:28:31.630 --> 04:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
a track record of experimenting on its
 
04:28:33.870 --> 04:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
people without their consent or even
 
04:28:35.550 --> 04:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
their knowledge you certainly know about
 
04:28:37.950 --> 04:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
the Tuskegee experiments maybe you know
 
04:28:40.229 --> 04:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
about the Cold Spring Harbor Eugenics
 
04:28:43.309 --> 04:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
experiments and directly related to this
 
04:28:45.630 --> 04:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that during the 1950s
 
04:28:47.269 --> 04:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
under the guise of protecting us from
 
04:28:49.590 --> 04:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
the Cold War threat of nuclear war the
 
04:28:51.670 --> 04:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
United States Army I'm going to leave
 
04:28:53.910 --> 04:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
out the details of the names and
 
04:28:55.189 --> 04:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
everything it's called The Manhattan
 
04:28:58.189 --> 04:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
Rochester Coalition we're spraying zinc
 
04:29:01.630 --> 04:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
cadmium sulfide out of c117 planes that
 
04:29:03.950 --> 04:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
flew from California to Washington and
 
04:29:06.630 --> 04:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
literally sprinkled Radioactive zinc
 
04:29:09.109 --> 04:29:09.119 align:start position:0%
cadmium sulfide across the American
 
04:29:11.910 --> 04:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
Across America focusing on the cities it
 
04:29:15.149 --> 04:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
was done with certainly no oversight um
 
04:29:17.349 --> 04:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
this was done in the 50s to the 70s and
 
04:29:18.710 --> 04:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
yet it was not admitted by the
 
04:29:21.030 --> 04:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
government until 2008 when the truth
 
04:29:23.590 --> 04:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
came out after many many deaths so yes
 
04:29:25.830 --> 04:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
the military was spraying radioactive
 
04:29:29.830 --> 04:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
chemicals on an unsuspecting public to
 
04:29:33.070 --> 04:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
research aerosol behavior in cities here
 
04:29:34.429 --> 04:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
we have the same thing we have our
 
04:29:37.910 --> 04:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
government saying that they are going to
 
04:29:37.920 --> 04:29:38.910 align:start position:0%
government saying that they are going to
do

04:29:38.910 --> 04:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:29:42.950 --> 04:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
experimental research on us and we have
 
04:29:45.790 --> 04:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
no say that's the bottom line legitimate
 
04:29:48.790 --> 04:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
governance requires the consent of the
 
04:29:51.229 --> 04:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
Govern of the Govern and as has been
 
04:29:52.710 --> 04:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
pointed out in the state of New
 
04:29:55.309 --> 04:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is basically allowed free
 
04:29:56.950 --> 04:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
reign I'm not going to repeat the the
 
04:29:59.309 --> 04:29:59.319 align:start position:0%
bill you guys know it um what it does
 
04:30:01.870 --> 04:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
say is that they um anyone who's going
 
04:30:03.990 --> 04:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
to engage in weather modification has to
 
04:30:07.189 --> 04:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
disclose to the public disclosure is not
 
04:30:09.229 --> 04:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
consent It also says they have to
 
04:30:12.030 --> 04:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
solicit public opinion public soliciting
 
04:30:15.870 --> 04:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
public opinion is not consent HB 1700
 
04:30:18.109 --> 04:30:18.119 align:start position:0%
must be enacted in order to protect the
 
04:30:20.950 --> 04:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
people environment of this state you
 
04:30:23.269 --> 04:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
sitting in those chairs for Better or
 
04:30:25.830 --> 04:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
For Worse are The Gatekeepers your
 
04:30:27.750 --> 04:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
decision making is of monumental
 
04:30:30.510 --> 04:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
consequence and many many eyes are on
 
04:30:32.550 --> 04:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
these hearings not just in New Hampshire
 
04:30:34.109 --> 04:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
but all around the country and all
 
04:30:36.070 --> 04:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
around the world legit legitimate
 
04:30:38.990 --> 04:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
governance requires the consent of the
 
04:30:41.910 --> 04:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
Govern please hear us loud and clear we
 
04:30:45.830 --> 04:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
do not consent to this Reckless arrogant
 
04:30:48.229 --> 04:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
experimental uh experimentation with
 
04:30:50.309 --> 04:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
complex natural systems upon which all
 
04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
life depends it is upon this body to
 
04:30:55.070 --> 04:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
stand in the way of this going forward
 
04:30:56.830 --> 04:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire if this
 
04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
bill isn't perfect I know that
 
04:31:01.870 --> 04:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
representative Penza and repres
 
04:31:03.790 --> 04:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
representative Gearhart will work with
 
04:31:05.750 --> 04:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
you to tweak it and make it as good as
 
04:31:08.550 --> 04:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
possible and as Ironclad as possible and
 
04:31:10.630 --> 04:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
by the way one last quick thing to the
 
04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
person who mentioned CO2 last year last
 
04:31:16.389 --> 04:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
year last week saying CO2 everybody
 
04:31:18.590 --> 04:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
knows that CO2 is the cause of climate
 
04:31:21.030 --> 04:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
change well I'd like to introduce you to
 
04:31:23.710 --> 04:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
Dr Willie soon he is an astrophysicist
 
04:31:26.309 --> 04:31:26.319 align:start position:0%
and a geoscientist based in SAA
 
04:31:29.469 --> 04:31:29.479 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and he said CO2 is the gas
 
04:31:32.349 --> 04:31:32.359 align:start position:0%
of Life carbon dioxide is absolutely
 
04:31:34.630 --> 04:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
essential for plant growth and all of
 
04:31:37.469 --> 04:31:37.479 align:start position:0%
life volumes of research clearly
 
04:31:40.469 --> 04:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that crop Garden Forest Etc
 
04:31:43.590 --> 04:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
want more CO2 not less I in my testimony
 
04:31:45.469 --> 04:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
you can look him up you can look up the
 
04:31:47.229 --> 04:31:47.239 align:start position:0%
hundreds of scientists that he's working
 
04:31:49.429 --> 04:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
with this isn't it's not a joke it's not
 
04:31:51.590 --> 04:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
a conspiracy theorist and it's Theory
 
04:31:52.870 --> 04:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
and it's not something you all want to
 
04:31:54.950 --> 04:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
poo poo because it's affecting you all
 
04:31:57.830 --> 04:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
your children your loved ones and
 
04:31:59.510 --> 04:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
everybody that you say you care about
 
04:32:01.149 --> 04:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
and that's my testimony thank you for
 
04:32:04.750 --> 04:32:04.760 align:start position:0%

for SRM geoengineering experimentation
 
04:33:15.230 --> 04:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
this governance framework does not
 
04:33:16.830 --> 04:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
include any input from the people of New
 
04:33:19.230 --> 04:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and our elected legislators we
 
04:33:20.750 --> 04:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire do not
 
04:33:23.670 --> 04:33:23.680 align:start position:0%

04:33:25.269 --> 04:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
Congressional mandates or federal
 
04:33:29.590 --> 04:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
governance of SRM activities page 43
 
04:33:31.390 --> 04:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
paragraph two of that document says the
 
04:33:33.470 --> 04:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
federal government conducts or funds
 
04:33:36.150 --> 04:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
limited Research into SRM Congress has
 
04:33:39.869 --> 04:33:39.879 align:start position:0%
directed NOAA to fund SRM research as
 
04:33:42.029 --> 04:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
part of its Earth Earth's radiation
 
04:33:43.429 --> 04:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
budget program for the last several
 
04:33:44.629 --> 04:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
years this supports several
 
04:33:46.830 --> 04:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
observational and modeling activities in
 
04:33:50.429 --> 04:33:50.439 align:start position:0%
Noah NASA and with partner organizations
 
04:33:52.869 --> 04:33:52.879 align:start position:0%
like the university um university
 
04:33:54.750 --> 04:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
Corporation for atmospheric research
 
04:33:57.150 --> 04:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
Noah Cooperative institutes blah blah
 
04:33:59.269 --> 04:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch according to New
 
04:34:02.670 --> 04:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state law 12- F1 whether
 
04:34:05.029 --> 04:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
modification experimentation is legal in
 
04:34:07.789 --> 04:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
our great state the law states any
 
04:34:10.269 --> 04:34:10.279 align:start position:0%
department or agency of the state may
 
04:34:11.830 --> 04:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
with the approval of the governor and
 
04:34:14.070 --> 04:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
Council and within the limits of
 
04:34:16.150 --> 04:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
appropriated funds or by means of gifts
 
04:34:18.269 --> 04:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
donations or grants as already has been
 
04:34:21.070 --> 04:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
discussed engage in and undertake
 
04:34:23.109 --> 04:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
experimentation in the techniques and
 
04:34:25.629 --> 04:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
methods for weather modification and may
 
04:34:27.189 --> 04:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
cooperate therein with the federal
 
04:34:29.150 --> 04:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
government with authorized agencies of
 
04:34:30.869 --> 04:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
other states and with interested persons
 
04:34:33.470 --> 04:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
and organizations it's clearly written
 
04:34:35.750 --> 04:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
anyone can do this the last last line of
 
04:34:38.510 --> 04:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
the law line C says the state will
 
04:34:40.750 --> 04:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
solicit public input regarding the
 
04:34:42.629 --> 04:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
proposed weather modification program or
 
04:34:44.670 --> 04:34:44.680 align:start position:0%
experimentation soliciting public input
 
04:34:47.510 --> 04:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
does not equal public consent consent of
 
04:34:50.189 --> 04:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
the government governed is a require is
 
04:34:52.869 --> 04:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
a requirement in a free Society it must
 
04:34:56.869 --> 04:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
be state law 12- F1 must be repealed in
 
04:35:00.590 --> 04:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
its entirety and HB 1700 would do
 
04:35:03.230 --> 04:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
that again I'll I'll skip some of this
 
04:35:06.029 --> 04:35:06.039 align:start position:0%
because you can read part of it but uh
 
04:35:09.470 --> 04:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
we do not consent to SRM SI or any other
 
04:35:09.480 --> 04:35:11.230 align:start position:0%
we do not consent to SRM SI or any other
atmospheric

04:35:11.230 --> 04:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
atmospheric
 
04:35:13.629 --> 04:35:13.639 align:start position:0%
experimentation and as Lisa said the
 
04:35:15.310 --> 04:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
whole world is watching this I've gotten
 
04:35:18.310 --> 04:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
texts from people in Europe I've gotten
 
04:35:21.551 --> 04:35:21.561 align:start position:0%
I've Got Friends in California and Ohio
 
04:35:23.910 --> 04:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
and down in Florida they're all watching
 
04:35:25.510 --> 04:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
this they want New Hampshire to be first
 
04:35:30.629 --> 04:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
in the nation and um please pass HB 1700
 
04:35:30.639 --> 04:35:31.629 align:start position:0%
in the nation and um please pass HB 1700
thank

04:35:31.629 --> 04:35:31.639 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
04:35:36.990 --> 04:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
much next up
 
04:35:51.590 --> 04:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:54.070 --> 04:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
chipone I gave you all a puck just to
 
04:35:55.551 --> 04:35:55.561 align:start position:0%
have because there's a lot of tension in
 
04:35:59.269 --> 04:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
here and uh bipolar politics is kind of
 
04:36:01.629 --> 04:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
not not helpful to anybody but uh I
 
04:36:03.629 --> 04:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
agree with a lot of the testimony I'm
 
04:36:05.629 --> 04:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
sorry oh
 
04:36:08.109 --> 04:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
okay sorry I agree with a lot of the
 
04:36:11.629 --> 04:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
testimony and uh I submitted one um well
 
04:36:13.349 --> 04:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
I submitted four days of spraying over
 
04:36:16.189 --> 04:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
my home in Salem New Hampshire um
 
04:36:17.990 --> 04:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
noticing the skies are going from Blue
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
to gray um there's definitely something
 
04:36:22.789 --> 04:36:22.799 align:start position:0%
going on and there is it is legal um I
 
04:36:24.150 --> 04:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
believe it was made legal because
 
04:36:26.310 --> 04:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
someone invented a way a New Hampshire
 
04:36:28.590 --> 04:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
resident invented a way to Cloud seed
 
04:36:30.390 --> 04:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
with some kind of a gun so they modified
 
04:36:33.109 --> 04:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
the law to protect a local entrepreneur
 
04:36:34.269 --> 04:36:34.279 align:start position:0%
I'm an entrepreneur and this is
 
04:36:35.789 --> 04:36:35.799 align:start position:0%
something I designed and hopefully we
 
04:36:38.670 --> 04:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
can come together as a as a people and
 
04:36:40.269 --> 04:36:40.279 align:start position:0%
uh help each other's health I mean I'm
 
04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
not going to get into this too much I
 
04:36:45.070 --> 04:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
mean you guys have your job to do here
 
04:36:46.830 --> 04:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
and everybody's kind of you know there's
 
04:36:48.789 --> 04:36:48.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of tension in here but uh I'd like
 
04:36:50.310 --> 04:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
to help educate you guys about any of
 
04:36:51.670 --> 04:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
this stuff you have interest I have a
 
04:36:53.310 --> 04:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
lot of knowledge of this technology and
 
04:36:54.670 --> 04:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
other Technologies we should be looking
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
at and protecting the health of our of
 
04:36:57.709 --> 04:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
our citizens that all I have that's all
 
04:36:59.949 --> 04:36:59.959 align:start position:0%
I have to say any questions I'd be happy
 
04:37:02.551 --> 04:37:02.561 align:start position:0%
to answer them thank you for your time

04:38:11.830 --> 04:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:14.109 --> 04:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Kimberly Lis
 
04:38:16.230 --> 04:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm in Hillsboro New Hampshire thank
 
04:38:17.990 --> 04:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
you for volunteering on the subcommittee
 
04:38:19.349 --> 04:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
and having an open discussion with
 
04:38:20.590 --> 04:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
concerned people of New Hampshire
 
04:38:21.949 --> 04:38:21.959 align:start position:0%
regarding the clean atmosphere
 
04:38:21.959 --> 04:38:28.189 align:start position:0%
regarding the clean atmosphere
preservation

04:38:28.189 --> 04:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:30.150 --> 04:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
act oh
 
04:38:34.269 --> 04:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
jeez okay um anyway um I'm in support of
 
04:38:39.189 --> 04:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
house bill 1700 FN the reasons are many
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
um there is no agreed upon policy for
 
04:38:45.551 --> 04:38:45.561 align:start position:0%
governance concerning the atmosphere at
 
04:38:48.869 --> 04:38:48.879 align:start position:0%
this point um we are not the only people
 
04:38:50.869 --> 04:38:50.879 align:start position:0%
that are discussing this at this time
 
04:38:52.310 --> 04:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
all over the nation and in other
 
04:38:55.429 --> 04:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
countries as well there's discussion um
 
04:38:57.551 --> 04:38:57.561 align:start position:0%
regarding governance and how to go about
 
04:39:00.390 --> 04:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
it making decisions because they don't
 
04:39:03.670 --> 04:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
know what the possible outcomes are of
 
04:39:05.629 --> 04:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
spraying um
 
04:39:07.830 --> 04:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
so there's there's unknown risks they
 
04:39:10.029 --> 04:39:10.039 align:start position:0%
just don't
 
04:39:15.269 --> 04:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
be okay um so I don't want to go through
 
04:39:20.551 --> 04:39:20.561 align:start position:0%
all of this um there's a lot of
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
particles that they're studying if you
 
04:39:24.910 --> 04:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
look anything up I have linked um the
 
04:39:27.590 --> 04:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
White House um had a mandated report on
 
04:39:30.990 --> 04:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
solar radiation modification so they are
 
04:39:32.470 --> 04:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
whether they're testing now or not
 
04:39:34.109 --> 04:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter they are going to
 
04:39:35.990 --> 04:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
test that's why this report was written
 
04:39:38.230 --> 04:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
and there are many many reports written
 
04:39:43.190 --> 04:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
about governance about uh SRM um so it's
 
04:39:45.590 --> 04:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
going to happen it's in their it's in
 
04:39:49.628 --> 04:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
their um documents that they need to be
 
04:39:53.470 --> 04:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
able to have outdoor experiments um and
 
04:39:56.070 --> 04:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
so by enacting this bill we could be
 
04:40:00.070 --> 04:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
Sovereign over our land our Waters our
 
04:40:02.350 --> 04:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
air um it
 
04:40:06.830 --> 04:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
will it'll help to preserve our soil um
 
04:40:09.310 --> 04:40:09.320 align:start position:0%
I do some farming I have a small farm as
 
04:40:13.948 --> 04:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
well um and the the soil is becoming
 
04:40:16.590 --> 04:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
toxic anyway and if they were to do
 
04:40:19.230 --> 04:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
these experiments using um Nano
 
04:40:22.550 --> 04:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
particles like aluminum which has um I
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
have it written on here you can see the
 
04:40:27.788 --> 04:40:27.798 align:start position:0%
links um they're nanop particles and
 
04:40:30.830 --> 04:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
they can go into your body very easily
 
04:40:32.430 --> 04:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
because they're so minute they can go
 
04:40:33.868 --> 04:40:33.878 align:start position:0%
through your eyes your nose right
 
04:40:35.990 --> 04:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
through your skin and they cause all
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
kinds of problems that's written in here
 
04:40:39.868 --> 04:40:39.878 align:start position:0%
and I've also made links that you can
 
04:40:42.030 --> 04:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
look them up
 
04:40:44.590 --> 04:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
um they're they're they're really
 
04:40:46.190 --> 04:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
looking and when you try to look stuff
 
04:40:48.310 --> 04:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
up to what they're possibly going to do
 
04:40:50.550 --> 04:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
it they just name particles particles
 
04:40:51.990 --> 04:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to actually get the
 
04:40:54.868 --> 04:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
list of what they actually want to do so
 
04:40:58.150 --> 04:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
I think it's very important that we we
 
04:41:02.230 --> 04:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
go ahead and this is a a great bill um I
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
think it protects everybody our future
 
04:41:08.550 --> 04:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire our economy um
 
04:41:11.190 --> 04:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
because you don't know what kind of
 
04:41:13.350 --> 04:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
health problems this is even going to
 
04:41:15.708 --> 04:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
cost um if we allow this to happen and
 
04:41:17.910 --> 04:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
there was an accidental iron
 
04:41:21.030 --> 04:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
fertilization of the um Pacific Ocean in
 
04:41:24.110 --> 04:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
2012 that someone just dumped tons of
 
04:41:26.948 --> 04:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
iron in the ocean to try to get Plankton
 
04:41:29.708 --> 04:41:29.718 align:start position:0%
or whatever to grow to eat the oxygen um
 
04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
they're trying to experiment right now
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
um Harvard I think I put a link in here
 
04:41:36.550 --> 04:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
about Harvard's experiment that they
 
04:41:38.470 --> 04:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
would like to run as well so whether
 
04:41:39.750 --> 04:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
they're doing it or not they're going to
 
04:41:41.788 --> 04:41:41.798 align:start position:0%
do it and I think this is very very
 
04:41:43.390 --> 04:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
important legislation to keep our
 
04:41:46.948 --> 04:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
sovereignty over our skies our
 
04:41:50.150 --> 04:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
atmosphere our water our soil to protect
 
04:41:52.390 --> 04:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
the health of all the life here in New
 
04:41:56.070 --> 04:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as much as we possibly can um
 
04:41:58.190 --> 04:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
with that there's a bunch of um links on
 
04:42:00.868 --> 04:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
here that you can look stuff up I almost
 
04:42:03.750 --> 04:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
went blind reading all this stuff it's
 
04:42:05.430 --> 04:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
horrible to read
 
04:42:07.670 --> 04:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
but I think it would be really good idea
 
04:42:09.270 --> 04:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
if you would really look into it it's
 
04:42:12.350 --> 04:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
not a conspiracy theorist Theory um the
 
04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
Army and the government working with
 
04:42:16.470 --> 04:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
local officials I wrote that in here as
 
04:42:19.070 --> 04:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
well they actually already conducted
 
04:42:20.590 --> 04:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
experiments on humans without their
 
04:42:23.830 --> 04:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge so we don't we don't consent
 
04:42:27.230 --> 04:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
to this experimentation that one's for
 
04:42:29.550 --> 04:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you very much we
 
04:42:29.560 --> 04:42:31.948 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you very much we
appreciate

04:42:31.948 --> 04:42:31.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
04:42:35.150 --> 04:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
it next up is our
 
04:42:38.470 --> 04:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
Linda McWilliams of Hillsboro and on
 
04:42:44.310 --> 04:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:54.910 --> 04:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:59.430 --> 04:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
but okay um I'm now is Linda MC Williams
 
04:43:01.628 --> 04:43:01.638 align:start position:0%
thank all of you folks for being here
 
04:43:03.708 --> 04:43:03.718 align:start position:0%
today to listen to the concerns of the
 
04:43:07.030 --> 04:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
people that you each volunteered um to
 
04:43:11.030 --> 04:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
serve as our agents and substitutes in
 
04:43:14.310 --> 04:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
um in our government um my understanding
 
04:43:16.070 --> 04:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
from what I was taught in school is that
 
04:43:18.350 --> 04:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
the purpose of government is to secure
 
04:43:22.948 --> 04:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:26.310 --> 04:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
um and I think that does not only do I
 
04:43:28.510 --> 04:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
believe that that includes the right not
 
04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
to be experimented on without
 
04:43:35.670 --> 04:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
prior legally effective fully informed
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
consent free of any pressure whatsoever
 
04:43:42.310 --> 04:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
that is um that principle is
 
04:43:45.030 --> 04:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
incorporated a number of uh federal and
 
04:43:47.470 --> 04:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
state uh statutes including the national
 
04:43:50.430 --> 04:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
research Act and the Belmont report
 
04:43:53.150 --> 04:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
which incorporates and expands on the
 
04:43:58.310 --> 04:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
principles in the uh nurg code um I'd
 
04:44:00.868 --> 04:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
also like to point out I mean you guys
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
have heard a lot already and you know
 
04:44:05.070 --> 04:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
contrary to that line from movie instead
 
04:44:08.070 --> 04:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
of don't look up look up any of us
 
04:44:10.190 --> 04:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
who've been around for more than a
 
04:44:12.390 --> 04:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
couple of decades can remember the
 
04:44:15.070 --> 04:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
difference between a true contrail and
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
there's ample documentation on this
 
04:44:21.550 --> 04:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
which is um you know simply condensation
 
04:44:23.310 --> 04:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
of water vapor behind a plane that
 
04:44:28.390 --> 04:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
disappears within seconds as my um my
 
04:44:31.750 --> 04:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
significant other who's a pilot my uncle
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
two uncles one who graduated with Aunt
 
04:44:36.110 --> 04:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
Hors from the Air Force Academy and many
 
04:44:40.110 --> 04:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
others can uh can attest to um
 
04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:51.150 --> 04:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
referring more than once to the historic
 
04:44:53.190 --> 04:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
context for
 
04:44:57.190 --> 04:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
certain um you know regarding certain uh
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
aspects of our
 
04:45:04.470 --> 04:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution and um whether or not uh
 
04:45:09.230 --> 04:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
ious laws infringe on the rights that
 
04:45:12.190 --> 04:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
are protected by the Constitution or not
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
and um in terms of the historic context
 
04:45:20.430 --> 04:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
they refer to what was the tradition and
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
the practice at the time that our
 
04:45:25.948 --> 04:45:25.958 align:start position:0%
Federation of States was founded and
 
04:45:29.310 --> 04:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
when our constitution was written and
 
04:45:33.070 --> 04:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
ratified at that time ownership of land
 
04:45:36.270 --> 04:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
included own ownership of the ground
 
04:45:39.030 --> 04:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
beneath the surface
 
04:45:43.590 --> 04:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
and the air above to
 
04:45:46.948 --> 04:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
Infinity um I do strongly in case you
 
04:45:51.470 --> 04:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
haven't guessed support um
 
04:45:51.480 --> 04:45:52.990 align:start position:0%
haven't guessed support um
hr700

04:45:52.990 --> 04:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
hr700
 
04:45:58.628 --> 04:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
FN um I believe that it does a superb
 
04:46:04.750 --> 04:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
job of if past of protecting the and
 
04:46:06.670 --> 04:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
other rights of the people of New
 
04:46:08.830 --> 04:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and their health and the
 
04:46:12.070 --> 04:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
environment that we are all dependent on
 
04:46:14.430 --> 04:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
on the CO2 one more comment how do we
 
04:46:17.390 --> 04:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
get the air that we breathe the plants
 
04:46:19.270 --> 04:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
take in
 
04:46:22.270 --> 04:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
CO2 use the energy of the sun combine it
 
04:46:24.190 --> 04:46:24.200 align:start position:0%

04:46:27.150 --> 04:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
the soil and nitrogen in some cases from
 
04:46:27.160 --> 04:46:28.390 align:start position:0%
the soil and nitrogen in some cases from
the

04:46:28.390 --> 04:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:46:32.310 --> 04:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
air they create carbohydrates and
 
04:46:35.750 --> 04:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
proteins and the byproduct is the air
 
04:46:38.750 --> 04:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
that we breathe so the whole idea of CO2
 
04:46:41.788 --> 04:46:41.798 align:start position:0%
being a um harmful element in the
 
04:46:44.350 --> 04:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
atmosphere seems to me
 
04:46:47.350 --> 04:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh like like a sad reflection on the
 
04:46:49.390 --> 04:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
state of uh education in the United
 
04:46:52.390 --> 04:46:52.400 align:start position:0%

enforcement officer and this unique
 
04:48:06.548 --> 04:48:06.558 align:start position:0%
background has provided me the skills of
 
04:48:09.310 --> 04:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
a lifelong and articulate investigator

with a keen scrutiny for
 
04:48:14.110 --> 04:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
details moreover I have protected the

approaching the honorable
 
04:48:22.230 --> 04:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
representatives of New Hampshire to

protect me my family my neighborhood and
 
04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
all of New Hampshire's citizens with the
 
04:48:29.150 --> 04:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
power you
 
04:48:32.030 --> 04:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
possess please help us cease and assist
 
04:48:34.510 --> 04:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
the pollution of our atmospheres by
 
04:48:36.750 --> 04:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the intentional release of
 
04:48:39.230 --> 04:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
polluting emissions known to occur
 
04:48:41.590 --> 04:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
during cloud seating weather
 
04:48:44.150 --> 04:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
modification solar radiation
 
04:48:47.070 --> 04:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
modification and Associated excessive
 
04:48:49.948 --> 04:48:49.958 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic microwave radiation and
 
04:48:52.990 --> 04:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
making penalties for violation of such
 
04:48:55.548 --> 04:48:55.558 align:start position:0%
prohibit there is much substantial
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
evidence that this practice is both
 
04:48:59.190 --> 04:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
ongoing and has been in place for
 
04:49:04.230 --> 04:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
decades our own RSA 12f colon 1 weather
 
04:49:06.830 --> 04:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
modification experimentation that was
 
04:49:08.110 --> 04:49:08.120 align:start position:0%
enacted in
 
04:49:11.030 --> 04:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
1985 clearly and succinctly states that
 
04:49:13.190 --> 04:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
weather modification is known and
 
04:49:15.430 --> 04:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
moreover the weather modification has
 
04:49:18.430 --> 04:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
been ongoing and being conducted without
 
04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
the people's
 
04:49:23.548 --> 04:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
consent regarding 12f colon 1 weather
 
04:49:25.910 --> 04:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
modification experimentation I will
 
04:49:28.270 --> 04:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
refer to the White House document named
 
04:49:31.628 --> 04:49:31.638 align:start position:0%
congressionally mandated research plan
 
04:49:33.510 --> 04:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
and an initial research governance
 
04:49:35.548 --> 04:49:35.558 align:start position:0%
framework work related to solar
 
04:49:35.558 --> 04:49:36.750 align:start position:0%
framework work related to solar
radiation

04:49:36.750 --> 04:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
04:49:39.030 --> 04:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
modification as it clearly states that
 
04:49:42.190 --> 04:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
the practice of weather modification is
 
04:49:45.670 --> 04:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
happening on page 43 of the document you
 
04:49:47.350 --> 04:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
will see the mention of
 
04:49:50.270 --> 04:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
saber also on this page you will see a
 
04:49:53.150 --> 04:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
list of the payload and which agency is
 
04:49:56.350 --> 04:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
supplying each note that the date of the
 
04:49:59.948 --> 04:49:59.958 align:start position:0%
document which is year 2022 and
 
04:50:03.270 --> 04:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
2023 I will also direct you to the 2024
 
04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
federal budget where millions of dollars
 
04:50:08.548 --> 04:50:08.558 align:start position:0%
have already been approved for years out
 
04:50:10.830 --> 04:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
in order to continue exposing all of us
 
04:50:13.510 --> 04:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
our animals our crops not to mention the
 
04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
wildlife to these polluting
 
04:50:17.670 --> 04:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
interventions and
 
04:50:20.350 --> 04:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
experiments the 10th Amendment of the
 
04:50:23.230 --> 04:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution of the United States states
 
04:50:25.868 --> 04:50:25.878 align:start position:0%
that most power and authority remains
 
04:50:28.390 --> 04:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
with the states either with the state
 
04:50:30.230 --> 04:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
governments or with the people
 
04:50:32.548 --> 04:50:32.558 align:start position:0%
themselves as they determine in each
 
04:50:35.868 --> 04:50:35.878 align:start position:0%
state the 10th amendment protects us
 
04:50:37.868 --> 04:50:37.878 align:start position:0%
from the federal government's
 
04:50:40.910 --> 04:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
overreach I have never given consent and
 
04:50:43.390 --> 04:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
moreover this entire State of New
 
04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire never gave consent to be
 
04:50:48.788 --> 04:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
exposed to this sort of pollution and
 
04:50:52.350 --> 04:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
experimentation House Bill 1700 is a
 
04:50:54.910 --> 04:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
simple matter of governance considering
 
04:50:59.150 --> 04:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire 12f is already in
 
04:51:01.548 --> 04:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
existence we are very fortunate to be
 
04:51:03.230 --> 04:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
living in the live free DI St pleas
 
04:51:07.150 --> 04:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
Please wrap up okay uh in in in closing
 
04:51:10.310 --> 04:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1700 is about pollution
 
04:51:13.150 --> 04:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
intentional pollution created to modify
 
04:51:16.510 --> 04:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
the weather consent that was never given
 
04:51:20.070 --> 04:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
and governments that must now be enacted
 
04:51:22.190 --> 04:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
I trust that all of us here want the
 
04:51:24.270 --> 04:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
protection that this bill gives us we
 
04:51:27.070 --> 04:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
must as a state come together and pass
 
04:51:30.310 --> 04:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1700 into law thank
 
04:51:33.430 --> 04:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you and thanks for the written
 
04:51:37.310 --> 04:51:37.320 align:start position:0%

name is Jani kumela um I go by Josie for
short

04:52:04.430 --> 04:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
short
 
04:52:06.350 --> 04:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm a resident of Manchester New
 
04:52:08.510 --> 04:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I've been born and raised
 
04:52:10.350 --> 04:52:10.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire my whole life this is
 
04:52:13.510 --> 04:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
my home the granite state and I love my
 
04:52:17.230 --> 04:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
home and um in response to your question
 
04:52:19.628 --> 04:52:19.638 align:start position:0%
I'm going to focus my testimony um
 
04:52:23.628 --> 04:52:23.638 align:start position:0%
specifically on what I support about HB
 
04:52:25.948 --> 04:52:25.958 align:start position:0%
1700 um and I would like to direct your
 
04:52:29.470 --> 04:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
attention to line nine um where it talks
 
04:52:32.030 --> 04:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
about the departmental notice to cease
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
federal or foreign approved program
 
04:52:36.948 --> 04:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
programs um the bill states that where
 
04:52:38.868 --> 04:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
an activity that the Department of
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services has deemed
 
04:52:42.948 --> 04:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
hazardous has been approved explicitly
 
04:52:45.750 --> 04:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
or implicitly by the federal government
 
04:52:47.830 --> 04:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
04:52:49.590 --> 04:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
sh shall issue a notice to the
 
04:52:51.910 --> 04:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate Federal agency that the
 
04:52:54.670 --> 04:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
polluting activity cannot lawfully be
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
carried out within or over the state of
 
04:52:59.070 --> 04:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire pursuant to the 10th
 
04:53:02.030 --> 04:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment which um uh the prior speaker
 
04:53:05.110 --> 04:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
just U so eloquently discussed I think
 
04:53:09.628 --> 04:53:09.638 align:start position:0%
this is huge um the purpose of the state
 
04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
government is to create a check and a
 
04:53:13.310 --> 04:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
buffer against overreaches of the
 
04:53:16.670 --> 04:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
federal government and uh that this
 
04:53:19.190 --> 04:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be um implemented as soon as
 
04:53:23.470 --> 04:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
possible um similarly in lines 15 to 20
 
04:53:25.470 --> 04:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
um similar language talks about foreign
 
04:53:27.948 --> 04:53:27.958 align:start position:0%
entities that may or may not be
 
04:53:30.670 --> 04:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
participating in uh solar radiation
 
04:53:33.310 --> 04:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
management or other um geoengineering
 
04:53:36.548 --> 04:53:36.558 align:start position:0%
activ activities um this is our only
 
04:53:38.708 --> 04:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
line of defense at this point and it's
 
04:53:41.310 --> 04:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
only a bill in proposal at the moment
 
04:53:44.590 --> 04:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
but there is no discussion in this um
 
04:53:46.510 --> 04:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
congressionally mandated research plan
 
04:53:48.070 --> 04:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
written by the Biden Harris
 
04:53:50.750 --> 04:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
Administration about any consent of the
 
04:53:53.230 --> 04:53:53.240 align:start position:0%
Govern um any
 
04:53:56.670 --> 04:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
um direct influence and uh due process
 
04:54:01.150 --> 04:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
of law um surrounding this um uh agenda
 
04:54:04.628 --> 04:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
um I could cite page 10 10 of the
 
04:54:06.830 --> 04:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
research report that I understand um is
 
04:54:09.430 --> 04:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
in your possession um and I think page
 
04:54:13.110 --> 04:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
10 sums up the issue um very well um on
 
04:54:15.070 --> 04:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph of the introduction
 
04:54:17.948 --> 04:54:17.958 align:start position:0%
it says deployment of solar radiation
 
04:54:20.430 --> 04:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
modification would inevitably involve
 
04:54:22.990 --> 04:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
its own risks almost all of which are
 
04:54:25.390 --> 04:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
poorly understood and some of which are
 
04:54:28.230 --> 04:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
unknown this means that this is an
 
04:54:30.670 --> 04:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
experiment um and it's an experiment
 
04:54:32.948 --> 04:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
with significant hazards to human health
 
04:54:36.190 --> 04:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
and to the environment um another point
 
04:54:38.910 --> 04:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
I would like to um point out to the
 
04:54:43.230 --> 04:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
committee is on page uh 32 yes of the uh
 
04:54:45.390 --> 04:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
congressionally mandated research report
 
04:54:48.070 --> 04:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
um discussing impacts on food and water
 
04:54:51.868 --> 04:54:51.878 align:start position:0%
systems um it points out that um extreme
 
04:54:53.788 --> 04:54:53.798 align:start position:0%
weather events including prolonged dry
 
04:54:55.708 --> 04:54:55.718 align:start position:0%
spells and excessive rain reduce crop
 
04:54:58.430 --> 04:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
yields excessive heat destroys crops and
 
04:55:00.628 --> 04:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
kills livestock warming and drought are
 
04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
projected to result in substantially
 
04:55:04.150 --> 04:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
increased likelihood of multibreed
 
04:55:06.548 --> 04:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
basket crop failures as soon as
 
04:55:11.190 --> 04:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
2030 um uh if if that's my time um
 
04:55:13.030 --> 04:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's my reason for supporting this
 
04:55:17.548 --> 04:55:17.558 align:start position:0%
Bill yes you can sum up um that that's
 
04:55:20.990 --> 04:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay great good thankly thank you for
 
04:55:23.110 --> 04:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
Josie for your testimony because you're
 
04:55:24.750 --> 04:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
the first person today who's actually
 
04:55:26.590 --> 04:55:26.600 align:start position:0%
addressed the substance of the bill
 
04:55:29.470 --> 04:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
you're welcome and we appreciate that
 
04:55:34.190 --> 04:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's my pleasure okay next up is Melissa

makus and I apologize if I mispronounced
 
04:55:42.510 --> 04:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
that's fine that's fine it's
 
04:55:44.548 --> 04:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
understandable hi my name is Melissa
 
04:55:47.270 --> 04:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
kakis and I'm from Newton New Hampshire
 
04:55:51.628 --> 04:55:51.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm in support of HB
 
04:55:51.638 --> 04:55:53.350 align:start position:0%
and I'm in support of HB
1700

04:55:53.350 --> 04:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
1700
 
04:55:57.230 --> 04:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
um due to the detriment of um the our
 
04:55:59.830 --> 04:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
environment um our children our
 
04:56:05.788 --> 04:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
grandchildren us um back in 2002 there
 
04:56:09.590 --> 04:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
was a air for um a person who was in the
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
Air Force her name was Kristen
 
04:56:13.990 --> 04:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
Megan and she was an environmental
 
04:56:16.350 --> 04:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
specialist and what she would her job
 
04:56:19.110 --> 04:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
was to do was to have everything go
 
04:56:21.030 --> 04:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
through her that was going to be used in
 
04:56:21.040 --> 04:56:21.708 align:start position:0%
through her that was going to be used in
the

04:56:21.708 --> 04:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:56:24.390 --> 04:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
military and um someone had come up to
 
04:56:26.350 --> 04:56:26.360 align:start position:0%
her and said hey you know there have you
 
04:56:27.868 --> 04:56:27.878 align:start position:0%
ever heard of chemtrails and she was
 
04:56:30.548 --> 04:56:30.558 align:start position:0%
like No And she set out to debunk it and
 
04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
she found that it was it was really
 
04:56:32.280 --> 04:56:33.868 align:start position:0%
she found that it was it was really
happening

04:56:33.868 --> 04:56:33.878 align:start position:0%
happening
 
04:56:38.548 --> 04:56:38.558 align:start position:0%
and so she didn't sign off on the c52 is
 
04:56:38.558 --> 04:56:39.750 align:start position:0%
and so she didn't sign off on the c52 is
and

04:56:39.750 --> 04:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:41.910 --> 04:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
they pretty much sent her to another
 
04:56:44.310 --> 04:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
base they kind of threatened her and now
 
04:56:45.390 --> 04:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
she's a
 
04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
whistleblower um because what she found
 
04:56:51.948 --> 04:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
was they were spraying the skies with u
 
04:56:55.310 --> 04:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
barium aluminum andrum
 
04:56:58.030 --> 04:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
stonum but anyway you can look her up
 
04:57:01.390 --> 04:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
and also if you look up Dane Wellington
 
04:57:03.948 --> 04:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
it's geoengineering. org
 
04:57:06.350 --> 04:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
um he also has an immense amount of
 
04:57:08.070 --> 04:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
information he's been doing this for
 
04:57:11.230 --> 04:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
years um am I allowed to ask you a
 
04:57:14.910 --> 04:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
question or no them instruction no we
 
04:57:18.230 --> 04:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
ask you questions it's okay okay I was
 
04:57:20.110 --> 04:57:20.120 align:start position:0%
just wondering I didn't
 
04:57:22.350 --> 04:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
know um anyway I brought some pictures
 
04:57:25.110 --> 04:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
in and um I'd like it if you could take
 
04:57:27.750 --> 04:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
a look at them I took them you know over
 
04:57:31.548 --> 04:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
my house in Newton and
 
04:57:34.270 --> 04:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
um I also like put information in there
 
04:57:37.270 --> 04:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
how to get a hold of how to look at
 
04:57:40.510 --> 04:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
danne Wellington and um Kristen Megan
 
04:57:41.910 --> 04:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
and where to go to look that up and you
 
04:57:46.430 --> 04:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
can watch the dimming on that site as
 
04:57:49.070 --> 04:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
well that's really all I have to say and
 
04:57:51.948 --> 04:57:51.958 align:start position:0%
all I did want to say one more thing so
 
04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
far I've seen all the people here and
 
04:57:55.990 --> 04:57:56.000 align:start position:0%

thank
 
04:58:19.390 --> 04:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
you okay next up will
 
04:58:19.400 --> 04:58:22.628 align:start position:0%
you okay next up will
be

04:58:22.628 --> 04:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:30.948 --> 04:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:34.670 --> 04:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
Terry hello
 
04:58:37.750 --> 04:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:40.788 --> 04:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
nothing but I came here
 
04:58:44.948 --> 04:58:44.958 align:start position:0%
to speak about what was said last
 
04:58:50.110 --> 04:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
week uh in reference to the government
 
04:58:54.708 --> 04:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
and the intentional um
 
04:58:54.718 --> 04:58:56.310 align:start position:0%
and the intentional um
geoengineering

04:58:56.310 --> 04:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
geoengineering
 
04:58:59.628 --> 04:58:59.638 align:start position:0%
so jp5 and
 
04:59:02.470 --> 04:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
jp8 are geoengineering with or without
 
04:59:05.190 --> 04:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
consent and they're going to keep doing
 
04:59:05.200 --> 04:59:07.628 align:start position:0%
consent and they're going to keep doing
it

04:59:07.628 --> 04:59:07.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:59:13.190 --> 04:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:15.708 --> 04:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
on I think this bill is
 
04:59:18.190 --> 04:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
important but it needs to be
 
04:59:22.270 --> 04:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
revised there is a a a vast private
 
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
sector for
 
04:59:27.390 --> 04:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
instance of
 
04:59:31.070 --> 04:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
course uh well for instance the teleride
 
04:59:34.708 --> 04:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
ski area has done on this in 2012 it's
 
04:59:38.150 --> 04:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
been happening since 2007 I don't know
 
04:59:42.510 --> 04:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
of any actual cloud seeding projects
 
04:59:45.190 --> 04:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
past the Mississippi River
 
04:59:45.200 --> 04:59:46.868 align:start position:0%
past the Mississippi River
since

04:59:46.868 --> 04:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
since
 
04:59:46.878 --> 04:59:48.470 align:start position:0%
since
49

04:59:48.470 --> 04:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
49
 
04:59:50.750 --> 04:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
but as far
 
04:59:56.948 --> 04:59:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:01.548 --> 05:00:01.558 align:start position:0%
like people for hire and and the private
 
05:00:04.310 --> 05:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
like a private company
 
05:00:06.990 --> 05:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
they have full reain they can do
 
05:00:10.270 --> 05:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
this how I've I've heard of people
 
05:00:12.910 --> 05:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
wanting nice weather on their on their
 
05:00:16.230 --> 05:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
um wedding and they have full legal
 
05:00:19.590 --> 05:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
right to do so so I think the bill
 
05:00:22.150 --> 05:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
should be revised away from trying to
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
stop government from doing something
 
05:00:26.548 --> 05:00:26.558 align:start position:0%
because that's a a lot harder but what's
 
05:00:30.590 --> 05:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
important I think um is is the private
 
05:00:33.990 --> 05:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
sector I also wanted to plug Jim Lee
 
05:00:38.350 --> 05:00:38.360 align:start position:0%
with climate view.org he's a a a
 
05:00:38.360 --> 05:00:39.868 align:start position:0%
with climate view.org he's a a a
tremendously

05:00:39.868 --> 05:00:39.878 align:start position:0%
tremendously
 
05:00:44.070 --> 05:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
useful resource um as far as learning
 
05:00:47.390 --> 05:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
about the reality and sifting through
 
05:00:51.190 --> 05:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
the fake and the fear and the things
 
05:00:53.510 --> 05:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
that don't matter and things that can't
 
05:00:53.520 --> 05:00:54.470 align:start position:0%
that don't matter and things that can't
be

05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:00:56.948 --> 05:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
changed so with
 
05:01:01.350 --> 05:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
that I leave you I had nothing this I I
 
05:01:03.750 --> 05:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
came here just randomly I heard about it
 
05:01:08.788 --> 05:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
yesterday so here I am uh trying to be a
 
05:01:10.910 --> 05:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
part of History I guess and uh hopefully
 
05:01:14.510 --> 05:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
it goes through and and we all learn
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
something and
 
05:01:20.230 --> 05:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah a bit a good day thank you we
 
05:01:22.390 --> 05:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate you adding your voice to the
 
05:01:25.750 --> 05:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
chorus thank you very much next up is
 
05:01:30.548 --> 05:01:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:36.990 --> 05:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:41.350 --> 05:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
Newport hi um I'm Risa Evans from
 
05:01:46.150 --> 05:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
kukuk um and I want to thank you all for
 
05:01:48.310 --> 05:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
Contin continuing the hearing to today
 
05:01:49.948 --> 05:01:49.958 align:start position:0%
so that more people had a chance to
 
05:01:53.110 --> 05:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
speak and also to the sponsors of this
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
bill for raising this really important
 
05:01:59.390 --> 05:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
topic um I support the premises that
 
05:02:01.750 --> 05:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
underly HB
 
05:02:01.760 --> 05:02:03.470 align:start position:0%
underly HB
1700

05:02:03.470 --> 05:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
1700
 
05:02:06.670 --> 05:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
I think that um
 
05:02:08.670 --> 05:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
geoengineering um experimental
 
05:02:11.190 --> 05:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
geoengineering poses a real and present
 
05:02:12.628 --> 05:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
threat to New Hampshire and whether you
 
05:02:14.110 --> 05:02:14.120 align:start position:0%
think it's already happening or it's
 
05:02:16.390 --> 05:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
sort of in the air and on the horizon
 
05:02:17.868 --> 05:02:17.878 align:start position:0%
it's really something that we need to be
 
05:02:21.150 --> 05:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
thinking about um and we don't have any
 
05:02:23.628 --> 05:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
laws in place that protect us or that
 
05:02:25.948 --> 05:02:25.958 align:start position:0%
provide any kind of bulwark for what may
 
05:02:27.788 --> 05:02:27.798 align:start position:0%
be coming down the pike and I know
 
05:02:29.270 --> 05:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of reference to this
 
05:02:31.150 --> 05:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
report which sort of outlines the
 
05:02:33.590 --> 05:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
governance plan that really has no place
 
05:02:36.390 --> 05:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
for the states um I wanted to speak
 
05:02:39.030 --> 05:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
specifically about our existing law um
 
05:02:40.510 --> 05:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
about weather modification
 
05:02:42.628 --> 05:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
experimentation and urge that at a
 
05:02:46.470 --> 05:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
minimum you repeal this law which really
 
05:02:49.830 --> 05:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
invites disaster um this is a law that
 
05:02:52.350 --> 05:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
allows anybody to come in and partner
 
05:02:54.788 --> 05:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
with a state agency and with the
 
05:02:56.350 --> 05:02:56.360 align:start position:0%
approval of the executive Council and
 
05:02:58.830 --> 05:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
the governor to conduct weather
 
05:03:01.270 --> 05:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
modification experiments do they have to
 
05:03:03.830 --> 05:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
show that the experiments are safe or
 
05:03:05.708 --> 05:03:05.718 align:start position:0%
that the benefits outweigh the risks no
 
05:03:07.868 --> 05:03:07.878 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement of that are there
 
05:03:10.430 --> 05:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
any standards any safety standards that
 
05:03:12.670 --> 05:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
govern the approval process is there
 
05:03:15.110 --> 05:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
even any approval process at all for for
 
05:03:16.910 --> 05:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
this bill for I mean for this law for
 
05:03:19.230 --> 05:03:19.240 align:start position:0%
weather modification there's no approval
 
05:03:22.350 --> 05:03:22.360 align:start position:0%
process there's no method for Meaningful
 
05:03:24.430 --> 05:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
public input there's no method for
 
05:03:27.230 --> 05:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
Meaningful public consent and this bill
 
05:03:29.070 --> 05:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
really says nothing about what happens
 
05:03:30.990 --> 05:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
if there are activities of this sort
 
05:03:32.708 --> 05:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
conducted in the state and people are
 
05:03:35.110 --> 05:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
injured property is injured there's no
 
05:03:37.868 --> 05:03:37.878 align:start position:0%
recourse offered here and so I think
 
05:03:39.910 --> 05:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
that this statute is really really sort
 
05:03:42.628 --> 05:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
of a danger to have on the books and at
 
05:03:45.230 --> 05:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
a minimum we should get rid of it put
 
05:03:48.788 --> 05:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
all this stuff on hold um prohibit it um
 
05:03:50.830 --> 05:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
until we can study it further so I I
 
05:03:54.310 --> 05:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
would just urge that you know if if this
 
05:03:58.390 --> 05:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
bill um seems to you unworkable in any
 
05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
way you know I'm sure the Reps who
 
05:04:01.750 --> 05:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
sponsored it will work with you to make
 
05:04:04.030 --> 05:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
it sort of something that that seems
 
05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
more manageable but at a minimum you
 
05:04:10.270 --> 05:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
know let's let's get um RSA 12 F1 off
 
05:04:12.548 --> 05:04:12.558 align:start position:0%
the books and replace it with something
 
05:04:14.548 --> 05:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
that if it's going to allow any
 
05:04:16.750 --> 05:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
activities of this sort that really
 
05:04:20.110 --> 05:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
enables the people of New Hampshire to
 
05:04:23.750 --> 05:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
meaningfully um regulate such activities
 
05:04:26.230 --> 05:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
and to participate in the process of
 
05:04:28.670 --> 05:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
governing those activities and only to
 
05:04:31.230 --> 05:04:31.240 align:start position:0%
have them occur with our informed
 
05:04:33.070 --> 05:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
consent thank you
 
05:04:35.830 --> 05:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you appreciate you being being
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
here today next up is Michelle Whitmer
 
05:04:54.110 --> 05:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:56.230 --> 05:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
stratum so good afternoon
 
05:04:58.510 --> 05:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
Representatives I appreciate you taking
 
05:05:03.110 --> 05:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
the time to let us voice our opinions um
 
05:05:06.110 --> 05:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
I support hb17
 
05:05:08.788 --> 05:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
FN and as you already know I'm Michelle
 
05:05:11.788 --> 05:05:11.798 align:start position:0%
Whitmer from Newport um Josie said it
 
05:05:13.910 --> 05:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
best as to why this bill needs to be
 
05:05:17.110 --> 05:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
passed I would like to offer to you so I
 
05:05:19.628 --> 05:05:19.638 align:start position:0%
am in support of the bill and for every
 
05:05:22.708 --> 05:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
reason the Josie has mentioned so
 
05:05:24.910 --> 05:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
eloquently so I learned of this hearing
 
05:05:29.390 --> 05:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
last night but I wanted to make sure um
 
05:05:32.590 --> 05:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
you had some knowledge we have a small
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
Farm we're a nano Farm we have multiple
 
05:05:39.628 --> 05:05:39.638 align:start position:0%
apple pear peach cherry trees we have um
 
05:05:42.150 --> 05:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
an a half an acre that we dedicate to
 
05:05:45.070 --> 05:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
our community in Newport for veterans
 
05:05:46.590 --> 05:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
the elderly and those who can't afford
 
05:05:50.590 --> 05:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
to have um fresh vegetables and fruit
 
05:05:52.788 --> 05:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
we've had Farm camps with children that
 
05:05:56.390 --> 05:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
we try to teach how to grow and
 
05:05:59.548 --> 05:05:59.558 align:start position:0%
understand nature and how to live off it
 
05:06:01.628 --> 05:06:01.638 align:start position:0%
um we have seen some major impacts with
 
05:06:05.750 --> 05:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
what we um are experiencing with the jro
 
05:06:05.760 --> 05:06:07.150 align:start position:0%
what we um are experiencing with the jro
engineering

05:06:07.150 --> 05:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
engineering
 
05:06:11.350 --> 05:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
Chemtrails um also we do have cows goats
 
05:06:14.350 --> 05:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
a horse chickens and turkeys so it's not
 
05:06:17.990 --> 05:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
just um and and 8 be hives so it's not
 
05:06:20.548 --> 05:06:20.558 align:start position:0%
that we just simply have Orchards and
 
05:06:22.788 --> 05:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
Gardens we have it all okay we want to
 
05:06:27.030 --> 05:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
be a self-sufficient Nano farm and so we
 
05:06:29.350 --> 05:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
know that aluminum particulates are
 
05:06:32.110 --> 05:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
being sprayed in the Chemtrails we know
 
05:06:34.788 --> 05:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
that it is higher than levels which are
 
05:06:36.910 --> 05:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
safe for humans but it also is having an
 
05:06:39.788 --> 05:06:39.798 align:start position:0%
impact on our trees and on our animals
 
05:06:43.270 --> 05:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
and our water supply um nanop particles
 
05:06:45.548 --> 05:06:45.558 align:start position:0%
so what happens with aluminum changes
 
05:06:48.590 --> 05:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
the soil composition some plants such as
 
05:06:51.670 --> 05:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
blackberries tomato plants um certain
 
05:06:55.070 --> 05:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
trees such as the balsams and Evergreens
 
05:06:59.310 --> 05:06:59.320 align:start position:0%
require um an not the alkaline state it
 
05:07:01.788 --> 05:07:01.798 align:start position:0%
would be the acidic the acidic what is
 
05:07:03.390 --> 05:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
happening with the aluminums as it's
 
05:07:06.150 --> 05:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
breaking down into our soil and also in
 
05:07:07.948 --> 05:07:07.958 align:start position:0%
our water by the way but with our soil
 
05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
it is turning our acidic state to an
 
05:07:15.310 --> 05:07:15.320 align:start position:0%
um a ph and alkaline so we are losing
 
05:07:17.750 --> 05:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
some of our trees and you can see some
 
05:07:19.390 --> 05:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
of this in California with the Conifer
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
trees which are just similar to our
 
05:07:23.270 --> 05:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
Balsam if you look up and you start
 
05:07:25.230 --> 05:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
seeing these these trees that require
 
05:07:27.230 --> 05:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
the acidity they're giving their one
 
05:07:29.708 --> 05:07:29.718 align:start position:0%
last push in their in their
 
05:07:32.390 --> 05:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
tree the Chute is dead the branches are
 
05:07:34.830 --> 05:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
dead the very tip you will see still
 
05:07:37.070 --> 05:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
alive and that's the last tip to for
 
05:07:39.548 --> 05:07:39.558 align:start position:0%
propagation within our our trees they're
 
05:07:41.310 --> 05:07:41.320 align:start position:0%
telling you something and if you don't
 
05:07:43.350 --> 05:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
know it I'm telling you now it is
 
05:07:45.910 --> 05:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
happening we are losing some of our
 
05:07:48.470 --> 05:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
vegetation we are losing our soils that
 
05:07:51.230 --> 05:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
allow us to grow product for our
 
05:07:53.948 --> 05:07:53.958 align:start position:0%
consumers and for yourselves you have
 
05:07:56.830 --> 05:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
masks on Nano particulates in the air
 
05:07:59.788 --> 05:07:59.798 align:start position:0%
can go through those masks and the blood
 
05:08:02.708 --> 05:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
barrier it goes through as you inhale
 
05:08:04.510 --> 05:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
the smaller the Nano particle the more
 
05:08:07.830 --> 05:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
dangerous it is we have Plastics we have
 
05:08:10.788 --> 05:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
Al we have the aluminums and we have
 
05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
borium you are breathing it in and it is
 
05:08:16.230 --> 05:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
going through your lungs into your heart
 
05:08:18.230 --> 05:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
crossing your blood barrier even into
 
05:08:21.750 --> 05:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
your brain I in my my field is not
 
05:08:24.110 --> 05:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
farming that we do for fun we have an
 
05:08:26.310 --> 05:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
intimate relationship with our farm and
 
05:08:29.470 --> 05:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
it's fun I am more on the health field
 
05:08:32.510 --> 05:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
and the increase of dementia uh
 
05:08:34.788 --> 05:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
Parkinson's all these neurological
 
05:08:36.948 --> 05:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
disorders are increasing because we are
 
05:08:39.948 --> 05:08:39.958 align:start position:0%
taking that aluminum into our brain we
 
05:08:42.548 --> 05:08:42.558 align:start position:0%
are not given consent for this to to be
 
05:08:45.430 --> 05:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
pushed into our lungs with every breath
 
05:08:49.150 --> 05:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
we take that is not our consent and I
 
05:08:52.788 --> 05:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
was 11 years old when the 1985 bill was
 
05:08:54.548 --> 05:08:54.558 align:start position:0%
passed and I certainly wasn't given
 
05:08:57.510 --> 05:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
consent then either and I do expect as
 
05:08:59.110 --> 05:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
our Representatives that if you don't
 
05:09:02.270 --> 05:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
believe in this bill then fine you have
 
05:09:03.788 --> 05:09:03.798 align:start position:0%
no Pro you should have no problem
 
05:09:06.110 --> 05:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
passing it because if it's not real to
 
05:09:08.910 --> 05:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
you then what harm would it do it needs
 
05:09:12.110 --> 05:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
to be passed I have more
 
05:09:14.590 --> 05:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
neurodivergent um family members and I
 
05:09:16.628 --> 05:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
do believe it has to do with the
 
05:09:20.430 --> 05:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
Chemtrails we can see the Chemtrails
 
05:09:23.670 --> 05:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
have different masses you can tell when
 
05:09:25.350 --> 05:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
the Chemtrails are being
 
05:09:27.628 --> 05:09:27.638 align:start position:0%
sprayed what's going to happen next my
 
05:09:29.030 --> 05:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
husband knows it well enough where he'll
 
05:09:30.510 --> 05:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
be like baby get your chores done
 
05:09:32.070 --> 05:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
because in an hour if you look at these
 
05:09:33.788 --> 05:09:33.798 align:start position:0%
Trails coming over on the east we're
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
going to start having Wind And by
 
05:09:37.868 --> 05:09:37.878 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we're going to have rain we
 
05:09:40.910 --> 05:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
have seen Vibrant Plants on our farm
 
05:09:45.110 --> 05:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
spraying done on a Sunday and by Monday
 
05:09:48.430 --> 05:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
had mildew and mold on them to where you
 
05:09:51.390 --> 05:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't even the plants were fried they
 
05:09:51.400 --> 05:09:52.230 align:start position:0%
couldn't even the plants were fried they
were

05:09:52.230 --> 05:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:09:55.430 --> 05:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
useless we are going our farm is going
 
05:09:57.548 --> 05:09:57.558 align:start position:0%
to the part to a point now where we are
 
05:09:59.270 --> 05:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
planting indoors
 
05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
only our birds are indoors only
 
05:10:05.910 --> 05:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
and we're when is this going to stop it
 
05:10:07.470 --> 05:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
needs to start here and my
 
05:10:09.390 --> 05:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation to you to add to the bill
 
05:10:10.350 --> 05:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
if I
 
05:10:14.070 --> 05:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
may my husband and I have you're quite a
 
05:10:17.430 --> 05:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
bit over your time Sor I will wrap it up
 
05:10:19.708 --> 05:10:19.718 align:start position:0%
thank you great the bill should also
 
05:10:19.718 --> 05:10:20.788 align:start position:0%
thank you great the bill should also
include

05:10:20.788 --> 05:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
include
 
05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
transponders it has to have a point
 
05:10:24.868 --> 05:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
where we can add transponders to the
 
05:10:27.470 --> 05:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
sprays mechanism on these planes if you
 
05:10:29.150 --> 05:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
come into New Hampshire put a
 
05:10:31.590 --> 05:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
transponder on your sprayer and then we
 
05:10:33.830 --> 05:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
will have transponders on the ground and
 
05:10:36.190 --> 05:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
we will automatically shut off those
 
05:10:38.230 --> 05:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
sprayers when you enter New Hampshire
 
05:10:41.230 --> 05:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
ground or air that is what needs to
 
05:10:44.590 --> 05:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
happen forget the $500,000 fine and a
 
05:10:46.830 --> 05:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
felony because people who are doing this
 
05:10:49.310 --> 05:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
have the money to pay it we need to put
 
05:10:50.830 --> 05:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
transponders on the ground and in the
 
05:10:53.750 --> 05:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
air and we do have some ideas if you're
 
05:10:55.590 --> 05:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
if you don't know how to do
 
05:10:57.750 --> 05:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
this reach out to me because we'll
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
figure it
 
05:11:02.628 --> 05:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
out and I'm done okay great thank you
 
05:11:06.830 --> 05:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
very much all right next up is Tina flag
 
05:11:06.840 --> 05:11:21.750 align:start position:0%
very much all right next up is Tina flag
of

05:11:21.750 --> 05:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:24.590 --> 05:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
stratum hi thank you my name is Tina
 
05:11:28.110 --> 05:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
flag stratum New Hampshire and I don't
 
05:11:31.070 --> 05:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
have anything prepared because I
 
05:11:33.590 --> 05:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
basically just found out about this also
 
05:11:35.390 --> 05:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
within the week
 
05:11:38.910 --> 05:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
it's um pretty much flying under the
 
05:11:42.868 --> 05:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
radar no pun intended um I've heard a
 
05:11:44.310 --> 05:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
the since I've been here people
 
05:11:48.030 --> 05:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
testifying facts very you know poignant
 
05:11:50.830 --> 05:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
facts and things about the Constitution
 
05:11:54.750 --> 05:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
and our rights and pollution and it's
 
05:11:55.910 --> 05:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's all
 
05:11:59.350 --> 05:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
true I don't I really don't understand I
 
05:12:02.310 --> 05:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
just want to offer some common sense and
 
05:12:05.910 --> 05:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
um acknowledgment of what I see I don't
 
05:12:08.430 --> 05:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
know why we're the ones having to tell
 
05:12:10.390 --> 05:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
you guys about what's going on in the
 
05:12:11.910 --> 05:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
sky when you can walk out the building
 
05:12:14.350 --> 05:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
right now and look up and see it the
 
05:12:16.868 --> 05:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
whole way here from the Sea Coast I was
 
05:12:19.470 --> 05:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
watching whatever they are planes drones
 
05:12:19.480 --> 05:12:20.470 align:start position:0%
watching whatever they are planes drones
whatever

05:12:20.470 --> 05:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
05:12:22.750 --> 05:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
spraying I know we're not allowed to ask
 
05:12:24.590 --> 05:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
questions but if I could I would say
 
05:12:27.510 --> 05:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
what are they spraying like that's it's
 
05:12:30.270 --> 05:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
pretty Common Sense I've heard online
 
05:12:31.990 --> 05:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of you just have to to
 
05:12:34.470 --> 05:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
look they're calling them stratospheric
 
05:12:36.788 --> 05:12:36.798 align:start position:0%
U instead of chemtrails because you know
 
05:12:38.350 --> 05:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
you can't say that it's a conspiracy
 
05:12:41.310 --> 05:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
theory um and it's not contrails because
 
05:12:43.310 --> 05:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
I think in in fifth grade we all learned
 
05:12:45.190 --> 05:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
that condensation
 
05:12:47.910 --> 05:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
evaporates these are lines that go on
 
05:12:50.788 --> 05:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
for half a mile and then become walls of
 
05:12:53.628 --> 05:12:53.638 align:start position:0%
clouds we're being Whited out every day
 
05:12:55.788 --> 05:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
there the weather modification and it's
 
05:12:58.230 --> 05:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
well documented Harvard started this
 
05:13:01.350 --> 05:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
Harvard has the studies the um there's
 
05:13:01.360 --> 05:13:02.670 align:start position:0%
Harvard has the studies the um there's
Tes

05:13:02.670 --> 05:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
Tes
 
05:13:05.190 --> 05:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
from not Eisenhower I'm going to get
 
05:13:09.230 --> 05:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
that wrong but anyway um VP from Kennedy
 
05:13:12.310 --> 05:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
in the 60s uh he did a an commencement
 
05:13:14.750 --> 05:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
speech and he was talking about weather
 
05:13:17.070 --> 05:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
modification and he who controls the
 
05:13:19.590 --> 05:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
weather will control the world I mean
 
05:13:24.390 --> 05:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
they've who yeah Johnson thank you uh
 
05:13:26.110 --> 05:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
Kennedy was shot on the day I was born I
 
05:13:30.390 --> 05:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
should know that but anyway um so it
 
05:13:32.470 --> 05:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's happening it's up there all you
 
05:13:35.948 --> 05:13:35.958 align:start position:0%
have to do is look up just look up and
 
05:13:38.590 --> 05:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
look up again and compare the sky from
 
05:13:40.788 --> 05:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
now for the first time you look up to an
 
05:13:42.830 --> 05:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
hour later to two hours later walk out
 
05:13:44.868 --> 05:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
at dusk at night when there's a full
 
05:13:47.948 --> 05:13:47.958 align:start position:0%
moon you can see massive amounts of
 
05:13:50.070 --> 05:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
spraying what's in them they're being
 
05:13:51.750 --> 05:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
tested they've been tested there's
 
05:13:54.390 --> 05:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
definitely aluminum particulates and
 
05:13:56.628 --> 05:13:56.638 align:start position:0%
I've heard Bill Gates you just type in
 
05:14:00.230 --> 05:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
on a internet search Bill Gates dimming
 
05:14:03.430 --> 05:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
the Sun the dimming is the documentary
 
05:14:05.948 --> 05:14:05.958 align:start position:0%
everyone should see but regardless I
 
05:14:08.830 --> 05:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
think we're all experiencing it and able
 
05:14:12.030 --> 05:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
to see it for ourselves Bill Gates is on
 
05:14:14.990 --> 05:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
video all over saying that oh I'm
 
05:14:16.868 --> 05:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
thinking about investing in this program
 
05:14:18.830 --> 05:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
and this is connected with Harvard
 
05:14:21.590 --> 05:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
studies and P published and well
 
05:14:24.030 --> 05:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
documented and he said that their goal
 
05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
is climate change which we all know is a
 
05:14:27.948 --> 05:14:27.958 align:start position:0%
political agenda I'm not saying we don't
 
05:14:30.350 --> 05:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
pollute the the planet obviously we do
 
05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
and have been but but global warming
 
05:14:37.190 --> 05:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
climate chain change is a political
 
05:14:40.868 --> 05:14:40.878 align:start position:0%
agenda and he was which he backs and he
 
05:14:43.190 --> 05:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
says that there's the whole thing about
 
05:14:45.670 --> 05:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
the sun is there because of the climate
 
05:14:47.948 --> 05:14:47.958 align:start position:0%
change connection is that they want to
 
05:14:51.110 --> 05:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
spray the things the particulates to
 
05:14:55.430 --> 05:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
reflect the sun back to the to space in
 
05:14:57.548 --> 05:14:57.558 align:start position:0%
order to block it from us be under the
 
05:15:00.708 --> 05:15:00.718 align:start position:0%
guise of global warming climate change
 
05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
which is crazy because we all know what
 
05:15:06.070 --> 05:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
the sun gives us vitamin D almost the
 
05:15:07.868 --> 05:15:07.878 align:start position:0%
only source of vitamin D we can really
 
05:15:10.868 --> 05:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
get without supplementing and it is
 
05:15:13.110 --> 05:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
required for every function of our
 
05:15:15.830 --> 05:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
planet the food we eat and it's what's
 
05:15:17.230 --> 05:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
happening is everything's being
 
05:15:19.350 --> 05:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
contaminated not just mine and all the
 
05:15:21.390 --> 05:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
people sitting here but all your
 
05:15:23.110 --> 05:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
properties our
 
05:15:25.830 --> 05:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
wells sep I mean the well the ground
 
05:15:27.830 --> 05:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
water everything is being affected by
 
05:15:30.350 --> 05:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
this we're all being affected everything
 
05:15:33.548 --> 05:15:33.558 align:start position:0%
you drink and eat and when you walk
 
05:15:35.310 --> 05:15:35.320 align:start position:0%
outside the air were being attacked on
 
05:15:38.230 --> 05:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
all levels and I don't know what we were
 
05:15:40.030 --> 05:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to address as far as what's in
 
05:15:42.788 --> 05:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
that bill but again it's I think you
 
05:15:45.830 --> 05:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
know it will probably not pass and it's
 
05:15:47.830 --> 05:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
fine because it's the beginning and I
 
05:15:50.430 --> 05:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
want to tell you online on the just what
 
05:15:53.670 --> 05:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
I looked at myself in the last few days
 
05:15:56.190 --> 05:15:56.200 align:start position:0%
people um from States all over the
 
05:16:00.110 --> 05:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
country are talking about this bill even
 
05:16:02.830 --> 05:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
though two local citizens started it
 
05:16:05.070 --> 05:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
everyone's talking about it and saying
 
05:16:07.270 --> 05:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
go New Hampshire live for your die yeah
 
05:16:08.628 --> 05:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
it'll probably fail a lot of people
 
05:16:10.750 --> 05:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
don't have any faith that it's going to
 
05:16:12.830 --> 05:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
which is fine but people from all states
 
05:16:14.670 --> 05:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
all over the country and countries all
 
05:16:16.910 --> 05:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
over the world are talking about this
 
05:16:19.070 --> 05:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
bill because what's happening in the sky
 
05:16:21.510 --> 05:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
outside of this building is happening
 
05:16:24.030 --> 05:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
all over this
 
05:16:27.070 --> 05:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
planet thank
 
05:16:30.830 --> 05:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you very much the last
 
05:16:32.830 --> 05:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
pink card I have was submitted by
 
05:16:39.310 --> 05:16:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:42.030 --> 05:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
left I think she wanted to just take two
 
05:16:44.430 --> 05:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
minutes to explain some material that
 
05:16:46.230 --> 05:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
she handed out to members of the
 
05:16:48.590 --> 05:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
committee while we're waiting for her I
 
05:16:51.708 --> 05:16:51.718 align:start position:0%
know representative PL oh there she is
 
05:16:54.470 --> 05:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
all right hang on Tom we'll get back to
 
05:16:57.150 --> 05:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
you representative uh Penza you have a
 
05:16:59.310 --> 05:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
couple of minutes to explain what you
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
handed out
 
05:17:00.400 --> 05:17:12.590 align:start position:0%
handed out
earlier

05:17:12.590 --> 05:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:14.230 --> 05:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
so first off I'd just like to tell you
 
05:17:15.470 --> 05:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
that I had

sent the committee um uh about 30 hours
 
05:17:24.190 --> 05:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
worth of work and it came from the first
 
05:17:26.830 --> 05:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
meeting and there were a lot of
 
05:17:29.270 --> 05:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
questions I know uh chairman you
 
05:17:30.548 --> 05:17:30.558 align:start position:0%
basically said that you know how does
 
05:17:32.070 --> 05:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
the speak to the bill to speak to the
 
05:17:35.548 --> 05:17:35.558 align:start position:0%
bill well my testimony um was in
 
05:17:37.230 --> 05:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
response to all of the questions that
 
05:17:39.390 --> 05:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
you guys had you know is this really
 
05:17:41.390 --> 05:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
happening this type you know there was a
 
05:17:45.150 --> 05:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
lot of that and so um I just want you to
 
05:17:46.910 --> 05:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
please look at the email it's got about
 
05:17:50.230 --> 05:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
12 attachments it has a 12-page document
 
05:17:53.868 --> 05:17:53.878 align:start position:0%
in there um and it's it's really
 
05:17:56.030 --> 05:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
important and of course so many people
 
05:17:58.868 --> 05:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
had testimony that was relating to this
 
05:18:00.750 --> 05:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
which is the White House document I have
 
05:18:04.150 --> 05:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
other ones if if you need be um I am
 
05:18:07.628 --> 05:18:07.638 align:start position:0%
going to amend this bill and and and do
 
05:18:12.310 --> 05:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
a a straight repeal of 12f there are
 
05:18:15.430 --> 05:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
multiple issues with the current bill I
 
05:18:16.830 --> 05:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
understand I understand where you've
 
05:18:19.030 --> 05:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
come I've heard it from everyone I've
 
05:18:20.788 --> 05:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
gotten multiple calls from members of
 
05:18:22.750 --> 05:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
the committee um in regards with
 
05:18:24.270 --> 05:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement and other things that are
 
05:18:27.548 --> 05:18:27.558 align:start position:0%
very difficult I think that um I think
 
05:18:31.070 --> 05:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
we do a straight repeal in a ban and
 
05:18:31.080 --> 05:18:31.948 align:start position:0%
we do a straight repeal in a ban and
then

05:18:31.948 --> 05:18:31.958 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:18:34.270 --> 05:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
um and then if there's possible to have
 
05:18:36.628 --> 05:18:36.638 align:start position:0%
a study committee that would be great I
 
05:18:38.430 --> 05:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
also wanted to say that the bill
 
05:18:39.548 --> 05:18:39.558 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't have been in your
 
05:18:41.750 --> 05:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
committee it should have been in mine in
 
05:18:44.270 --> 05:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture that's where
 
05:18:48.830 --> 05:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
12f the law originated from so um and
 
05:18:50.910 --> 05:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
this is really it's it's it goes hand
 
05:18:52.750 --> 05:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
inand we're talking about pollution in
 
05:18:54.628 --> 05:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
the environment and then there's the
 
05:18:56.788 --> 05:18:56.798 align:start position:0%
technology piece where you guys are at
 
05:18:59.510 --> 05:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
so um you know I spoke to the speaker
 
05:19:02.990 --> 05:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
about this as well and he stood but you
 
05:19:04.788 --> 05:19:04.798 align:start position:0%
know knowing technicalities and stuff
 
05:19:07.190 --> 05:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
like that it was already here so uh I
 
05:19:08.590 --> 05:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
just wanted everybody to know that I'm
 
05:19:10.270 --> 05:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
going to be doing that in regards with
 
05:19:13.270 --> 05:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
an amendment um and then the other
 
05:19:16.350 --> 05:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
handout that I just gave was pretty much
 
05:19:17.990 --> 05:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
just showed you and I'm going to send
 
05:19:19.948 --> 05:19:19.958 align:start position:0%
you this in color because it's it's just
 
05:19:21.868 --> 05:19:21.878 align:start position:0%
really some of the pictures that you've
 
05:19:23.948 --> 05:19:23.958 align:start position:0%
got are going to really look exactly
 
05:19:26.510 --> 05:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
like this and this is right from um
 
05:19:29.430 --> 05:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
scientific America or I think it is
 
05:19:31.270 --> 05:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's what it's called and um from the
 
05:19:33.470 --> 05:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
the UN a picture of exactly what we see
 
05:19:36.868 --> 05:19:36.878 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire so um I think
 
05:19:38.190 --> 05:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much
 
05:19:40.708 --> 05:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
it thank you do you
 
05:19:44.590 --> 05:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
know from your work on uh environment
 
05:19:47.868 --> 05:19:47.878 align:start position:0%
and egg and or research you've done
 
05:19:51.948 --> 05:19:51.958 align:start position:0%
through OS why did RSA 12f get passed in
 
05:19:53.070 --> 05:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
the first
 
05:19:54.948 --> 05:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
place okay
 
05:20:00.430 --> 05:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
so so when so 12f came in in 1985 and
 
05:20:02.510 --> 05:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I can give you legislation from
 
05:20:05.548 --> 05:20:05.558 align:start position:0%
other states in regards with saying okay
 
05:20:07.510 --> 05:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know we can we can modify the
 
05:20:09.830 --> 05:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
weather and really without any consent
 
05:20:11.628 --> 05:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't have the history of
 
05:20:13.310 --> 05:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
that but I can tell you the history that
 
05:20:15.110 --> 05:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
it actually took place with a whole
 
05:20:17.070 --> 05:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
bunch of States at the same time in
 
05:20:19.868 --> 05:20:19.878 align:start position:0%
regards with I think there's 19 states
 
05:20:23.350 --> 05:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
that have a weather modification bill in
 
05:20:28.470 --> 05:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
2021 is when chairman Aaron put in that
 
05:20:32.190 --> 05:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
um that Amendment it and it was great
 
05:20:33.990 --> 05:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
and it passed but for
 
05:20:36.230 --> 05:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
notification and everyone's saying okay
 
05:20:37.990 --> 05:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
well Dees comes up and says oh we'd have
 
05:20:39.750 --> 05:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
to have staff and all we wouldn't have
 
05:20:42.150 --> 05:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
to have any of that so it should have
 
05:20:45.628 --> 05:20:45.638 align:start position:0%
started right away where um you know if
 
05:20:46.868 --> 05:20:46.878 align:start position:0%
it's the gentleman that's under
 
05:20:49.590 --> 05:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
monitoring the air and stuff like that
 
05:20:51.548 --> 05:20:51.558 align:start position:0%
uh he just should have been asking
 
05:20:53.830 --> 05:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
several different federal agencies what
 
05:20:55.150 --> 05:20:55.160 align:start position:0%
they were doing if they were doing
 
05:20:57.150 --> 05:20:57.160 align:start position:0%
anything in New Hampshire that but that
 
05:20:59.470 --> 05:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
has not happened so we can demand that
 
05:21:01.430 --> 05:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
to happen because it is a loss so we can
 
05:21:02.910 --> 05:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
ask the federal government what they
 
05:21:04.070 --> 05:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
have been doing in New Hampshire which
 
05:21:06.548 --> 05:21:06.558 align:start position:0%
is great but I think in the meantime
 
05:21:08.390 --> 05:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
before the people consent I think we
 
05:21:11.110 --> 05:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
repeal the law I I I don't think we have
 
05:21:12.628 --> 05:21:12.638 align:start position:0%
to get into the weeds because I know a
 
05:21:14.270 --> 05:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
lot of you are like how can we do this
 
05:21:16.548 --> 05:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
and this wouldn't work and I think we
 
05:21:19.270 --> 05:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
repeal it and then um if there's a study
 
05:21:21.310 --> 05:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
committee that we can do and then put
 
05:21:24.310 --> 05:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
some Protections in place as well and I
 
05:21:27.390 --> 05:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
also wanted to say too that I have found
 
05:21:30.670 --> 05:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
no information at all uh it pretty much
 
05:21:33.150 --> 05:21:33.160 align:start position:0%
it's from the 1940s and 50s the cloud
 
05:21:35.750 --> 05:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
seating is about in the midwest it never
 
05:21:38.510 --> 05:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
came over to here in New Hampshire so if
 
05:21:40.470 --> 05:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh it's just weird that the timing of
 
05:21:43.350 --> 05:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't go with the 1985 either and
 
05:21:45.270 --> 05:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you I I was you know I think
 
05:21:46.868 --> 05:21:46.878 align:start position:0%
I sent the document to you like one in
 
05:21:50.230 --> 05:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
the morning um I'm no scientist but I
 
05:21:52.788 --> 05:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
know a lot about this now so and it's
 
05:21:56.628 --> 05:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
all from unbelievable Federal documents
 
05:21:59.230 --> 05:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
everything that I sent you is uh there
 
05:22:01.868 --> 05:22:01.878 align:start position:0%
is no there's no question it's all and I
 
05:22:03.548 --> 05:22:03.558 align:start position:0%
did all the administrations so you can
 
05:22:05.910 --> 05:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
see going back to Bush all the way up to
 
05:22:08.628 --> 05:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
current day and this is under every
 
05:22:10.788 --> 05:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
Administration this is a nonpartisan
 
05:22:12.430 --> 05:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
thing and we really need to know what's
 
05:22:17.110 --> 05:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
going on okay great thank you very much
 
05:22:17.120 --> 05:22:18.750 align:start position:0%
going on okay great thank you very much
all

05:22:18.750 --> 05:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:22:22.310 --> 05:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
right you have a uh rep Vice chair
 
05:22:25.270 --> 05:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a comment yes uh just for
 
05:22:28.310 --> 05:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
clarification are are you um in in
 
05:22:29.868 --> 05:22:29.878 align:start position:0%
reference to your comment about the
 
05:22:31.310 --> 05:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
where the bill should have been are you
 
05:22:34.708 --> 05:22:34.718 align:start position:0%
aware that in general any bill that has
 
05:22:36.990 --> 05:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
to do with air pollution comes to
 
05:22:39.430 --> 05:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
Science and Tech and energy any bill
 
05:22:40.830 --> 05:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
that has to do with water pollution
 
05:22:43.310 --> 05:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
usually goes to Resource and Recreation
 
05:22:45.030 --> 05:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
just as a matter of information so
 
05:22:47.070 --> 05:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
that's most likely the way the bill was
 
05:22:49.390 --> 05:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
written with all of the references to
 
05:22:52.270 --> 05:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
the sky pollution uh that's most likely
 
05:22:56.070 --> 05:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:58.470 --> 05:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
here representative Gard you have a
 
05:23:00.590 --> 05:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
question please come up to the table
 
05:23:00.600 --> 05:23:03.110 align:start position:0%
question please come up to the table
yeah

05:23:03.110 --> 05:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:04.868 --> 05:23:04.878 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to take any time uh
 
05:23:06.628 --> 05:23:06.638 align:start position:0%
representative Gart Northfield Franklin
 
05:23:07.670 --> 05:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to take any time for
 
05:23:08.708 --> 05:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
people that drove all the way here to
 
05:23:09.830 --> 05:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
testify so I was going to wait till the
 
05:23:12.708 --> 05:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
end I just wanted to two minutes you can
 
05:23:14.670 --> 05:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
put on a timer I just wanted to address
 
05:23:16.350 --> 05:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
a couple things from that White House
 
05:23:17.830 --> 05:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
report then I'll leave you guys alone
 
05:23:19.948 --> 05:23:19.958 align:start position:0%
make up few decisions I just think it's
 
05:23:21.230 --> 05:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
I got here a little bit late so if I'm
 
05:23:22.628 --> 05:23:22.638 align:start position:0%
repeating testimony I get stuck at
 
05:23:25.070 --> 05:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
federal court they deal with some uh
 
05:23:27.230 --> 05:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
federal court transparency issues on the
 
05:23:31.430 --> 05:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
clock good let's go so page 15 of that
 
05:23:32.750 --> 05:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
White House document that you've all
 
05:23:34.150 --> 05:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
been sent a million times probably by
 
05:23:36.788 --> 05:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
now the unintended outcomes of solar
 
05:23:38.190 --> 05:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
radiation management what I'm concerned
 
05:23:40.270 --> 05:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
about if it is or isn't happening that
 
05:23:41.788 --> 05:23:41.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter we're worried more
 
05:23:43.430 --> 05:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
about what could happen and they admit
 
05:23:45.510 --> 05:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
it in their own documents quote a
 
05:23:47.350 --> 05:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
variety of unintended outcomes of SRM
 
05:23:48.868 --> 05:23:48.878 align:start position:0%
are not well understood and there may be

others of which we are not aware the
 
05:23:52.590 --> 05:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
known unknowns include potential changes
 
05:23:54.350 --> 05:23:54.360 align:start position:0%

05:24:07.910 --> 05:24:07.920 align:start position:0%

05:24:09.190 --> 05:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
such as more frequent drought
 
05:24:11.270 --> 05:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
precipitation events next paragraph gaps
 
05:24:13.470 --> 05:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
remain in our understanding of how SRM
 
05:24:16.310 --> 05:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
deployments might irreversibly alter the
 
05:24:18.868 --> 05:24:18.878 align:start position:0%
earth's climate system so why are we
 
05:24:21.110 --> 05:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
doing this anyway the long-term risks of
 
05:24:22.948 --> 05:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
SRM deployments should be evaluated
 
05:24:25.110 --> 05:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
using a risk vers risk approach since
 
05:24:27.150 --> 05:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
SRM potentially prevent or amarate some
 
05:24:29.150 --> 05:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
of the irreversible impacts of global
 
05:24:30.390 --> 05:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
warming which we've never actually
 
05:24:32.190 --> 05:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
established L but the point being is
 
05:24:33.470 --> 05:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
they're admitting they're playing with
 
05:24:35.510 --> 05:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
fire and we're told don't worry the
 
05:24:37.670 --> 05:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
federal government has it under control
 
05:24:39.628 --> 05:24:39.638 align:start position:0%
so I don't trust the federal government
 
05:24:41.868 --> 05:24:41.878 align:start position:0%
and I think no one else should so I
 
05:24:43.470 --> 05:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate you guys really taking a
 
05:24:45.910 --> 05:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
serious look at this and I know I
 
05:24:48.670 --> 05:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
brought it forward but it was just by
 
05:24:50.990 --> 05:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
chance so take me out of the equation
 
05:24:52.270 --> 05:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
and just look at the bill on its own
 
05:24:54.030 --> 05:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
merits and we are totally open to
 
05:24:55.430 --> 05:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
working with it but I do not want this
 
05:24:57.270 --> 05:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
to end up in some NeverEnding study
 
05:24:59.310 --> 05:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
committee that never goes anywhere we've
 
05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
already seen how the 5G commission went
 
05:25:04.190 --> 05:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
so um I would like to get a law that
 
05:25:05.948 --> 05:25:05.958 align:start position:0%
actually stops this experimentation on
 
05:25:08.070 --> 05:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
the books however we have to do it but
 
05:25:09.628 --> 05:25:09.638 align:start position:0%
it has to have teeth because otherwise
 
05:25:10.948 --> 05:25:10.958 align:start position:0%
we're just wasting our time so that's
 
05:25:12.470 --> 05:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
all I wanted to say thank you very much
 
05:25:14.868 --> 05:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
and I'll let whatever if you we're going
 
05:25:16.948 --> 05:25:16.958 align:start position:0%
to address the committee okay thank you
 
05:25:16.958 --> 05:25:18.190 align:start position:0%
to address the committee okay thank you
appreciate

05:25:18.190 --> 05:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
05:25:20.910 --> 05:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
that representative I am not taking I
 
05:25:21.868 --> 05:25:21.878 align:start position:0%
just don't want to get trapped up in a
 
05:25:24.510 --> 05:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
cycle of never ending this he he doesn't
 
05:25:26.110 --> 05:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
want to take a
 
05:25:29.708 --> 05:25:29.718 align:start position:0%
question no all right so representative
 
05:25:33.910 --> 05:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:37.548 --> 05:25:37.558 align:start position:0%
committee thank you chairman BS um and
 
05:25:40.390 --> 05:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
once again my question was I see a lot
 
05:25:43.070 --> 05:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
of this document
 
05:25:46.070 --> 05:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
documentation footnotes much of it is
 
05:25:46.080 --> 05:25:47.590 align:start position:0%
documentation footnotes much of it is
government

05:25:47.590 --> 05:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:25:47.600 --> 05:25:49.430 align:start position:0%
government
documentation

05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
05:25:52.270 --> 05:25:52.280 align:start position:0%
um and when we come to
 
05:25:56.708 --> 05:25:56.718 align:start position:0%
the uh exec before we come to that I was
 
05:25:58.470 --> 05:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
wondering about a work session to at
 
05:26:01.150 --> 05:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
least go over we have citizens who come
 
05:26:04.030 --> 05:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
to us with they see a concern they ask
 
05:26:05.628 --> 05:26:05.638 align:start position:0%
for their help and they gave us
 
05:26:07.750 --> 05:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
documentations all I'm asking is can we
 
05:26:09.070 --> 05:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
look at at
 
05:26:13.030 --> 05:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
least the government and um
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
organizations like Noah documentation I
 
05:26:17.788 --> 05:26:17.798 align:start position:0%
have a bunch in front of
 
05:26:22.070 --> 05:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
me thank you chair okay so you may not
 
05:26:24.270 --> 05:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
have seen it yet because I think it was
 
05:26:28.190 --> 05:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
just posted this morning but on Tuesday
 
05:26:30.670 --> 05:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
January thir 30th we are having a work
 
05:26:33.430 --> 05:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
session on this and four other bills
 
05:26:35.350 --> 05:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
prior to an executive
 
05:26:38.270 --> 05:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
session so yes we will have a work
 
05:26:40.430 --> 05:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
session on this
 
05:26:43.470 --> 05:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
bill all right so with that we'll close
 
05:26:46.868 --> 05:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
this public hearing on House Bill 1700
 
05:26:51.190 --> 05:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
FN and we will start a public hearing on
 
05:26:51.200 --> 05:26:52.708 align:start position:0%
FN and we will start a public hearing on
HB

05:26:52.708 --> 05:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
HB
 
05:26:59.510 --> 05:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:59.520 --> 05:34:22.230 align:start position:0%
 
break

05:34:22.230 --> 05:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:24.110 --> 05:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
okay please take your seats ladies and
 
05:34:27.150 --> 05:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
gentlemen time to get back to work I'm
 
05:34:30.110 --> 05:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
going to open a public hearing on House
 
05:34:34.350 --> 05:34:34.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 1472 FN relative to rebates of
 
05:34:37.110 --> 05:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency funds for electric
 
05:34:39.590 --> 05:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles and I'm going to introduce the
 
05:34:42.230 --> 05:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this legislation
 
05:34:44.830 --> 05:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
representative Rebecca McWilliams to
 
05:34:48.230 --> 05:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
introduce it to us all yours Rebecca
 
05:34:50.150 --> 05:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you very much chair
 
05:34:51.948 --> 05:34:51.958 align:start position:0%
Vose it's a pleasure to be here I feel
 
05:34:55.110 --> 05:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
like I'm on home turf with friends um
 
05:34:57.750 --> 05:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
and uh if I haven't given my intro to
 
05:35:00.910 --> 05:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
you yet um I represent South conquered
 
05:35:02.590 --> 05:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
and you are in one of my districts right
 
05:35:04.470 --> 05:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
now so it is a pleasure to host you
 
05:35:06.270 --> 05:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
within my own home
 
05:35:09.788 --> 05:35:09.798 align:start position:0%
District um so with that being said uh
 
05:35:11.350 --> 05:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
this is House Bill
 
05:35:13.708 --> 05:35:13.718 align:start position:0%
1472 uh the focus of this bill is very
 
05:35:17.350 --> 05:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
simple The Proposal is a twoyear pilot
 
05:35:18.708 --> 05:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
uh administered by the department of
 
05:35:22.548 --> 05:35:22.558 align:start position:0%
energy uh looking at taking $3 million a
 
05:35:24.990 --> 05:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
year of Reggie funds and applying it to
 
05:35:27.430 --> 05:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle incentives um this has
 
05:35:29.430 --> 05:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
been done in other states I'm going to
 
05:35:30.868 --> 05:35:30.878 align:start position:0%
look at the Connecticut program
 
05:35:32.750 --> 05:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
specifically as part of my testimony but
 
05:35:36.030 --> 05:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
this is not an uncommon thing to do um
 
05:35:37.750 --> 05:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
and also we'll talk a little bit about
 
05:35:39.830 --> 05:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
Reggie and uh what we're currently doing
 
05:35:41.150 --> 05:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
with Reggie and what we could be doing
 
05:35:43.430 --> 05:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
with Reggie money um so that's that's
 
05:35:44.948 --> 05:35:44.958 align:start position:0%
really the intent of the bill is to take
 
05:35:46.670 --> 05:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
some dollars from Reggie and direct it
 
05:35:49.110 --> 05:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
towards EV um cash in the hood incentive
 
05:35:51.708 --> 05:35:51.718 align:start position:0%
purchase uh dollars all right so let's
 
05:35:53.110 --> 05:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about
 
05:35:53.120 --> 05:35:55.548 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about
Reggie

05:35:55.548 --> 05:35:55.558 align:start position:0%
Reggie
 
05:35:59.510 --> 05:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
um based on the 2021 data um and I've
 
05:36:01.150 --> 05:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
I've provided some handouts if you
 
05:36:02.788 --> 05:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
really want to get in the weeds I don't
 
05:36:04.788 --> 05:36:04.798 align:start position:0%
intend to get really in the weeds but
 
05:36:06.948 --> 05:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of read reading material
 
05:36:10.830 --> 05:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
here on um both the full Reggie report
 
05:36:13.470 --> 05:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
which is a gray bar across the front the
 
05:36:16.110 --> 05:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
investment of Reggie proceeds in 2021
 
05:36:18.910 --> 05:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
published June 2023 reggie. org this is
 
05:36:20.628 --> 05:36:20.638 align:start position:0%
available online you can also look at
 
05:36:23.030 --> 05:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
the paper copy I've handed out um this
 
05:36:25.230 --> 05:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
goes into depth about what other states
 
05:36:27.030 --> 05:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
besides New Hampshire are doing with
 
05:36:29.910 --> 05:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
Reggie dollars because um I'm might
 
05:36:31.628 --> 05:36:31.638 align:start position:0%
posit that we're not being very creative
 
05:36:32.910 --> 05:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
with what we're currently doing with our
 
05:36:36.270 --> 05:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
Reggie funds um the second uh is dated
 
05:36:39.030 --> 05:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
November 8 2022 it's from our own New
 
05:36:40.948 --> 05:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
05:36:44.070 --> 05:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
Services uh and this is a Reggie annual
 
05:36:47.868 --> 05:36:47.878 align:start position:0%
report um also based on our past Year's
 
05:36:49.510 --> 05:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
data uh
 
05:36:52.470 --> 05:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
2021 uh looking just at uh how we did as
 
05:36:54.708 --> 05:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
a state where did we spend our money um
 
05:36:57.070 --> 05:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
and what are the trends moving forward
 
05:36:59.190 --> 05:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
um so this is this is sort of the basis
 
05:37:00.948 --> 05:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
of my thesis but you don't actually need
 
05:37:02.390 --> 05:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
to look at these citations this is good
 
05:37:05.548 --> 05:37:05.558 align:start position:0%
bedtime with wine reading all right so
 
05:37:06.948 --> 05:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
05:37:10.270 --> 05:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
summary uh New Hampshire's 2021 uh
 
05:37:13.990 --> 05:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
Reggie funds we had 33 million in Reggie
 
05:37:17.708 --> 05:37:17.718 align:start position:0%
allowance proceeds uh from our our large
 
05:37:20.030 --> 05:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh emitters who contributed to the
 
05:37:25.788 --> 05:37:25.798 align:start position:0%
program of that 33 million um we we took
 
05:37:30.190 --> 05:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
approximately 29.6 million and we use
 
05:37:32.548 --> 05:37:32.558 align:start position:0%
that to provide direct bill assistance
 
05:37:34.628 --> 05:37:34.638 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire Electric
 
05:37:38.868 --> 05:37:38.878 align:start position:0%
consumers so that's the Lion Share 29.6
 
05:37:41.470 --> 05:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
million out of 33 million was directly
 
05:37:43.270 --> 05:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
to our electric
 
05:37:45.990 --> 05:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
consumers um another 50,000 was
 
05:37:48.230 --> 05:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
allocated to Energy Efficiency program
 
05:37:49.910 --> 05:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
focusing on moderate Inc income
 
05:37:51.510 --> 05:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
households New Hampshire saves among
 
05:37:53.868 --> 05:37:53.878 align:start position:0%
other programs um and then finally the
 
05:37:54.990 --> 05:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
remaining auction proceeds of
 
05:37:58.270 --> 05:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
approximately 200,000 covered related
 
05:38:00.628 --> 05:38:00.638 align:start position:0%
Reggie administrative expenses so paying
 
05:38:02.910 --> 05:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
for staff to manage these funds coming
 
05:38:06.910 --> 05:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
in and out of the program so um that's
 
05:38:08.948 --> 05:38:08.958 align:start position:0%
what New Hampshire has been doing with
 
05:38:11.910 --> 05:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh Reggie funds and this proposal for
 
05:38:15.628 --> 05:38:15.638 align:start position:0%
this bill is to take another $3 million
 
05:38:17.310 --> 05:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
that we're not currently using that is
 
05:38:20.070 --> 05:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
part of the 29.6 million being refunded
 
05:38:22.910 --> 05:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
to the electric consumers and instead
 
05:38:25.548 --> 05:38:25.558 align:start position:0%
directed over a 2-year period um to
 
05:38:28.190 --> 05:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
purchasing uh to helping people purchase
 
05:38:31.470 --> 05:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
EVS so um the precedent for this is the
 
05:38:33.910 --> 05:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Cash on the hood program um
 
05:38:36.750 --> 05:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
I have another really thick reference
 
05:38:39.830 --> 05:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
this is the Conneticut chap PR annual
 
05:38:41.310 --> 05:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
report I haven't passed this out to
 
05:38:42.590 --> 05:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
everyone but you can look it up if you
 
05:38:43.708 --> 05:38:43.718 align:start position:0%
want to get into the Weeds about
 
05:38:45.788 --> 05:38:45.798 align:start position:0%
Connecticut's program I will give one
 
05:38:47.708 --> 05:38:47.718 align:start position:0%
for the record it's another thick
 
05:38:50.030 --> 05:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
document um so just to summarize the
 
05:38:53.110 --> 05:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
Connecticut cheaper program in 2020
 
05:38:54.670 --> 05:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
Connecticut adopted legislation
 
05:38:57.070 --> 05:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
codifying the cheaper pilot program
 
05:38:59.548 --> 05:38:59.558 align:start position:0%
which provides $3 million in funding per
 
05:39:02.510 --> 05:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
year for six years um so it's been
 
05:39:03.788 --> 05:39:03.798 align:start position:0%
codified into
 
05:39:06.390 --> 05:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
law uh it initially consisted of three
 
05:39:08.590 --> 05:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
different incentives um it's a point of
 
05:39:10.270 --> 05:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
sale rebate that means the money is
 
05:39:11.948 --> 05:39:11.958 align:start position:0%
offered as cash on the hood and
 
05:39:13.670 --> 05:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
immediately reduces the purchase price
 
05:39:15.590 --> 05:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
of the vehicle and this is important
 
05:39:17.110 --> 05:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
people are much more likely to buy if
 
05:39:18.750 --> 05:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
they can immediately get a discount at
 
05:39:20.750 --> 05:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
the dealership rather than waiting until
 
05:39:22.590 --> 05:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
they file their taxes to get some kind
 
05:39:24.350 --> 05:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
of money later on in the year or the
 
05:39:24.360 --> 05:39:27.948 align:start position:0%
of money later on in the year or the
following

05:39:27.948 --> 05:39:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:30.310 --> 05:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
year uh there are also Al participate in
 
05:39:32.430 --> 05:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
Connecticut automotive dealers so they
 
05:39:34.910 --> 05:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
had to opt in to be uh Sellers as part
 
05:39:38.510 --> 05:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
of the cheaper program um and it the
 
05:39:41.310 --> 05:39:41.320 align:start position:0%
rebate is based on elig income eligible
 
05:39:43.750 --> 05:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
qualified purchasers or lessies of new
 
05:39:47.548 --> 05:39:47.558 align:start position:0%
EVS um it also includes used EVS so we
 
05:39:49.350 --> 05:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
do have a used market for EVS in New
 
05:39:51.110 --> 05:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well it's just starting up
 
05:39:52.548 --> 05:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
but it's starting to become much more
 
05:39:54.708 --> 05:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
popular um we're seeing that it's a
 
05:39:56.708 --> 05:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
common car for teenagers if you have a
 
05:39:58.708 --> 05:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
16-year-old who's only going to be a
 
05:40:01.270 --> 05:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
local driver or purchasing a used EV is
 
05:40:05.270 --> 05:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
becoming um the thing to do um finally
 
05:40:07.910 --> 05:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
in Connecticut's program the incentives
 
05:40:09.628 --> 05:40:09.638 align:start position:0%
are paid directly to the consumers who
 
05:40:11.750 --> 05:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
apply um after they've done the purchase
 
05:40:13.310 --> 05:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
or lease documents so they need to
 
05:40:16.670 --> 05:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
submit the documents get the money
 
05:40:20.230 --> 05:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
um Connecticut had a uh a goal of
 
05:40:22.270 --> 05:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
achieving a certain percentage uh they
 
05:40:25.548 --> 05:40:25.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to get up to I believe it was
 
05:40:28.868 --> 05:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
250,000 EVS on the road by 2030 so this
 
05:40:30.708 --> 05:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
program is is part of a state goal to
 
05:40:32.910 --> 05:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
get there um and we're we're not
 
05:40:34.868 --> 05:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
currently based on a state goal in New
 
05:40:36.390 --> 05:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we could talk about what
 
05:40:39.628 --> 05:40:39.638 align:start position:0%
is our ideal for implementing more EVS
 
05:40:41.350 --> 05:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
if we were to set a goal that's not part
 
05:40:43.868 --> 05:40:43.878 align:start position:0%
of this bill but it's a distinguishment
 
05:40:45.430 --> 05:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
um finally the Connecticut Cash on the
 
05:40:49.030 --> 05:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
hood program is between $500 and $1,500
 
05:40:51.830 --> 05:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
per electrified vehicle and that depends
 
05:40:54.230 --> 05:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
on the battery range so if it has a 200
 
05:40:56.430 --> 05:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
mile or greater battery range then they
 
05:40:59.750 --> 05:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
get, 1500 if it's 200 or less 5 00 if
 
05:41:02.708 --> 05:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
it's a plug-in hybrid also 500 so that's
 
05:41:05.430 --> 05:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
both electricity and gas for the plug-in
 
05:41:08.190 --> 05:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
hybrid um so that's just in a nutshell a
 
05:41:09.230 --> 05:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
summary of what's happening in
 
05:41:12.270 --> 05:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
Connecticut with the cheaper program all
 
05:41:14.990 --> 05:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
right so uh the purpose of this bill why
 
05:41:17.628 --> 05:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
are we talking about this New Hampshire
 
05:41:20.670 --> 05:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
as we know we have struggled every year
 
05:41:22.390 --> 05:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
in the winter with intermittent
 
05:41:24.430 --> 05:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
electricity and electricity outages
 
05:41:26.310 --> 05:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
right we have big storms trees go over
 
05:41:28.750 --> 05:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
the lines we run out of power we're out
 
05:41:30.750 --> 05:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
for a day or two or three and we're just
 
05:41:32.230 --> 05:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
waiting for the lines to get repaired to
 
05:41:34.990 --> 05:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
get back on the grid um I've handed out
 
05:41:37.190 --> 05:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
an article from The Washington Post that
 
05:41:39.110 --> 05:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
states electric vehicles can now power
 
05:41:41.750 --> 05:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
your home for 3 days so instead of
 
05:41:43.190 --> 05:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
having to go out and purchase a
 
05:41:45.708 --> 05:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
generator every couple of years uh when
 
05:41:48.510 --> 05:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
it no longer works or kicks the bucket
 
05:41:51.350 --> 05:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
um you could actually use your vehicle
 
05:41:53.628 --> 05:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
and the article talks about using a Ford
 
05:41:54.990 --> 05:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
but I really don't want to say that's
 
05:41:57.150 --> 05:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
the only vehicle you can use just the
 
05:41:59.430 --> 05:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
example here is a Ford F-150 that can
 
05:42:01.310 --> 05:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
use to power your home while the power
 
05:42:03.830 --> 05:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
is out um so that you can still keep
 
05:42:06.548 --> 05:42:06.558 align:start position:0%
things running like your refrigerator or
 
05:42:09.030 --> 05:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
if you're like me your modem and your
 
05:42:11.670 --> 05:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
laptop um so that you can keep yourself
 
05:42:13.990 --> 05:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
in business even without the power uh
 
05:42:15.948 --> 05:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
functioning and so really what this is
 
05:42:17.830 --> 05:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
about is energy Independence we're
 
05:42:20.070 --> 05:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
talking about the plan for the next 10
 
05:42:21.910 --> 05:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
15 20 years for the State of New
 
05:42:23.868 --> 05:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and what can we do to be
 
05:42:25.910 --> 05:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
independent knowing that it's going to
 
05:42:27.868 --> 05:42:27.878 align:start position:0%
take a very long time for us to have
 
05:42:30.310 --> 05:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
either micro grids or up our grids but
 
05:42:32.868 --> 05:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about combining EVS
 
05:42:34.750 --> 05:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
with generators then it's a whole
 
05:42:37.468 --> 05:42:37.478 align:start position:0%
different ball game right so the idea
 
05:42:38.510 --> 05:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
here is to be a little bit like
 
05:42:41.070 --> 05:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
Nostradamus and look into the future who
 
05:42:43.150 --> 05:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
do we want to be what do we want to do
 
05:42:45.230 --> 05:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
as a state how can we incentivize the
 
05:42:47.390 --> 05:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
behavior so that people can be
 
05:42:49.468 --> 05:42:49.478 align:start position:0%
independent and so that's really the
 
05:42:50.948 --> 05:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
pieces that I wanted to put together to
 
05:42:52.910 --> 05:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill for you and with
 
05:42:56.548 --> 05:42:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:58.788 --> 05:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative I
 
05:43:01.548 --> 05:43:01.558 align:start position:0%
have to say I love the uh cash on the
 
05:43:04.750 --> 05:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
hood uh slogan for this bill it's very
 
05:43:04.760 --> 05:43:05.750 align:start position:0%
hood uh slogan for this bill it's very
very

05:43:05.750 --> 05:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:43:10.030 --> 05:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
clever so I do have a question though
 
05:43:13.910 --> 05:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
sure part of our job when we write bills
 
05:43:16.270 --> 05:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
as policy makers is to develop a policy
 
05:43:19.510 --> 05:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
that can be implemented by the people we
 
05:43:22.230 --> 05:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
ask to implement those policies so I'm
 
05:43:25.670 --> 05:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
curious to know on p on lines 8
 
05:43:28.868 --> 05:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
n eight and nine of the bill it says
 
05:43:31.548 --> 05:43:31.558 align:start position:0%
that that the department of energy shall
 
05:43:34.150 --> 05:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
develop and Implement a so-called cash
 
05:43:36.270 --> 05:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
on the hood program for point of sale
 
05:43:39.150 --> 05:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle rebates to
 
05:43:41.868 --> 05:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
buyers but it doesn't give
 
05:43:44.230 --> 05:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
any direction to the Department of
 
05:43:45.948 --> 05:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
energy for
 
05:43:49.110 --> 05:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
example what would the rebate be now you
 
05:43:51.548 --> 05:43:51.558 align:start position:0%
cited that Connecticut had a range of 5
 
05:43:53.150 --> 05:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
to 1500
 
05:43:55.590 --> 05:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
but would the department of energy know
 
05:43:57.948 --> 05:43:57.958 align:start position:0%
that um it the bill doesn't make any
 
05:44:01.270 --> 05:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
reference whatso ever to what the rebate
 
05:44:04.548 --> 05:44:04.558 align:start position:0%
should be nor is there any instruction
 
05:44:07.510 --> 05:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
to the department about how to set up a
 
05:44:10.948 --> 05:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
rebate program I mean would it go to the
 
05:44:13.468 --> 05:44:13.478 align:start position:0%
dealer would it go directly to the to
 
05:44:17.590 --> 05:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
the customer how would it all work um do
 
05:44:19.190 --> 05:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
you think maybe that should have been
 
05:44:22.390 --> 05:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
specified in the legislation uh thank
 
05:44:23.590 --> 05:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
you very much for the question chair
 
05:44:25.510 --> 05:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
Vose um on on both
 
05:44:27.430 --> 05:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
fronts I think I would look to the
 
05:44:29.390 --> 05:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
Connecticut President right the the 5 to
 
05:44:32.548 --> 05:44:32.558 align:start position:0%
1500 seems to be the going rate is um
 
05:44:35.310 --> 05:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
and also how how does it work in
 
05:44:36.708 --> 05:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
Connecticut you need to sign the
 
05:44:39.150 --> 05:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
documents and it has to last for 30 days
 
05:44:41.750 --> 05:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
in order for you to get your dollars so
 
05:44:43.708 --> 05:44:43.718 align:start position:0%
after 30 days in Connecticut you can't
 
05:44:45.868 --> 05:44:45.878 align:start position:0%
return a vehicle to the dealer and still
 
05:44:48.310 --> 05:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
have your your purchase price honored um
 
05:44:50.070 --> 05:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure because I'm not in the
 
05:44:51.910 --> 05:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
business of Automotive dealing in New
 
05:44:53.750 --> 05:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I understand that we do
 
05:44:55.670 --> 05:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
have certain laws that we would want to
 
05:44:57.548 --> 05:44:57.558 align:start position:0%
follow in terms of if someone purchases
 
05:44:59.670 --> 05:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
an EV and then has buyers Morse the next
 
05:45:01.270 --> 05:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
day or the next week they wouldn't be
 
05:45:03.430 --> 05:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
able to get their rebate and get around
 
05:45:06.190 --> 05:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
this right um th this was somewhat
 
05:45:07.868 --> 05:45:07.878 align:start position:0%
intentional to allow the department of
 
05:45:09.910 --> 05:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
energy latitude to do the adoption
 
05:45:11.230 --> 05:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
without us putting a whole bunch of
 
05:45:13.230 --> 05:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
strings attached I I was keeping it
 
05:45:15.590 --> 05:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
vague on purpose but I'm also open to
 
05:45:16.990 --> 05:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
doing an amendment that puts some guard
 
05:45:18.510 --> 05:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
rails on there to make sure that the
 
05:45:20.230 --> 05:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
department of energy is not giving one
 
05:45:22.708 --> 05:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
buyer something like $10,000 right I
 
05:45:24.590 --> 05:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
think that would be way outside what's
 
05:45:26.708 --> 05:45:26.718 align:start position:0%
normal for this program so I'm happy to
 
05:45:28.270 --> 05:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
amend it to address those two issues
 
05:45:29.670 --> 05:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:45:32.270 --> 05:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
so RSA 541a the administrative
 
05:45:35.190 --> 05:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
procedures law basically says that
 
05:45:37.350 --> 05:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
agencies can't develop
 
05:45:40.548 --> 05:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
rules unless there is legislation that
 
05:45:43.230 --> 05:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
specifically authorizes the rules so for
 
05:45:45.548 --> 05:45:45.558 align:start position:0%
them to set up a
 
05:45:47.510 --> 05:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
program which would have to be
 
05:45:49.868 --> 05:45:49.878 align:start position:0%
administered through rules we would have
 
05:45:51.110 --> 05:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
to give them
 
05:45:53.670 --> 05:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
explicit instructions and legislation
 
05:45:55.708 --> 05:45:55.718 align:start position:0%
about what rules they could write
 
05:45:55.718 --> 05:45:56.830 align:start position:0%
about what rules they could write
wouldn't

05:45:56.830 --> 05:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
05:45:59.350 --> 05:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
we you know I've seen an awful lot of
 
05:46:01.708 --> 05:46:01.718 align:start position:0%
things pass out of out of the house and
 
05:46:03.468 --> 05:46:03.478 align:start position:0%
get signed by the governor that I don't
 
05:46:06.110 --> 05:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
consider to be particularly explicit
 
05:46:07.670 --> 05:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
I've done a lot of work in child care in
 
05:46:09.350 --> 05:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
the last six years and much of it has
 
05:46:11.310 --> 05:46:11.320 align:start position:0%
been just guidelines and then the rules
 
05:46:13.110 --> 05:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
that were promulgated were were sort of
 
05:46:16.590 --> 05:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
a negotiation after the legislation was
 
05:46:19.548 --> 05:46:19.558 align:start position:0%
signed um so I'm not saying that we want
 
05:46:22.468 --> 05:46:22.478 align:start position:0%
this to be like that but I have seen
 
05:46:25.270 --> 05:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
some more vague language be acceptable
 
05:46:26.910 --> 05:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
and I agree with you that we could be a
 
05:46:29.670 --> 05:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
lot more guard railed about the way this
 
05:46:32.390 --> 05:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
is set up okay the department of energy
 
05:46:34.990 --> 05:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
is going to testify later so maybe
 
05:46:37.390 --> 05:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
they'll have some ideas on this
 
05:46:39.150 --> 05:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
05:46:42.628 --> 05:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
question um actually I think you asked
 
05:46:46.990 --> 05:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
my question but um my concern was along
 
05:46:49.590 --> 05:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
the lines of of who
 
05:46:53.150 --> 05:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
decides the amount for each situation
 
05:46:54.468 --> 05:46:54.478 align:start position:0%
and I'm hearing you say that it should
 
05:46:56.708 --> 05:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
be based on on the Connecticut
 
05:46:59.948 --> 05:46:59.958 align:start position:0%
guidelines is that is that correct
 
05:47:01.350 --> 05:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
so there are other seats doing it
 
05:47:03.070 --> 05:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
besides Connecticut but it seems like
 
05:47:05.708 --> 05:47:05.718 align:start position:0%
Connecticut was fairly reasonable um we
 
05:47:07.548 --> 05:47:07.558 align:start position:0%
could certainly do a deep dive into
 
05:47:09.270 --> 05:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
other states that have also done this
 
05:47:11.190 --> 05:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
and and the amounts vary sometimes at
 
05:47:14.390 --> 05:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's 800 sometimes it's 1,750 you know
 
05:47:16.548 --> 05:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
the the numbers range but there there's
 
05:47:18.390 --> 05:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
a pretty good sense of where we're at in
 
05:47:21.070 --> 05:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
terms of the batter's capacity whether
 
05:47:24.390 --> 05:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
it's 200 or less or 200 or more in terms
 
05:47:26.270 --> 05:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
of a cut off for where the larger amount
 
05:47:26.280 --> 05:47:27.708 align:start position:0%
of a cut off for where the larger amount
is

05:47:27.708 --> 05:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:47:27.718 --> 05:47:29.788 align:start position:0%
is
applied

05:47:29.788 --> 05:47:29.798 align:start position:0%
applied
 
05:47:32.830 --> 05:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGee has a
 
05:47:35.030 --> 05:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:47:37.990 --> 05:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um looking at
 
05:47:41.070 --> 05:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill again um it it
 
05:47:43.830 --> 05:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
gives the department of energy uh the
 
05:47:47.270 --> 05:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
requirement of developing and
 
05:47:49.990 --> 05:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
implementing a cash on the hood program
 
05:47:53.110 --> 05:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
but it does explicitly say point of sale
 
05:47:57.910 --> 05:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
right so it kind of indicates that that
 
05:48:00.868 --> 05:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
the dealers Car Sales folks will be
 
05:48:03.350 --> 05:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
involved in the in the in the program
 
05:48:05.788 --> 05:48:05.798 align:start position:0%
right they will just secure the funding
 
05:48:07.910 --> 05:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
from doe is
 
05:48:10.830 --> 05:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
that so when they make a sale they're
 
05:48:12.190 --> 05:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
going to get a cash rebate they have to
 
05:48:13.350 --> 05:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
go to the Department of energy to get
 
05:48:15.628 --> 05:48:15.638 align:start position:0%
that rebate I think that's the intention
 
05:48:17.868 --> 05:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
is that at the time the purchase is made
 
05:48:20.510 --> 05:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
with certain clawback Provisions right
 
05:48:22.628 --> 05:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
if someone Returns the car the deal is
 
05:48:24.670 --> 05:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
dead but at the time that the purchase
 
05:48:26.910 --> 05:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
is made we want people to be able to
 
05:48:29.788 --> 05:48:29.798 align:start position:0%
have those funds applied to the purchase
 
05:48:32.590 --> 05:48:32.600 align:start position:0%
so yes point of sale would mean that the
 
05:48:34.750 --> 05:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
dealership is involved in that that the
 
05:48:37.150 --> 05:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
funds are being directed to purchase the
 
05:48:39.750 --> 05:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
car point of sale rather than you get a
 
05:48:41.110 --> 05:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
check and you can end up buying a new
 
05:48:42.310 --> 05:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
fridge with it after you've already
 
05:48:44.150 --> 05:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
spent your own funds on a
 
05:48:48.510 --> 05:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
car so to clarify then that what that
 
05:48:52.110 --> 05:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
interaction looks like then to me is you
 
05:48:54.510 --> 05:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
go to buy the car the rebate exists the
 
05:48:56.708 --> 05:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
dealer applies the rebate lowers the
 
05:48:59.150 --> 05:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
cost of what you're buying and then gets
 
05:49:00.750 --> 05:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from the
 
05:49:06.468 --> 05:49:06.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:09.430 --> 05:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative Corman had a
 
05:49:11.948 --> 05:49:11.958 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:49:14.070 --> 05:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams for taking my
 
05:49:17.750 --> 05:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
question um so in a sense this
 
05:49:21.110 --> 05:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
represents uh shifting some some money
 
05:49:24.070 --> 05:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
from rate payers to people buying EVS
 
05:49:25.990 --> 05:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
what would be the effect on on a typical
 
05:49:26.000 --> 05:49:27.510 align:start position:0%
what would be the effect on on a typical
rate

05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
rate
 
05:49:27.520 --> 05:49:29.190 align:start position:0%
rate
payer

05:49:29.190 --> 05:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
payer
 
05:49:31.468 --> 05:49:31.478 align:start position:0%
so to be clear what we're doing with
 
05:49:34.510 --> 05:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
Reggie 33 million a year is TW taking
 
05:49:37.628 --> 05:49:37.638 align:start position:0%
29.5 of that and giving it back to rate
 
05:49:41.468 --> 05:49:41.478 align:start position:0%
payers um to help it's about 21 cents a
 
05:49:43.310 --> 05:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
month per household if you take the
 
05:49:45.788 --> 05:49:45.798 align:start position:0%
average electric cost so we're helping
 
05:49:49.030 --> 05:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
to defay their funds by 21 cents a month
 
05:49:50.350 --> 05:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
um that's with the
 
05:49:54.190 --> 05:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
29.5 uh million being returned if we
 
05:49:55.910 --> 05:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
reduce that to
 
05:49:58.948 --> 05:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
20 6.5 right I'm doing the math in my
 
05:50:01.430 --> 05:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
head 26.5 million instead of
 
05:50:04.350 --> 05:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
29.5 then um I'm I'm not going to do all
 
05:50:06.190 --> 05:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
the math out loud here with you but that
 
05:50:08.868 --> 05:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
would be the math is instead of 21 cents
 
05:50:14.948 --> 05:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:18.750 --> 05:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
month representative bernardy has a
 
05:50:22.990 --> 05:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
question thanks Mr chairman so uh since
 
05:50:25.390 --> 05:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
it's I think fairly well documented that
 
05:50:30.150 --> 05:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
most EV purchasers are weal ithier
 
05:50:34.990 --> 05:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
individuals you want to give a uh rebate
 
05:50:39.548 --> 05:50:39.558 align:start position:0%
to wealthier individuals and detract
 
05:50:42.468 --> 05:50:42.478 align:start position:0%
even if it's a minor amount from rate
 
05:50:45.830 --> 05:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
payers their their rebates H how do you
 
05:50:47.830 --> 05:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
square that
 
05:50:49.708 --> 05:50:49.718 align:start position:0%
Equity thank you for the question
 
05:50:52.270 --> 05:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi I would say that
 
05:50:53.590 --> 05:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about things that
 
05:50:55.430 --> 05:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
are technology on the bleeding edge
 
05:50:57.110 --> 05:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
often the people who are adopting are
 
05:50:58.628 --> 05:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
the wealthy because they can afford Bo
 
05:51:00.830 --> 05:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
to make mistakes on the bleeding edge I
 
05:51:02.510 --> 05:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
would pause it to you that we are past
 
05:51:04.070 --> 05:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
the bleeding edge right now and now
 
05:51:06.430 --> 05:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
we're getting closer to Cutting Edge uh
 
05:51:07.868 --> 05:51:07.878 align:start position:0%
where more and more people are entering
 
05:51:10.030 --> 05:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
the market not just the wealthy I know
 
05:51:12.030 --> 05:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
we see at the the tip when someone can
 
05:51:13.628 --> 05:51:13.638 align:start position:0%
afford to take a very large risk and
 
05:51:15.270 --> 05:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
lose that kind of money the adopters
 
05:51:17.670 --> 05:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
tend to be the far wealthier folks we're
 
05:51:19.708 --> 05:51:19.718 align:start position:0%
no longer there with EVS it's becoming
 
05:51:22.110 --> 05:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
much more mainstream um the example that
 
05:51:23.270 --> 05:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
I gave earlier when you have a
 
05:51:25.430 --> 05:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
16-year-old and it's their first car
 
05:51:27.190 --> 05:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
this is not really a wealthy person kind
 
05:51:28.948 --> 05:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
of thing to get a used for your
 
05:51:31.190 --> 05:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
16-year-old this is pretty typical
 
05:51:32.990 --> 05:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're looking for a somewhat junky car
 
05:51:34.990 --> 05:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
that your 16-year-old might get into an
 
05:51:37.070 --> 05:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
accident with uh but you want to make
 
05:51:38.350 --> 05:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
sure that you're buying something that's
 
05:51:40.708 --> 05:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
safe for your 16-year-old and also it's
 
05:51:43.150 --> 05:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
probably going to be fairly inexpensive
 
05:51:45.948 --> 05:51:45.958 align:start position:0%
still still could get a rebate because
 
05:51:47.788 --> 05:51:47.798 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point of the program
 
05:51:50.628 --> 05:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
also um as I mentioned the Connecticut
 
05:51:52.788 --> 05:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
program is subject to in income
 
05:51:54.948 --> 05:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
guidelines and though it doesn't say it
 
05:51:57.350 --> 05:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
in the bill if we are going to amend
 
05:51:59.150 --> 05:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
this to add some guard I think it makes
 
05:52:01.468 --> 05:52:01.478 align:start position:0%
sense to add income guidelines um so
 
05:52:04.190 --> 05:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
Connecticut has um for an individual or
 
05:52:08.788 --> 05:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
for a married couple uh tax amounts that
 
05:52:10.628 --> 05:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
people can be making that are acceptable
 
05:52:12.150 --> 05:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
to participate in the program or you
 
05:52:14.030 --> 05:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
just make too much you're not eligible
 
05:52:15.830 --> 05:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
and so I would say for this program I
 
05:52:17.310 --> 05:52:17.320 align:start position:0%
think that makes sense we're not looking
 
05:52:20.628 --> 05:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
to give money and take money from
 
05:52:22.070 --> 05:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
everyone and give it to the wealthy
 
05:52:23.230 --> 05:52:23.240 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're talking about
 
05:52:25.990 --> 05:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about an incentive to help
 
05:52:28.750 --> 05:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
push the market uh which would be based
 
05:52:32.430 --> 05:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
on Fair fairness for everyone
 
05:52:34.830 --> 05:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
involved representative licki has a
 
05:52:36.468 --> 05:52:36.478 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
05:52:38.468 --> 05:52:38.478 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh you
 
05:52:40.590 --> 05:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned the 200 mile range would that
 
05:52:42.910 --> 05:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
be name plate range and if it's a used
 
05:52:45.150 --> 05:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle would the range reflect for
 
05:52:46.990 --> 05:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
instance a 5-year-old battery in the
 
05:52:48.948 --> 05:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
winter with the Heat going and how would
 
05:52:51.750 --> 05:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
we determine these things uh thank you
 
05:52:53.350 --> 05:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
for the question representative lii I
 
05:52:55.430 --> 05:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
would say it's name plate um and I don't
 
05:52:58.788 --> 05:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
know about the the math to trct
 
05:53:00.510 --> 05:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
Performance Based on five years I can't
 
05:53:00.520 --> 05:53:03.590 align:start position:0%
Performance Based on five years I can't
answer

05:53:03.590 --> 05:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:06.628 --> 05:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
that representative rolds has a
 
05:53:09.110 --> 05:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
question just uh uh thank you Mr
 
05:53:10.708 --> 05:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
chairman though I just wanted to make
 
05:53:13.350 --> 05:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
maybe a clarification a clarification as
 
05:53:15.310 --> 05:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
as an EV owner I'm a little bit familiar
 
05:53:15.320 --> 05:53:16.190 align:start position:0%
as an EV owner I'm a little bit familiar
I

05:53:16.190 --> 05:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:53:19.430 --> 05:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
think if I may um representa MC Williams
 
05:53:22.030 --> 05:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
you you referred to the Connecticut
 
05:53:25.310 --> 05:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
program it's not the range of the
 
05:53:28.270 --> 05:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
battery it's the kilowatt hour capacity
 
05:53:31.150 --> 05:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
of the battery that is the defining U
 
05:53:32.990 --> 05:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
metric and that's not something that
 
05:53:37.350 --> 05:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
changes over time
 
05:53:40.150 --> 05:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
um it's like a size of a fuel
 
05:53:44.110 --> 05:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
tank um I I I'm sorry I can't speak in
 
05:53:46.948 --> 05:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
that specific uh I I I just don't know
 
05:53:49.390 --> 05:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
enough to answer that okay well I'm
 
05:53:50.590 --> 05:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
hoping to
 
05:53:52.788 --> 05:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
help okay additional questions
 
05:53:52.798 --> 05:53:53.948 align:start position:0%
help okay additional questions
representative

05:53:53.948 --> 05:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:53:56.230 --> 05:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you again and thank you
 
05:53:58.670 --> 05:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
again representative Williams so if this
 
05:54:01.350 --> 05:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
would apply to used EV sales then
 
05:54:03.628 --> 05:54:03.638 align:start position:0%
presumably that would would that be only
 
05:54:05.670 --> 05:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
for used EV sales that go through a
 
05:54:08.590 --> 05:54:08.600 align:start position:0%
dealer or if representative rolds wants
 
05:54:11.948 --> 05:54:11.958 align:start position:0%
to sell me his id4 then I get cash on
 
05:54:14.788 --> 05:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
the hood the intention here is with
 
05:54:17.390 --> 05:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
dealerships um once again and I
 
05:54:18.868 --> 05:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
apologize we haven't put a ton of
 
05:54:21.110 --> 05:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
guardrails in here but the intention
 
05:54:23.510 --> 05:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
here is we're trying to incentivize
 
05:54:25.948 --> 05:54:25.958 align:start position:0%
purchases through dealerships so I would
 
05:54:27.628 --> 05:54:27.638 align:start position:0%
say if you were to go on Craigslist and
 
05:54:29.708 --> 05:54:29.718 align:start position:0%
buy a used DV you would not be able to
 
05:54:31.270 --> 05:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
access these funds from Department of
 
05:54:33.350 --> 05:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
energy to try to get a
 
05:54:37.670 --> 05:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
discount followup and if I go to uh
 
05:54:41.030 --> 05:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
bills used car lot would it apply there
 
05:54:43.070 --> 05:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
if bills used car lot is a dealership in
 
05:54:48.190 --> 05:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:51.788 --> 05:54:51.798 align:start position:0%
there okay representative partiall has a
 
05:54:54.390 --> 05:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair Vos um having
 
05:54:57.030 --> 05:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
us gone to not bills used car lot but
 
05:54:58.590 --> 05:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
another car lot
 
05:55:00.468 --> 05:55:00.478 align:start position:0%
and being on a fixed income I was very
 
05:55:02.190 --> 05:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
grateful for the federal rebate but I
 
05:55:04.150 --> 05:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
think you're absolutely right cash on
 
05:55:06.030 --> 05:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
the hood is a big motivator for a lot of
 
05:55:07.948 --> 05:55:07.958 align:start position:0%
people that's not my question it's my
 
05:55:12.230 --> 05:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
comment um my question is more of a of a
 
05:55:15.150 --> 05:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
maybe an ideological one
 
05:55:17.548 --> 05:55:17.558 align:start position:0%
um having written a little bit of
 
05:55:19.708 --> 05:55:19.718 align:start position:0%
legislation myself at this point in my
 
05:55:22.990 --> 05:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
very brief career I sometimes feel like
 
05:55:26.230 --> 05:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
the enormity of a law that is obviously
 
05:55:29.468 --> 05:55:29.478 align:start position:0%
is ground uh game Chang changing is this
 
05:55:34.070 --> 05:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
is best left to a number of eyes and um
 
05:55:35.868 --> 05:55:35.878 align:start position:0%
within a work group within a work study
 
05:55:37.430 --> 05:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
group or something like that rather than
 
05:55:40.708 --> 05:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
try to uh imagine every scenario as the
 
05:55:43.670 --> 05:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
drafty sometimes is being asked to do
 
05:55:45.468 --> 05:55:45.478 align:start position:0%
could could you and would you imagine
 
05:55:47.628 --> 05:55:47.638 align:start position:0%
this going to a uh work group of somehow
 
05:55:50.990 --> 05:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:54.310 --> 05:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
guardrails um so I understand the way
 
05:55:55.990 --> 05:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
that this committee has been functioning
 
05:55:58.190 --> 05:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
during this house session is that we do
 
05:56:01.350 --> 05:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
have work session time set aside to work
 
05:56:03.310 --> 05:56:03.320 align:start position:0%
as a group and hash out details on a
 
05:56:05.468 --> 05:56:05.478 align:start position:0%
bill I would be happy to do that with
 
05:56:07.070 --> 05:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee if it's
 
05:56:12.390 --> 05:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:15.230 --> 05:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
to representative Noel has a question
 
05:56:17.070 --> 05:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
05:56:18.788 --> 05:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
question uh you had mentioned the
 
05:56:21.190 --> 05:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
Connecticut program is set up for six
 
05:56:22.788 --> 05:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
years where you were intending this
 
05:56:26.150 --> 05:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
program to follow that also uh thank you
 
05:56:28.030 --> 05:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
for the question I I put it in the text
 
05:56:29.990 --> 05:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
to the bill it's a two-year pilot so
 
05:56:35.708 --> 05:56:35.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:38.270 --> 05:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no other questions thank
 
05:56:40.190 --> 05:56:40.200 align:start position:0%

05:56:42.190 --> 05:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
legislation and now I'll call on thank

1472 as uh
 
05:57:42.548 --> 05:57:42.558 align:start position:0%
introduced um by way of background um
 
05:57:44.150 --> 05:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure folks on this committee are
 
05:57:46.708 --> 05:57:46.718 align:start position:0%
well aware of how Reggie functions but
 
05:57:48.190 --> 05:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh for those who don't uh the state
 
05:57:49.590 --> 05:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
currently participates in What's called
 
05:57:52.110 --> 05:57:52.120 align:start position:0%
the regional greenhouse gas initiative
 
05:57:54.548 --> 05:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
uh to cap and reduce CO2 emissions uh
 
05:57:57.110 --> 05:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
from the power sector um this initiative
 
05:57:59.868 --> 05:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
creates a market for emission allowances
 
05:58:01.708 --> 05:58:01.718 align:start position:0%
through a regional cap and trade program
 
05:58:04.430 --> 05:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
that other states take part in um New
 
05:58:05.868 --> 05:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire allowances are sold at
 
05:58:08.150 --> 05:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
quarterly auctions and the proceeds fund
 
05:58:10.990 --> 05:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
the state's Energy Efficiency fund uh
 
05:58:12.990 --> 05:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
this is a state dedicated fund uh
 
05:58:15.110 --> 05:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
created under State Statute to receive
 
05:58:18.070 --> 05:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
all of the allowance proceeds from uh
 
05:58:21.310 --> 05:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
Reggie under State Statute um all
 
05:58:24.190 --> 05:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
amounts in excess of the first dollar uh
 
05:58:26.708 --> 05:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
for every allowance are rebated back to
 
05:58:29.150 --> 05:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
retail Electric customers based on a per
 
05:58:31.788 --> 05:58:31.798 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour basis all remaining
 
05:58:33.788 --> 05:58:33.798 align:start position:0%
proceeds are allocated out as you'll see
 
05:58:35.910 --> 05:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
in my letter of testimony and all of
 
05:58:38.230 --> 05:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
that is required under State
 
05:58:40.788 --> 05:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
Statute this bill as introduced proposes
 
05:58:43.030 --> 05:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
to carve out $3 million from Reggie
 
05:58:45.708 --> 05:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
proceeds that are rebated back to re uh
 
05:58:47.948 --> 05:58:47.958 align:start position:0%
electric retail customers the department
 
05:58:49.468 --> 05:58:49.478 align:start position:0%
is then tasked with developing and
 
05:58:51.468 --> 05:58:51.478 align:start position:0%
implementing a cash on the hood program
 
05:58:54.788 --> 05:58:54.798 align:start position:0%
for point of sale EV rebates to buyers
 
05:58:57.150 --> 05:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
and the program shall be a 2-year pilot
 
05:58:57.160 --> 05:58:58.390 align:start position:0%
and the program shall be a 2-year pilot
program

05:58:58.390 --> 05:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:58:59.750 --> 05:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
um for a variety of reasons the
 
05:59:02.548 --> 05:59:02.558 align:start position:0%
department is opposed to this bill um
 
05:59:04.510 --> 05:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
the first uh is that it would result in
 
05:59:08.070 --> 05:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
a loss of a $3 million um rebate amount
 
05:59:10.468 --> 05:59:10.478 align:start position:0%
to Electric rate payers again as I
 
05:59:12.270 --> 05:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned under current law all amounts
 
05:59:15.468 --> 05:59:15.478 align:start position:0%
in excess of that $1 um threshold are
 
05:59:17.788 --> 05:59:17.798 align:start position:0%
rebate back to Electric customers the
 
05:59:20.670 --> 05:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
loss of $3 million in rebates would
 
05:59:22.910 --> 05:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
would lead to a $3 million increase in
 
05:59:25.310 --> 05:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
electricity cost to Electric customers
 
05:59:26.750 --> 05:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
and this would come at a time when New
 
05:59:27.948 --> 05:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's electric rate rates are
 
05:59:29.910 --> 05:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
decreasing given the massive price
 
05:59:33.548 --> 05:59:33.558 align:start position:0%
spikes that we saw during 2022 to
 
05:59:36.788 --> 05:59:36.798 align:start position:0%
2023 uh secondly uh as noted in the
 
05:59:38.868 --> 05:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um the bill does not
 
05:59:40.990 --> 05:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
authorize any new positions nor does it
 
05:59:42.788 --> 05:59:42.798 align:start position:0%
provide any funding to cover any
 
05:59:44.990 --> 05:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
estimated internal expenditures needed
 
05:59:46.590 --> 05:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
by the department to implement this
 
05:59:48.708 --> 05:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
program um the department does not
 
05:59:49.990 --> 05:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
currently have the administrative
 
05:59:52.190 --> 05:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
resources to oversee this this rebate
 
05:59:54.548 --> 05:59:54.558 align:start position:0%
program especially a point of sale
 
05:59:56.670 --> 05:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
rebate program that requires a lot of
 
05:59:58.990 --> 05:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
moving parts for rebates to be available
 
06:00:01.310 --> 06:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
at the point of
 
06:00:03.628 --> 06:00:03.638 align:start position:0%
sale additionally there is a lack of
 
06:00:05.548 --> 06:00:05.558 align:start position:0%
clarity on the program's start and
 
06:00:08.070 --> 06:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
sunset um I do understand based on uh
 
06:00:09.510 --> 06:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony as well as the
 
06:00:11.750 --> 06:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill that the Bill calls for an initial
 
06:00:14.910 --> 06:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
two-year pilot rebate program but uh
 
06:00:17.910 --> 06:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
there is no fixed Program start date
 
06:00:20.430 --> 06:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
assuming the program you know began July
 
06:00:23.590 --> 06:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
1 of this year the department would not
 
06:00:25.750 --> 06:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
be in any position to start that rebate
 
06:00:27.708 --> 06:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
program without adequate administr
 
06:00:30.708 --> 06:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
resources there is also no Sunset to the
 
06:00:32.310 --> 06:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism while the bill
 
06:00:34.548 --> 06:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
indicates the program runs for two years
 
06:00:37.030 --> 06:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
time the funding keeps coming to US
 
06:00:39.990 --> 06:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
every year um so following that two-year
 
06:00:42.350 --> 06:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
period under this bill the department
 
06:00:44.350 --> 06:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate 3 million after
 
06:00:46.190 --> 06:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
that two-year period every year to
 
06:00:48.030 --> 06:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
implement a program that we have no
 
06:00:51.070 --> 06:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
authority to implement any longer um as
 
06:00:52.830 --> 06:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned the department also
 
06:00:55.350 --> 06:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
has uh concerns with the lack of any
 
06:00:57.990 --> 06:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
direction on program design such
 
06:00:59.310 --> 06:00:59.320 align:start position:0%
examples were mentioned earlier in
 
06:01:01.030 --> 06:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
previous testimony but it would also
 
06:01:02.910 --> 06:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
include what the amount is re uh the
 
06:01:05.110 --> 06:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
amount the rebate is set for whether
 
06:01:07.788 --> 06:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
it's means tested who is eligible should
 
06:01:09.628 --> 06:01:09.638 align:start position:0%
there be a differentiation between new
 
06:01:13.510 --> 06:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
and used EVS um one could potentially be
 
06:01:15.230 --> 06:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
giving a rebate to somebody a
 
06:01:16.910 --> 06:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts resident who comes up here
 
06:01:20.150 --> 06:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire to buy an EV car the
 
06:01:22.628 --> 06:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
bill does not give the department any
 
06:01:25.070 --> 06:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
authority to enforce any program design
 
06:01:26.708 --> 06:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
decisions without clear legislative
 
06:01:28.830 --> 06:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
Authority for example the department
 
06:01:31.150 --> 06:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
could offer a $55,000 rebate to a
 
06:01:33.190 --> 06:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
consumer and in theory the department
 
06:01:34.628 --> 06:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
could receive a legal Challenge from
 
06:01:37.030 --> 06:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
somebody wanting a larger rebate amount
 
06:01:39.230 --> 06:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
without any statutory or administrative
 
06:01:41.788 --> 06:01:41.798 align:start position:0%
rule as a legal basis any and every
 
06:01:44.430 --> 06:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
program design could be challenged by
 
06:01:46.868 --> 06:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
anybody and then finally I did want to
 
06:01:48.868 --> 06:01:48.878 align:start position:0%
note that there are existing Federal
 
06:01:50.750 --> 06:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
incentives uh through the inflation
 
06:01:53.868 --> 06:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
reduction act for the purchase of EVS um
 
06:01:57.070 --> 06:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
there is up to a uh $7,500 federal tax
 
06:01:57.080 --> 06:01:57.948 align:start position:0%
there is up to a uh $7,500 federal tax
credit

06:01:57.948 --> 06:01:57.958 align:start position:0%
credit
 
06:02:00.390 --> 06:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh available to buyers for a new uh
 
06:02:03.190 --> 06:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
qualifying EV and another tax credit of
 
06:02:07.110 --> 06:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
up to 4,500 for existing or pre-owned
 
06:02:11.430 --> 06:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
EVS um given the uh number of concerns
 
06:02:13.948 --> 06:02:13.958 align:start position:0%
the department has with this bill um we
 
06:02:15.510 --> 06:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
did want to note that there are several
 
06:02:17.990 --> 06:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
ongoing or proposed study committees
 
06:02:19.990 --> 06:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
looking at EV deployment here in the
 
06:02:22.030 --> 06:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
state um this committee might want to
 
06:02:24.070 --> 06:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
consider bringing this bill forward in
 
06:02:26.830 --> 06:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
those forms to discuss it um examples
 
06:02:27.750 --> 06:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
include the new New Hampshire
 
06:02:29.230 --> 06:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation Council which has been
 
06:02:31.468 --> 06:02:31.478 align:start position:0%
around for a number of years um last
 
06:02:32.788 --> 06:02:32.798 align:start position:0%
year there was the committee to study
 
06:02:34.990 --> 06:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
funding mechanisms for EV charging
 
06:02:37.070 --> 06:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that bill was signed into
 
06:02:40.510 --> 06:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
law in August and as far as I checked
 
06:02:42.510 --> 06:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
this morning the committee has not met
 
06:02:44.390 --> 06:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
yet and then finally I believe that
 
06:02:46.548 --> 06:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
there's somebody in this room who has a
 
06:02:49.110 --> 06:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
bill that would propose a study a study
 
06:02:51.990 --> 06:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
commission looking at barriers um on EV
 
06:02:54.270 --> 06:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
use and sales um that bill is pending in
 
06:02:55.788 --> 06:02:55.798 align:start position:0%
another Committee in the house Public
 
06:02:57.590 --> 06:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
Works and highways committee and that
 
06:02:59.708 --> 06:02:59.718 align:start position:0%
might be another form to maybe discuss
 
06:03:02.990 --> 06:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh changes like this um with that I'll
 
06:03:06.230 --> 06:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
close my testimony and thank you very
 
06:03:10.670 --> 06:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
much thank you so it sounds like you're
 
06:03:13.150 --> 06:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
pointing out that this bill offers no
 
06:03:17.628 --> 06:03:17.638 align:start position:0%
sunset sunset for the uh $3 million
 
06:03:19.510 --> 06:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
Appropriations just wiped out the
 
06:03:21.948 --> 06:03:21.958 align:start position:0%
department of Energy's annual Aruba
 
06:03:21.958 --> 06:03:23.750 align:start position:0%
department of Energy's annual Aruba
vacation

06:03:23.750 --> 06:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
vacation
 
06:03:26.788 --> 06:03:26.798 align:start position:0%
fund um I didn't hear a question in
 
06:03:28.750 --> 06:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
there I heard a statement
 
06:03:32.230 --> 06:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
so um but there was no question but just
 
06:03:33.788 --> 06:03:33.798 align:start position:0%
I guess to respond to that at least a
 
06:03:36.670 --> 06:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
little bit is that yes as I uh mentioned
 
06:03:38.590 --> 06:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
in uh number three in our letter of
 
06:03:41.270 --> 06:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
testimony is that the bill does indicate
 
06:03:43.548 --> 06:03:43.558 align:start position:0%
that the program would run as a pilot
 
06:03:46.110 --> 06:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
for two years however there's no repeal
 
06:03:48.110 --> 06:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
of that provision after two years no
 
06:03:50.868 --> 06:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
explicit Sunset so while we have the
 
06:03:53.150 --> 06:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to implement this
 
06:03:56.110 --> 06:03:56.120 align:start position:0%
this program that 2 million every year
 
06:03:58.590 --> 06:03:58.600 align:start position:0%
will continue coming to after the 2-year
 
06:04:01.430 --> 06:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
window has closed because again that
 
06:04:02.910 --> 06:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
that language is not being removed in
 
06:04:04.390 --> 06:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
any way shape or
 
06:04:07.830 --> 06:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
form questions for Mr Roberge
 
06:04:10.670 --> 06:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative muns has one thank you Mr
 
06:04:15.590 --> 06:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
chair Mr Roberge welcome back um so I
 
06:04:17.548 --> 06:04:17.558 align:start position:0%
understand that the the Reggie money
 
06:04:21.670 --> 06:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
would kind of that Doe has oversight for
 
06:04:25.070 --> 06:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
that but is doe the right Department to
 
06:04:27.150 --> 06:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
administer something like this should it
 
06:04:28.590 --> 06:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
should it be like the Department of
 
06:04:30.670 --> 06:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration I mean you know
 
06:04:35.910 --> 06:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
they they deal with handing out money
 
06:04:38.948 --> 06:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
regularly I I'm I'm just asking sure
 
06:04:40.910 --> 06:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question you
 
06:04:43.788 --> 06:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
know I guess I would say and I'm trying
 
06:04:45.468 --> 06:04:45.478 align:start position:0%
to be careful because there is somebody
 
06:04:47.830 --> 06:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
behind me from another state agency but
 
06:04:50.270 --> 06:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
um you know when it comes to State EV
 
06:04:52.788 --> 06:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
policy typically the two lead agencies
 
06:04:54.230 --> 06:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
tend to be the New Hampshire Department
 
06:04:56.350 --> 06:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
of Transportation and the Department of
 
06:04:58.548 --> 06:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
Environmental servic here in the state
 
06:05:01.310 --> 06:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
um the department of
 
06:05:04.110 --> 06:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
energy doesn't drive EV policy in the
 
06:05:07.510 --> 06:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
state no pun intended but um that might
 
06:05:09.390 --> 06:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
be something that this this committee
 
06:05:12.788 --> 06:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
might want to consider but if this bill
 
06:05:14.350 --> 06:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
as the bill is drafted right now it
 
06:05:16.390 --> 06:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
would be housed with us we are obviously
 
06:05:17.910 --> 06:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
outlining concerns with the current
 
06:05:20.230 --> 06:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
language as it's written followup
 
06:05:23.190 --> 06:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
followup um no I I I don't disagree that
 
06:05:26.070 --> 06:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
from a policy point of view the doe and
 
06:05:28.110 --> 06:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
your counterparts sitting in the back is
 
06:05:30.310 --> 06:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
probably the the right agencies I'm I
 
06:05:32.190 --> 06:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
guess I'm thinking more about the me the
 
06:05:34.110 --> 06:05:34.120 align:start position:0%
the the administration of the the
 
06:05:34.120 --> 06:05:35.430 align:start position:0%
the the administration of the the
mechanics

06:05:35.430 --> 06:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
mechanics
 
06:05:38.830 --> 06:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
of allocating money state money or
 
06:05:42.030 --> 06:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
sending State money to car dealerships
 
06:05:44.830 --> 06:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
um you know reviewing those applications
 
06:05:44.840 --> 06:05:45.670 align:start position:0%
um you know reviewing those applications
I

06:05:45.670 --> 06:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:05:48.350 --> 06:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
mean that to me it doesn't sound like
 
06:05:51.110 --> 06:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's something that's part of Doe's
 
06:05:53.190 --> 06:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure whereas somebody like the
 
06:05:54.670 --> 06:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
06:05:57.230 --> 06:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
they might have the Manpower already to
 
06:05:59.190 --> 06:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
handle that and it wouldn't be a major
 
06:06:02.030 --> 06:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
burden for them yeah sure uh I guess I
 
06:06:03.990 --> 06:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
would say potentially you'd have to ask
 
06:06:06.150 --> 06:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
the Dr about their infrastructure
 
06:06:08.190 --> 06:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
respectfully thank
 
06:06:11.030 --> 06:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Kaplan has a question
 
06:06:12.468 --> 06:06:12.478 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
06:06:15.070 --> 06:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
Rober thank you um you know you in your
 
06:06:16.548 --> 06:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
in your testimony you say you're opposed
 
06:06:18.190 --> 06:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
to the bill for Technical and policy
 
06:06:20.430 --> 06:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
reasons and you know I can understand
 
06:06:22.430 --> 06:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
some of the technical reasons or
 
06:06:23.910 --> 06:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat I can understand the technical
 
06:06:25.830 --> 06:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
reasons maybe the the Staffing is an
 
06:06:28.270 --> 06:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
issue and although I always feel that
 
06:06:30.350 --> 06:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
you know that if Staffing is an issue
 
06:06:32.510 --> 06:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
you can you go out and hire somebody and
 
06:06:33.830 --> 06:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
and and that should be in the fiscal
 
06:06:36.350 --> 06:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
note but um but I need some
 
06:06:37.868 --> 06:06:37.878 align:start position:0%
clarification from you on the policy
 
06:06:40.430 --> 06:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
issues and I'm assuming that the policy
 
06:06:43.948 --> 06:06:43.958 align:start position:0%
uh opposition is in the in the in the in
 
06:06:46.030 --> 06:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
the question of the rebate going back or
 
06:06:48.070 --> 06:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
being not going back to the to the rate
 
06:06:51.150 --> 06:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
payers so and and in your testimony you
 
06:06:53.110 --> 06:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
say this comes at a time when when rates
 
06:06:55.310 --> 06:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
are actually decreasing so what is the
 
06:06:57.190 --> 06:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
the can you be more clear about what the
 
06:06:59.070 --> 06:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
policy opposition are you just simply
 
06:07:02.230 --> 06:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to any change in the uh
 
06:07:05.350 --> 06:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
structure of the Reggie no and thank you
 
06:07:07.590 --> 06:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
for the question so I guess our policy
 
06:07:10.590 --> 06:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
concern was that new electric rates have
 
06:07:13.150 --> 06:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
been high due to the Ukrainian crisis
 
06:07:15.310 --> 06:07:15.320 align:start position:0%
inflationary price spikes in recent
 
06:07:17.868 --> 06:07:17.878 align:start position:0%
years and now rate payers are starting
 
06:07:19.708 --> 06:07:19.718 align:start position:0%
to see some relief as rates are starting
 
06:07:22.390 --> 06:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
to stabilize and decrease we have
 
06:07:24.910 --> 06:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
concern with passing a $3 million
 
06:07:26.948 --> 06:07:26.958 align:start position:0%
increase to Electric rate payers at this
 
06:07:30.628 --> 06:07:30.638 align:start position:0%
this time given that rate pairs have had
 
06:07:31.670 --> 06:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
a very
 
06:07:34.270 --> 06:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
sizable rate increase for some years
 
06:07:35.788 --> 06:07:35.798 align:start position:0%
they're starting to get some relief we
 
06:07:37.230 --> 06:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
don't think we should be increasing
 
06:07:38.468 --> 06:07:38.478 align:start position:0%
their time at a time when rates are
 
06:07:40.670 --> 06:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
starting to go
 
06:07:44.110 --> 06:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
down followup okay but that that seems
 
06:07:46.628 --> 06:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
like sort of a random line of thought I
 
06:07:49.270 --> 06:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
mean at what point Is it feasible for
 
06:07:52.190 --> 06:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
for that money to uh you know be be uh
 
06:07:53.948 --> 06:07:53.958 align:start position:0%
targeted to another use as opposed to
 
06:07:55.910 --> 06:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
just being returned to the raid pairs is
 
06:07:57.468 --> 06:07:57.478 align:start position:0%
there is there ever a Time like would it
 
06:07:59.510 --> 06:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
take a 10-year dip in prices or a
 
06:08:02.590 --> 06:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
10-month dip in prices yep what is the
 
06:08:04.270 --> 06:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
cut off sure then thank you for the
 
06:08:05.628 --> 06:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
question so that I guess I'd kick it
 
06:08:06.948 --> 06:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
back to the committee is that that is
 
06:08:09.190 --> 06:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
something the legislature you know has
 
06:08:11.390 --> 06:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over as to whether or not
 
06:08:13.948 --> 06:08:13.958 align:start position:0%
um or how these rebate do I'm sorry
 
06:08:16.548 --> 06:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
these Reggie proceeds are used obviously
 
06:08:18.628 --> 06:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
under State Statute everything in excess
 
06:08:20.628 --> 06:08:20.638 align:start position:0%
of the $1 rebate threshold is rebate
 
06:08:21.910 --> 06:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
back to customers that is what the
 
06:08:23.590 --> 06:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
legislature in the past has deemed
 
06:08:26.788 --> 06:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate um and a certain portion is
 
06:08:28.510 --> 06:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
is allocated into existing Energy
 
06:08:31.230 --> 06:08:31.240 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs um I cannot speak
 
06:08:33.110 --> 06:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
what the future will look like or any
 
06:08:35.070 --> 06:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
qualifiers you know this committee makes
 
06:08:36.310 --> 06:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
the determination as to how those
 
06:08:38.350 --> 06:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
dollars are used we would just
 
06:08:40.350 --> 06:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
respectfully feel that after a time of
 
06:08:42.750 --> 06:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
significant rate increases and energy
 
06:08:46.110 --> 06:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
cost spikes that we should not be moving
 
06:08:48.390 --> 06:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
back in that direction if if we can
 
06:08:49.868 --> 06:08:49.878 align:start position:0%
control the policy to do that we should
 
06:08:49.878 --> 06:08:51.510 align:start position:0%
control the policy to do that we should
avoid

06:08:51.510 --> 06:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
06:08:54.468 --> 06:08:54.478 align:start position:0%
it representative McGee has a question
 
06:08:56.070 --> 06:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
06:08:58.468 --> 06:08:58.478 align:start position:0%
Ro for my question it's kind of a follow
 
06:09:00.190 --> 06:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
on in that same vein because it really
 
06:09:03.468 --> 06:09:03.478 align:start position:0%
does come down to the money and how much
 
06:09:08.190 --> 06:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
of an impact it has and um I I think um
 
06:09:10.670 --> 06:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
we've gone back and forth for a while in
 
06:09:11.868 --> 06:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should be trying to
 
06:09:13.990 --> 06:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
make more impactful use of that money
 
06:09:16.708 --> 06:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
rather than pennies per Bill do you have
 
06:09:18.390 --> 06:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
any calculations on that because I know
 
06:09:20.430 --> 06:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
in the past you've testified with what
 
06:09:23.628 --> 06:09:23.638 align:start position:0%
you think the $3 million I believe it
 
06:09:25.628 --> 06:09:25.638 align:start position:0%
was representative McWilliams testimony
 
06:09:28.628 --> 06:09:28.638 align:start position:0%
that was about about 21 cents per month
 
06:09:31.390 --> 06:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
per Bill and how many rate payers do we
 
06:09:32.750 --> 06:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
have in New Hampshire so we can actually
 
06:09:35.310 --> 06:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
do the math if we want to sure and thank
 
06:09:37.150 --> 06:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
you for the question I households or
 
06:09:39.590 --> 06:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
whatever sure um so I think
 
06:09:41.190 --> 06:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
representative Mick Williams had used
 
06:09:44.230 --> 06:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
2021 data uh before coming here today I
 
06:09:48.628 --> 06:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
had tried to pull up some 2022 data
 
06:09:51.310 --> 06:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
so it might be easier to send in an
 
06:09:54.590 --> 06:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
email but um to try to keep it fairly
 
06:09:56.390 --> 06:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
high level without getting too far deep
 
06:09:59.708 --> 06:09:59.718 align:start position:0%
into to the math assuming a residential
 
06:10:03.548 --> 06:10:03.558 align:start position:0%
uh rate payer using 650 kilowatt hours
 
06:10:04.548 --> 06:10:04.558 align:start position:0%
um in
 
06:10:08.030 --> 06:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
2022 they were re back
 
06:10:10.708 --> 06:10:10.718 align:start position:0%
$28.98 roughly and that's again assuming
 
06:10:10.718 --> 06:10:11.670 align:start position:0%
$28.98 roughly and that's again assuming
a

06:10:11.670 --> 06:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:10:16.030 --> 06:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
650 uh per year that's correct um yes
 
06:10:18.070 --> 06:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I have here and I
 
06:10:20.070 --> 06:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
would just remind the committee last
 
06:10:22.110 --> 06:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
year I messed up Reggie numbers
 
06:10:24.830 --> 06:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
spectacularly during one of my testimony
 
06:10:26.990 --> 06:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
I that's at least what I have here today
 
06:10:28.190 --> 06:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
if we're going to go deeper into the
 
06:10:29.830 --> 06:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
math I'm going to say I'm going to come
 
06:10:32.708 --> 06:10:32.718 align:start position:0%
back to you please and follow up
 
06:10:36.070 --> 06:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
sure so the followup to that would be um
 
06:10:40.590 --> 06:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
I I am not aware of anyone who who
 
06:10:43.070 --> 06:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
understood when their bills shot up that
 
06:10:44.590 --> 06:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
they were getting a Reggie rebate in
 
06:10:46.788 --> 06:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
other words I don't think the rebate is
 
06:10:48.510 --> 06:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
large enough that anybody really you
 
06:10:50.708 --> 06:10:50.718 align:start position:0%
know knows and we're not talking about
 
06:10:52.548 --> 06:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
removing the entire rebate right this
 
06:10:55.430 --> 06:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
this program is just a small portion so
 
06:10:57.390 --> 06:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to qu sort of clarify
 
06:10:58.670 --> 06:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
that on the record because you brought
 
06:11:00.868 --> 06:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
it up as a one of the reasons for the
 
06:11:03.110 --> 06:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
opposition from the doe and as you said
 
06:11:05.150 --> 06:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's up to the legislature to determine
 
06:11:08.788 --> 06:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
how the money is used and if it changes
 
06:11:11.430 --> 06:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
how it changes so yeah no that's correct
 
06:11:12.948 --> 06:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
okay thanks thank
 
06:11:15.910 --> 06:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
you representative parshall has a
 
06:11:18.110 --> 06:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair V and thank you
 
06:11:21.350 --> 06:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
for being here today thank you um one of
 
06:11:23.830 --> 06:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
the things you mentioned was a stability
 
06:11:25.788 --> 06:11:25.798 align:start position:0%
and when I'm seeing this program I'm
 
06:11:25.798 --> 06:11:28.110 align:start position:0%
and when I'm seeing this program I'm
seeing

06:11:28.110 --> 06:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
06:11:30.868 --> 06:11:30.878 align:start position:0%
one of the concepts that's addressed is
 
06:11:34.510 --> 06:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
battery storage on a local level could
 
06:11:36.590 --> 06:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
reduce our time of
 
06:11:40.548 --> 06:11:40.558 align:start position:0%
day uh Reliance upon uh well basically
 
06:11:42.948 --> 06:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
flatten our curve yes our you know and
 
06:11:44.590 --> 06:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
and to me that's a very big thing if we
 
06:11:47.708 --> 06:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
can reduce that Peak predictably we can
 
06:11:51.110 --> 06:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
reduce rates and um I hopefully they
 
06:11:54.510 --> 06:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
would reduce rates and so I see this as
 
06:11:56.990 --> 06:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
a move towards that using Regional
 
06:11:59.788 --> 06:11:59.798 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas initiative funds for
 
06:12:01.548 --> 06:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
something that really actually does
 
06:12:04.468 --> 06:12:04.478 align:start position:0%
reduce greenhouse gas and also reduce
 
06:12:08.070 --> 06:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
reduces rates and provides stability I
 
06:12:10.070 --> 06:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's how I see it I I I don't mean to
 
06:12:12.070 --> 06:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
make it a debate on this but could you
 
06:12:15.990 --> 06:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
please uh maybe tell me where my
 
06:12:18.430 --> 06:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
thinking is not accurate on this I'd be
 
06:12:20.310 --> 06:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
welcome to hear it sure no uh thank you
 
06:12:23.430 --> 06:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
for the question so um yes battery
 
06:12:25.868 --> 06:12:25.878 align:start position:0%
storage does have the potential to I
 
06:12:28.548 --> 06:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
guess put power back onto the Grid at
 
06:12:30.110 --> 06:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
times when it's certainly most needed to
 
06:12:31.910 --> 06:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
reduce as you mentioned those Peaks and
 
06:12:35.030 --> 06:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
Val uh Peaks I guess I would say um the
 
06:12:37.230 --> 06:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
other thing I would note is that um we
 
06:12:40.150 --> 06:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
do uh the department has been working um
 
06:12:41.868 --> 06:12:41.878 align:start position:0%
on a bill in the Senate that would
 
06:12:44.270 --> 06:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
modify an ex that would a little bit
 
06:12:46.070 --> 06:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
modify an existing battery storage
 
06:12:47.310 --> 06:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
investigation that we have
 
06:12:49.548 --> 06:12:49.558 align:start position:0%
responsibility over which I'm sure um
 
06:12:51.110 --> 06:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
this committee May likely see if the
 
06:12:53.670 --> 06:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
Senate passes that bill um so i' would
 
06:12:56.070 --> 06:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
say we're certainly aware of of the
 
06:13:01.190 --> 06:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
benefit that battery storage may have
 
06:13:04.990 --> 06:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
yep so as a followup to that
 
06:13:07.910 --> 06:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
question wouldn't it make sense to do a
 
06:13:11.070 --> 06:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
pilot program on using EV battery
 
06:13:11.080 --> 06:13:12.868 align:start position:0%
pilot program on using EV battery
storage

06:13:12.868 --> 06:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
storage
 
06:13:16.708 --> 06:13:16.718 align:start position:0%
to augment the grid
 
06:13:20.868 --> 06:13:20.878 align:start position:0%
before doing a pilot program on taking
 
06:13:24.670 --> 06:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
money to use taking money and use it for
 
06:13:26.910 --> 06:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
cash on the hood
 
06:13:28.910 --> 06:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
car buying pilot
 
06:13:32.510 --> 06:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
program because even though that's
 
06:13:34.708 --> 06:13:34.718 align:start position:0%
touted as one of the possible advantages
 
06:13:37.230 --> 06:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
of more EVS we don't know if that's
 
06:13:38.708 --> 06:13:38.718 align:start position:0%
actually going to work yet nobody's
 
06:13:41.310 --> 06:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
tried that yet isn't that correct yes uh
 
06:13:42.510 --> 06:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so that is
 
06:13:44.708 --> 06:13:44.718 align:start position:0%
correct and obviously it you know
 
06:13:47.110 --> 06:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not this legislature wants to
 
06:13:48.910 --> 06:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
require a pilot to look into
 
06:13:50.548 --> 06:13:50.558 align:start position:0%
specifically EV batteries and their
 
06:13:51.830 --> 06:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
benefits that's certainly something
 
06:13:55.150 --> 06:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
within its purview um that is maybe one
 
06:13:56.868 --> 06:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
of the reasons I had suggested the three
 
06:13:58.788 --> 06:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
different forms at the tail end of my
 
06:14:00.230 --> 06:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
letter is that you know there's
 
06:14:03.270 --> 06:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
certainly pros and cons to this approach
 
06:14:06.030 --> 06:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
probably best to discuss it with um a
 
06:14:07.628 --> 06:14:07.638 align:start position:0%
more inclusive set of stakeholders in
 
06:14:09.030 --> 06:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
the Forum that's been established for
 
06:14:11.948 --> 06:14:11.958 align:start position:0%
some time um you know get all parties in
 
06:14:13.788 --> 06:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
the room to kind of see if there's a a
 
06:14:13.798 --> 06:14:16.350 align:start position:0%
the room to kind of see if there's a a
path

06:14:16.350 --> 06:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:19.430 --> 06:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
forward additional
 
06:14:21.788 --> 06:14:21.798 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Mr
 
06:14:24.110 --> 06:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
robers I have no other pink
 
06:14:26.390 --> 06:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
cards that uh from people who want want
 
06:14:28.990 --> 06:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
to testify although Michael Fitzgerald
 
06:14:31.390 --> 06:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
from the Department of New Hampshire uh
 
06:14:34.390 --> 06:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services is here to answer
 
06:14:36.708 --> 06:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
questions if anybody on the committee
 
06:14:39.548 --> 06:14:39.558 align:start position:0%
has a question regarding this
 
06:14:42.548 --> 06:14:42.558 align:start position:0%
legislation does anyone have
 
06:14:47.070 --> 06:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
any apparently so so Mr fitzg you're
 
06:14:49.548 --> 06:14:49.558 align:start position:0%
up can't let you leave the room unac
 
06:14:51.510 --> 06:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
costed every time Michael and
 
06:14:53.270 --> 06:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative McGee gets the first
 
06:14:56.390 --> 06:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
question ah thank you Mr chair m
 
06:14:59.270 --> 06:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
question has to do with um I know you're
 
06:15:02.110 --> 06:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
embroiled in planning around the climate
 
06:15:03.628 --> 06:15:03.638 align:start position:0%
action plan that needs to be submitted
 
06:15:07.390 --> 06:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
by next march and I'm just wondering
 
06:15:10.548 --> 06:15:10.558 align:start position:0%
whether a program like this in any way
 
06:15:14.510 --> 06:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
would fold into the types of
 
06:15:16.830 --> 06:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
um types of pieces of the plan that
 
06:15:18.948 --> 06:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
you're looking at at this point I'm just
 
06:15:21.350 --> 06:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot in the works that
 
06:15:23.670 --> 06:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
maybe will dovetail with the work that
 
06:15:25.430 --> 06:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
you're doing so I just was wondering if
 
06:15:27.990 --> 06:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
if we could know that so thank you
 
06:15:30.110 --> 06:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's a very timely question um
 
06:15:33.030 --> 06:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the the uh you're you're
 
06:15:36.590 --> 06:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
just a hair hair ahead of the timing um
 
06:15:39.190 --> 06:15:39.200 align:start position:0%
by February 1st we have to submit a
 
06:15:41.430 --> 06:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
notice of intent to the federal
 
06:15:44.150 --> 06:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
government on whether we plan to apply
 
06:15:49.110 --> 06:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
for um cprg $4.6 billion in cprg funding
 
06:15:52.070 --> 06:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
that is uh uh become that will become
 
06:15:55.390 --> 06:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
available in April and we're in the
 
06:15:58.510 --> 06:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
process right now of doing Outreach
 
06:16:01.830 --> 06:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
sessions and collecting information from
 
06:16:03.868 --> 06:16:03.878 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire from
 
06:16:06.350 --> 06:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
organizations uh you know from a wide
 
06:16:10.350 --> 06:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
variety of stakeholders to to inform uh
 
06:16:12.910 --> 06:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
our what's known as a peap priority
 
06:16:15.350 --> 06:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
climate action plan um that that is
 
06:16:17.910 --> 06:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
required as of March 1st so those
 
06:16:21.510 --> 06:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
decisions are coming up very shortly and
 
06:16:25.230 --> 06:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
um but we have we this is certainly
 
06:16:27.270 --> 06:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
consistent with a lot of the information
 
06:16:30.868 --> 06:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
that we are um receiving for support of
 
06:16:34.868 --> 06:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
EVS uh and transitioning to to um EV
 
06:16:38.190 --> 06:16:38.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Etc um but um we haven't
 
06:16:40.190 --> 06:16:40.200 align:start position:0%
made any ultimate decisions at this
 
06:16:43.670 --> 06:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
point can I have a followup
 
06:16:46.708 --> 06:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
well Mr Fitzgerald volunteered to come
 
06:16:49.030 --> 06:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
here to speak to us if we had questions
 
06:16:51.590 --> 06:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
about this bill M and now you're asking
 
06:16:52.750 --> 06:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
questions that have nothing to do with
 
06:16:55.350 --> 06:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
the bill so well can you ask a question
 
06:16:59.708 --> 06:16:59.718 align:start position:0%
about the bill s yes okay um yes I I I
 
06:17:01.708 --> 06:17:01.718 align:start position:0%
see them as related so that's just my
 
06:17:05.430 --> 06:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
brain but um so my question is whether
 
06:17:07.468 --> 06:17:07.478 align:start position:0%
or not it is helpful to have a bill like
 
06:17:10.190 --> 06:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
this in order to
 
06:17:14.310 --> 06:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
um point to uh as far as something going
 
06:17:17.030 --> 06:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
on in the state that you're going to be
 
06:17:18.510 --> 06:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
reporting as part of the plan I me
 
06:17:19.670 --> 06:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to figure out is
 
06:17:21.270 --> 06:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
is there a connection
 
06:17:23.030 --> 06:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
between this
 
06:17:25.670 --> 06:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
bill uh I would I would say at this
 
06:17:28.868 --> 06:17:28.878 align:start position:0%
point um this wouldn't necessarily have
 
06:17:31.510 --> 06:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
an impact it certainly wouldn't hurt um
 
06:17:32.948 --> 06:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
but it would not necessarily have an
 
06:17:36.750 --> 06:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
impact on our our plans for the pcap uh
 
06:17:41.150 --> 06:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
and again we have limited guidance from
 
06:17:43.670 --> 06:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
the feds as to how that 4.6 billion is
 
06:17:45.628 --> 06:17:45.638 align:start position:0%
going to be allocated at this point in
 
06:17:49.590 --> 06:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
time uh and so um again this is
 
06:17:53.468 --> 06:17:53.478 align:start position:0%
certainly somewhat consistent but um I I
 
06:17:57.230 --> 06:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
I don't think it would sway any any
 
06:18:01.750 --> 06:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
decisions uh in in this arena for US
 
06:18:04.548 --> 06:18:04.558 align:start position:0%
Representative Kaplan has a question
 
06:18:05.788 --> 06:18:05.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
06:18:08.468 --> 06:18:08.478 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald uh this will be quick uh
 
06:18:10.708 --> 06:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
currently the bill uh envisions the
 
06:18:12.830 --> 06:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
department of energy as being the the
 
06:18:14.830 --> 06:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
agency that houses this pilot program
 
06:18:16.628 --> 06:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
would this be more appropriate in your
 
06:18:18.390 --> 06:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
agency or
 
06:18:21.310 --> 06:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
Department um we've had discussions uh
 
06:18:26.150 --> 06:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
on this with um doe and uh uh just just
 
06:18:27.590 --> 06:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
so you're familiar the way that Reggie
 
06:18:29.548 --> 06:18:29.558 align:start position:0%
works is we we're the agency that
 
06:18:31.548 --> 06:18:31.558 align:start position:0%
implements the Reggie auction program
 
06:18:33.868 --> 06:18:33.878 align:start position:0%
and so on WE manage the program but all
 
06:18:35.990 --> 06:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
the Reggie funding comes into doe it
 
06:18:39.310 --> 06:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
formerly went to the Pu um and that's
 
06:18:41.070 --> 06:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
because it's it's funding that comes
 
06:18:44.150 --> 06:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
from Electric rate payers ultimately and
 
06:18:47.590 --> 06:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
so at that time back 10 12 years ago or
 
06:18:51.350 --> 06:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
more we decided um jointly that that the
 
06:18:54.430 --> 06:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
two agencies would would that Doe would
 
06:18:57.350 --> 06:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
manage the the money side of it we would
 
06:18:59.548 --> 06:18:59.558 align:start position:0%
manage the participation and Reggie
 
06:19:00.670 --> 06:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
auction and
 
06:19:02.750 --> 06:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
environmental uh pieces of it and we
 
06:19:04.708 --> 06:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
would work jointly the way that the
 
06:19:07.110 --> 06:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
Reggie program works is that one
 
06:19:08.430 --> 06:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner from an environmental
 
06:19:12.590 --> 06:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
agency and one commissioner from a uh
 
06:19:16.230 --> 06:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
utility regulatory agency is uh is on
 
06:19:18.270 --> 06:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
the board of Reggie from each state so
 
06:19:20.868 --> 06:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
that most States Implement in that way
 
06:19:23.310 --> 06:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
it's a long roundabout way of answering
 
06:19:26.868 --> 06:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
your question which is that um uh doe
 
06:19:29.390 --> 06:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
currently runs rebate programs for
 
06:19:31.430 --> 06:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
energy programs and that sort of thing
 
06:19:34.310 --> 06:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
we don't have that any of that type of
 
06:19:38.230 --> 06:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh program uh so our thought process was
 
06:19:40.270 --> 06:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
If This Were to come in we're certainly
 
06:19:43.030 --> 06:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
open to it but um we we think it's more
 
06:19:44.868 --> 06:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
consistent with the programs that Doe
 
06:19:47.030 --> 06:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
runs and I'm sure Mr Griffin is shaking
 
06:19:52.670 --> 06:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:55.948 --> 06:19:55.958 align:start position:0%
disbelief is he on camera at least any
 
06:19:59.190 --> 06:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
other questions for Mr
 
06:20:01.788 --> 06:20:01.798 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald seeing none thank you for
 
06:20:03.510 --> 06:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you volunteering to come by this
 
06:20:06.230 --> 06:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon and answering our questions so
 
06:20:08.390 --> 06:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
with that we'll close the public hearing
 
06:20:10.750 --> 06:20:10.760 align:start position:0%

06:20:10.760 --> 06:20:12.350 align:start position:0%
