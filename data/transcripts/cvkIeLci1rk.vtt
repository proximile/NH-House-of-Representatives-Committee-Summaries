amendments whatever okay based on
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard and some
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
different ideas about um what would work
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
and what wouldn't
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%

153 representative H Haskins thank you
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair in the absence of the chair
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the subcommittee I would say that we
 
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
don't have any new information
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay I I do understand that um based on
 
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
testimony representative ktoa had some
 
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
ideas about yes how she wanted to make
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
some changes to it representative P
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps I I I assume we're expecting her
 
00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:47.079 align:start position:0%
in a little while yeah she's in the
 
00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
chair's Vice chairs meeting okay so
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
maybe we can just return to this when
 
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
she gets back sure we'll do that and I
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
just not I just realize that um my
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment for the second bill from now
 
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
is sitting upstairs so I'm gonna just
 
00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:05.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.959 --> 00:10:08.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay um now our next bill that we wanted
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
to discuss was
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
hp215 FN requiring a landfill permit
 
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
applicant to submit a report listing
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
potential harms and benefits of the
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
project and I believe that was also
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
um sent to a subcommittee if you'd like
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
to give us a a report of that
 
00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:35.079 align:start position:0%
representative King yeah so that was
 
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
sent to solid way subcommittee and um
 
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative ger is uh Leading The Way
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
with uh amendments and working with the
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
um with the department and maybe he can
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
speak more on that but what I plan on
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
doing is just once I find out next week
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
when we're going to meet for our regular
 
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
committee I'll just schedule um schedule
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
our subcommittee to meet 1 hour before
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
then and I'll send an email out to
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
everybody and that'll be for both 2:15
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
and 240 okay I can give you that now
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
because I was working on the committee
 
00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:13.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.959 --> 00:11:15.509 align:start position:0%
 
Tuesday

00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
Tuesday
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
um I am planning a
 
00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:22.839 align:start position:0%
caucus uh for for us between n any could
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
be 915 to 9:30 but um we're going to
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
start our our work here here at 9:30 so
 
00:11:33.629 --> 00:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
if you want to schedule something before
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
then yeah we'll probably meet around uh
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
8:15 then I'm assuming that would give
 
00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:41.959 align:start position:0%
us a full hour probably won't need that
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm imagining but gives us a full
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
hour and then we'd still have time for
 
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.069 align:start position:0%
hour and then we'd still have time for
caucuses

00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
so okay so that would be Tuesday
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
February 11 and that's when your
 
00:11:57.629 --> 00:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would work and to do that
 
00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm imagining
 
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
that we would be able to EXA that bill
 
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
Tuesday February 18 so that gives you
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
about a week um to work on amendments or
 
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
whatever representative gerana U thank
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
you madam chair yeah just so a quick
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
update on this bill I did meet with uh
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
director whims on Friday and um I'm uh
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
we've got some really cool ideas I think
 
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
about how to amend the bill along the
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
lines that the committee had discussed
 
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
one of things that we're looking at is a
 
00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
having a preliminary screening phase
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
which is where the the the net public
 
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
benefit would be determined and we
 
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
talked about how that could be written
 
00:12:41.069 --> 00:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
in such a way as to allow Dees to
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
collaborate with some other agencies uh
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
and and also to flesh out the benefits
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
side of of things uh in that bill right
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
now we've got a list of potential harms
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
but the only benefit currently in
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
statute as we've talked about is
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
capacity need so we're also looking at
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
introducing some langu
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
that would uh include some other
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
possible benefits economic benefits
 
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure benefits so to create a
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
balanced list of both potential harms
 
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
and potential benefits oh that sounds
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
good so um I have a draft of that
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
language I have sent to the director to
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
ask for his feedback on uh and so an
 
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
amendment is in the works along those
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
lines okay sounds
 
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
good any other comments questions about
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
HB 215
 
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.069 align:start position:0%
HB 215
seeing

00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
none um moving on to HB 240 removing the
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
penalty of forfeiture for non-payment of
 
00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:38.030 align:start position:0%
penalty of forfeiture for non-payment of
dog

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
dog
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
licenses and I understand representative
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
Bixby that you have an amendment for
 
00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:54.110 align:start position:0%
Bixby that you have an amendment for
that

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
bill and seeing as that we're planning
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
on executing that this morning
 
00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:01.959 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh going over this would be a good a
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
good thing okay so um so just uh just a
 
00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
review to uh turn the the list of um
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
many many numbers into actual uh words
 
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
um this bill is about um the this bill
 
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
was brought forward because of a concern
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
about the uh way that um for fure of uh
 
00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:31.790 align:start position:0%
about the uh way that um for fure of uh
pet

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
pet
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
dogs uh comes up in the statutes and uh
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
as a potential penalty for failing to
 
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
pay uh your dog license or or failure to
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
license your dog and uh the way that it
 
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
is currently written in statute uh it
 
00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:53.959 align:start position:0%
says that uh the city city government
 
00:14:59.069 --> 00:14:59.079 align:start position:0%
shall send a uh warrant to the person
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
who is not cooperating uh which would
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
threaten to confiscate the dog uh the
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
way that there are no so far we had no
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
evidence of any confiscations happening
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh for this purpose in the state we just
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh but it does and uh we have evidence
 
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
that uh government officials seem to try
 
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
to find a way to work around this uh but
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
in fact it does say in statute that they
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
that that warrant shall be issued uh the
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
there is a May in terms of the
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
confiscation but in terms of the issuing
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
the warrant is a shall um and uh this
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
was an issue for concern uh for the
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
constituent one of the constituents of
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor uh and this so
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
um the committee last week uh pretty
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
much said that uh they felt that um
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
figuring out some way to establish
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
leeway on the part of government uh
 
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
municipal government officials in terms
 
00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:08.759 align:start position:0%
of the issuing of the warrant would be a
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
good way to go and uh so I was thinking
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
about how to do that and I thought you
 
00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:16.839 align:start position:0%
know maybe it requires a full a full
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
sentence of explanation or maybe it just
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
requires a a one-word change so and I
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure so I just went to OS because
 
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
they have really good people there who
 
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
can uh help you figure out uh what needs
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
to happen so I brought it to OS and they
 
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
and um the person I was working with
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
said basically the simplest and more
 
00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
straightforward way to do this is just
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
to change the Sha to a May that provides
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
the leeway for the government officials
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
it doesn't create a list of exceptions
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
BEC and which is a good thing because
 
00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
whenever you start a list of exceptions
 
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
it gets longer and longer and longer and
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
less and less wieldy so uh this is the
 
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
most efficient way to do it I think um
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
and it just in line 11 changes the word
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
shall to the word May and that gives
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
enough leeway for the
 
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
um uh for the municipal
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
officials okay um representative k
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
please take your seat representative
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
and see if he was u a a to this change
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
yes I had an email exchange with him and
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
he said oh that's much simpler than what
 
00:17:36.029 --> 00:17:36.039 align:start position:0%
I was thinking and much better thank you
 
00:17:36.039 --> 00:17:38.990 align:start position:0%
I was thinking and much better thank you
very

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.549 align:start position:0%
 
much

00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%

any questions or comments or concerns
about

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
hb24 okay seeing none thank you
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
um since representative ktoa is here um
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
I want to just circle back to the HB 153
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
bill as we're talking about in for the
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
work session um requiring that two or
 
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
more law enforcement officers in each
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
County receive training regarding animal
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
cruelty do you have any update for us on
 
00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um the
 
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
committee I believe will be work U
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
meeting on February 14th um I believe
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
that I just have to double check with
 
00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
members but I think most are available
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
at that time um I'd also like to know if
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
they're available at 9:00 a.m. as
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to a 10:00 a.m. start but we can
 
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
talk about that after so that is the
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
plan is to have a work session on that
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
right representative Bixby so uh are you
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
uh going to be looking into the notion
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
of the task force that the uh person
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
from uh police training mentioned uh I I
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
think we're going to explore all avenues
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
I think that's the way to go um and uh I
 
00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:12.039 align:start position:0%
wasn't here for his particular testimony
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
but I uh was trying to look for the
 
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
video last night um to go over that but
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
if you have his name uh that'd be great
 
00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:20.990 align:start position:0%
if you have his name uh that'd be great
okay

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.270 align:start position:0%
okay
thanks

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:30.039 align:start position:0%
okay okay so then uh we can move on to
 
00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:31.430 align:start position:0%
okay okay so then uh we can move on to
HB

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
566 requiring permit applications for
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
new landfills to contain a detailed plan
 
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
for lee8
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
management uh representative king would
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
you give us an update on that so the
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
information in regards to 566 is the
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
exact same as 2115 I misspoke earlier I
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
think I said uh 240 was the other bill
 
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so HB 566 will be discussed in your
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee as well yeah
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%

testimony on that bill that I've heard
 
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
in this committee though
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%

director whimet we're working on
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
language my intent is to have amendments
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%

um is
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
what what's the thrust of uh changes
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
that would occur for that
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
bill so with uh
 
00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
566 the lee8 management uh there was a
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
kind of draft of language I shared with
 
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
the committee uh last time last week and
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
that has been submitted uh as an
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
amendment so the amendment to that bill
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
is uh already in the works and the
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
committee has seen the language that we
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
that we're putting into an amendment and
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
I can recirculate it if folks would like
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
and with 171 last week director whim sat
 
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
uh had some advice for some technical
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
changes to language and uh he is going
 
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
to get that to me this week and so there
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
some small changes but uh in the wording
 
00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:45.799 align:start position:0%
to make it more technically correct for
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
for HB 171 yes for 171 okay thank
 
00:21:53.549 --> 00:21:53.559 align:start position:0%
you um all right
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
so is is HB 171 also going to be
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
discussed in your
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we hadn't uh we hadn't sent
 
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%
it there yet but we can if if we if
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
everybody's amenable to that I have no
 
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
problem all right
 
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
um okay so yeah that would work great
 
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
because my again my plan is to have an
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to share uh by next week so it
 
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
would be easy enough to bring that
 
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the solid waste
 
00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we can discuss it
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh okay and what's the nature of the
 
00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:29.750 align:start position:0%
uh okay and what's the nature of the
change

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen the specific uh language
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
that the director recommended yet so I'm
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
waiting to hear from the director as he
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
said it's a change not to the content
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
but some of the technical language of
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
that bill okay thank you represent Bixby
 
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
yes one of the issues uh that D director
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
whtat brought up is that there is
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
currently in statute a um a provision
 
00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:54.039 align:start position:0%
that says that if a department hasn't
 
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
acted on a bill within a certain time
 
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
window and I think it's like three
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
months then the then it automatic then
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
the rules go into effect automatically
 
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
without uh without any changes so um so
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
in or no not not not a rule not a rule a
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
permit so if if the depart if a
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
department receives a permit and uh they
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
don't uh they they don't act on it in
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
any way to either approve it or deny it
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
then it automat automatically gets
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
approved within three months oh that's
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
not good uh that was uh well I that's
 
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
the way it is and I I didn't vote for
 
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
that one myself but that's that's been
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
in law for about uh four four or five
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
terms now um so
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
um uh but in any case he pointed out
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
that that law would come into effect and
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
there is a way there's a relative he
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
also pointed out there's a there are a
 
00:23:59.549 --> 00:23:59.559 align:start position:0%
couple of Rel atively straightforward
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
ways of dealing with it so that it won't
 
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
come into effect but uh but that it
 
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be dealt with or else
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
um permits would just get automatically
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
approved okay yeah so what represent I'm
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you m sure uh yeah and thank
 
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby uh for
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
reminding us because I'd forgotten about
 
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
that part yes so I think that in the end
 
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
We'll add a notwithstanding Clause uh in
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
order to deal with that but thank you I
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
do remember that was one of the the
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
technical language issues that is being
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
addressed in an amendment okay thank you
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
represent Penza oh she had her hand up
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
no she's
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.440 align:start position:0%

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
representative Penza returns we can ask
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
her okay
 
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:06.520 align:start position:0%

um does anybody have any questions or
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
Bill okay um this is a work session for
 
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
committee members but um if if everybody
 
00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
is fine with that we can uh speak with
 
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
representative P representative Bixby
 
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd just like to make a note
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
initially that uh I think that the idea
 
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
behind this bill is very important we
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that our uh
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
firefighter fighting uh operations get
 
00:25:51.389 --> 00:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for equipment that's damaged
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
due to uh reasons beyond their control
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
but I think that the mechanism that was
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
proposed in the bill initially doesn't
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
work so I'm I'm eager to hear what the
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
amendment looks like and uh and then we
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
can work work from there to see if uh
 
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
that will get the results that we want
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions or comments
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
before represent P I invite you to come
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
to the table there you can pass out your
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
copy of your Amendment and we can
 
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
discuss uh how these changes might
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
morning Madam chair and the rest of the
 
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh the last time we spoke I
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
was suggested that I clean this up it
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
did okay how does so no payment plan as
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
it was described it's just a straight
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
penalty $1,000 a day after the 90 days
 
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.669 align:start position:0%
penalty $1,000 a day after the 90 days
of

00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
non-payment until they pay the bill
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
Yeah question representative uh comto
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so the only change
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
here that I see is that you took out
 
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
interest assessed at the rate of a right
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
and no was like a
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
20% not in this section it was plus
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
interest we talked about it but we took
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
out the interest just a straight
 
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
penalty uh nothing else okay thank you
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chair uh thank you for your
 
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment um I was reading this
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
and the question I have for you is um
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
are there similar rsas where fines and
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
colle fines that are charged against
 
00:28:45.149 --> 00:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
someone for violation rues so forth are
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
have been collected in that procedure
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
that's working now that we could adopt
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
an existing Fine Collection system or
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
fee collection system that's in another
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
RSA I'm not sure okay okay represent
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
Bixby okay so um you had mentioned when
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
you were uh speaking last week that uh
 
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
the the it sounded kind of like the
 
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
fines would go towards paying the
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
balance of the charge and I just want to
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
make sure that in this case the the the
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh the charge to the um per to the um
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
person who's against whom the claim is
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
being made is is still is separate from
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
the from the penalties that any penalty
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
is on top of that correct they have a
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
Bill of X and then after n 90 days
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
$1,000 penalty per day will be
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
charged with that with that initial on
 
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
top of that initial bill okay I think
 
00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:51.559 align:start position:0%
this provides a a sufficient
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
stick representative coma thank you
 
00:29:57.549 --> 00:29:57.559 align:start position:0%
madam chair um in listening to your
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
testimony it seemed like a lot of the
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
um this comes from insurance companies
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
correct um however the claimant would be
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
whoever holds the policy if the
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
insurance company doesn't pay the
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
claimant uh for 180 days then they're
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
still have to pay the fine of the $1,000
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
per day for an additional 90 days
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
correct I would say so but anybody that
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
deals with hazardous
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
materials has to have a million at least
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
a million dollars of insurance for a
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
spill as I understand it okay you
 
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
followup so what I'm saying is is for 90
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
days if the insurance company doesn't
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
get that claim paid within the initial
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
90 days the claimant is then on the hook
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
for an additional thousand for the next
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
90 days is that correct so I would
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
assume it would be the insurance company
 
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
because they are the party that is
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
responsible to pay the
 
00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
bill right because the the operator of s
 
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
facility has insurance to cover that to
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
take the responsibility for
 
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
that I I understand what you're saying
 
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just reading the Bill thank you okay
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
so I have a concern about this as it
 
00:31:30.669 --> 00:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
might relate to
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
homeowners homeowners that may not know
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
that they have a hazardous you know
 
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
hazardous material um you know an
 
00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:41.559 align:start position:0%
underground oil tank or some other kind
 
00:31:41.559 --> 00:31:43.509 align:start position:0%
underground oil tank or some other kind
of

00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
um so as containers as I understand it
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
oil uh tanks are covered by homeowners
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
insurance so when they let go the
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
insurance kicks
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
in and and and if not I believe a lot of
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
the oil companies have spill mitigation
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
uh that will come in and clean up the
 
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
oil okay but I'm still concerned that um
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
homeowners could be stuck with this if
 
00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
the insurance company's not paying the
 
00:32:21.389 --> 00:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
bill or for for whatever reason that a
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
homeowner may be the one subjected to um
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
this kind of fine which is a you know a
 
00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:32.919 align:start position:0%
hefty exorbitant fine correct and and I
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
see that you know you're you're you're
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
in your thought you're directing this to
 
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
collecting funds from uh insurance
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
companies but what
 
00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
happens in the case that you know there
 
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
is no maybe the homeowner doesn't have
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
ins homeowners insurance so as you heard
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
in in testimony before we've had very
 
00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.549 align:start position:0%
in in testimony before we've had very
few

00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
few
 
00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
home in
 
00:33:02.509 --> 00:33:02.519 align:start position:0%
home hasmat incidents that the team has
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
been called out
 
00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
to and and you also heard that a couple
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
of them have never paid and we've never
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
pursued it because we understand you
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
cannot get blood from a stone right so
 
00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.190 align:start position:0%
cannot get blood from a stone right so
it

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't help us or to say we're going to
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
find you when we know there's no money
 
00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:24.919 align:start position:0%
there right and move on and most of
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
those small spills are very small in a
 
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
home and can be handled quite easily at
 
00:33:36.029 --> 00:33:36.039 align:start position:0%
very little expense okay but would we
 
00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:38.919 align:start position:0%
should we do you believe should we put
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
some sort of exemption on
 
00:33:46.629 --> 00:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
homeowners uh who you know maybe cannot
 
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
pay that or
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
whatever if if we could develop some
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
sort of language that would um make sure
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
that the homeowner is protected uh from
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
EX AB Orbin at
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
fees are they going to be responsible to
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
pay the
 
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
fee um well you you're you're going
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
You're primarily looking for payment
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
from insurance companies correct okay
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's a way so if there's no insurance
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
company then probably not going to go
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
after it yeah but all right um
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman you had your hand
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
up and then representative minor I did
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
coming in front of US Representative so
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
I I want I kind of wanted to pull back
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
to the original attent of the bill which
 
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079 align:start position:0%
was the fact that small fire departments
 
00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:39.079 align:start position:0%
who had been engaged in um in mitigating
 
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials could no longer use
 
00:34:44.589 --> 00:34:44.599 align:start position:0%
their Hazmat gear because it was
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
contaminated and subsequently the money
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
was falling on the local taxpayers to
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
replace that gear is that not correct
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
that is correct so may I have a follow
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so basically what
 
00:34:59.470 --> 00:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
this and and through your testimony you
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
had stated that 99% of those
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
instances are corporations businesses
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
people who deal with hazardous materials
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
all the time and only maybe 1% were
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
private residences is that correct that
 
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:15.870 align:start position:0%
private residences is that correct that
is

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
correct follow up thank you very much so
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
in order to mitigate the damages to
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
these small fire departments and not
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
pass the burden on to the local
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers your bill wants to be able to
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
go after those companies directly in
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
order to collect the money in order to
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
replace your hasm suits is that correct
 
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
correct thank you okay representative
 
00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
Miner thank you madam chairman thank you
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Pro for um testifying
 
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
again before us today uh a question on
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
what constitutes a spill how many
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
gallons constitutes a spill when does
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hazmat have to get
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
involved they just changed it what is it
 
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.589 align:start position:0%
involved they just changed it what is it
now

00:35:58.589 --> 00:35:58.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
15 Gallons
 
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
petroleum gas oil or such so after that
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
it kicks it up um but other houses um
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
materials that may be poisonous or um
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
acidic or alkaline sure uh maybe a
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
smaller amount okay thank you
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative Howard thank
 
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and hello representative
 
00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:29.720 align:start position:0%
um would would there be a a lower risk
 
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
to um the materials and the and the gear
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
that you use when you have when you deal
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
with an
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
underground tank like you would with a a
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
domestic situation correct so
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
underground tank that leaks we may never
 
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
be even called except to maybe uh assess
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
the the situation because there's no
 
00:36:59.790 --> 00:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
active um hazard to the house next door
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
or anything like that because know the
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
fumes are out in the air so they whoever
 
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
owns that tank is now going to be
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
responsible to get a cleanup company to
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
come in and mitigate that yeah sure
 
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
followup so so would that just indicate
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
a lesser risk or um to the department in
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
a in a domestic situation and therefore
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
sort of an implied um um
 
00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.550 align:start position:0%
sort of an implied um um
exemption

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
yeah okay representative Bixby so
 
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
um there is a uh oil spill mitigation
 
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
fund uh which is used in part to do
 
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
ProActive Management by replacing tanks
 
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
that are getting more helping people
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
replace tanks that are going getting
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
worn out and I believe that fund can
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
also be used to help clean up with
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
spills does uh do fire departments ever
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
are are they able to access access any
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
of those funds to replace equipment or
 
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
is that totally separate I believe it's
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
totally separate but I'm not 100% sure
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
on that thank you I think we would need
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
to do some investigating on that on that
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
point I think I I think that for the
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
purposes of this bill I think I my guess
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
is that it it's it doesn't it's not
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
going to play a whole lot of role in
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
this bill and the only question is do we
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
want to include some sort of language
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
that provides leeway on the part of the
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
um the uh Department that's enforcing
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
the uh this charge to the responsible
 
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
party right uh so
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh I'm okay with putting something in
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
for uh if the homeowner's insurance
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay then we will not go after
 
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.750 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay then we will not go after
the

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
homeowner representative Kwa thank you
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair um
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
a concern I have here and is with the
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
agriculture uh and the hobby farmer um
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
who has uh pesticides and as we just
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
heard 15 gallons of petroleum is not a
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
lot of petroleum if you have
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
tractors and even though you might be
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
doing everything properly um on your
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
farm and having a diesel tank outside
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
and having it on that cement slab and
 
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
making sure all the proper guidelines
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
but if something happens or something
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
catches on fire
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
um based on the criteria 15 Gallons some
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's going to require Hazmat based on
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
um for that to kick in based on what you
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
what we were just told 15 gallons of
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
petroleum is that correct that is
 
00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:50.839 align:start position:0%
correct so um so for the committee I I
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
just want us to really consider um the
 
00:39:58.349 --> 00:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
consequences that it could have have on
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
our hobby farmers in our agriculture in
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
the state um we are all anyone that has
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
pesticides on their property is required
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
by law that sprays uh is required by law
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
to have a um pesticide license uh if
 
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
they're selling their product and um one
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
of the things that we go over and in the
 
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
classes and everything and is how to
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
mitigate possible spills or leakage or
 
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
any of that stuff and I would hope that
 
00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:32.839 align:start position:0%
most of them have insurance um and that
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
the insurance company would pay in a
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
timely manner however if they
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
don't and we say that they'll be
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for the additional fees but
 
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
the insurance company actually decides
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
what they're going to pay it's not up to
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
the homeowner and that really concerns
 
00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
me so that's just my thoughts and I know
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
I I think we also have to be um
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
cognizant of of a sense of scale here
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
and what we're what we're talking about
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
is uh a hazardous waste release that is
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
of sufficient size to damage the fire
 
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
firefighters uh equipment and if we're
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
talking about a gallon or two of uh
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
Roundup that's probably not of the scale
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to cause a huge problem um
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
or or you know
 
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
whatever um pyin
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
or uh the the scale that uh that a hobby
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
Farm is going to have pesticides at that
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
is unlikely to cause a whole lot of
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
damage to firefighting
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
equipment um no it would be correct but
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
I'm so I'm wondering if it would be more
 
00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:50.839 align:start position:0%
acceptable I'm sorry yeah I will get to
 
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
represent wheeler uh I I'm wondering if
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
it would be more acceptable to say in
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
addition to this amendment a penalty of
 
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
$1,000 per day will be paid to the
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
claimant for each day of non-payment
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
Beyond 90 days unless
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
other uh Arrangements have been made or
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
are made is that something no I don't
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
know okay all right representative
 
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you madam chair I was
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
going to say much of what representative
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
Bixby said about the amount of spill
 
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
causing damage on the firefighter's
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
equipment it would take a pretty
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
significant spill in a hobby Farm to
 
00:42:30.549 --> 00:42:30.559 align:start position:0%
cause the damage that we're talking
 
00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
about here to the firefighters gear and
 
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
in my opinion if that did happen on a
 
00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:37.559 align:start position:0%
hobby farm that goes onto the taxpayer's
 
00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
dollar if we don't have someone who's
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
paying it and and and that farm is
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
responsible if if they damage the
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters gear to the point where the
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
they need to seek uh some kind of uh
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
fixing that gear then the taxpayer
 
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
should not be burdened with that
 
00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.390 align:start position:0%
should not be burdened with that
person's

00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
person's
 
00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:01.559 align:start position:0%
transgression on on the town uh so I I
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
would hope that to me this legislation
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
is properly written as it as it stands
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
you would get an initial bill for
 
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
whatever damage you you incurred and
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
then after that if you don't pay after
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
90 days there'd be a $1,000 a day you
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
know who knows what that bill might be
 
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
maybe it's $25 in damage you know if
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
it's a hobby Farm I would assume it
 
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
would be not the $50,000 in damage that
 
00:43:26.829 --> 00:43:26.839 align:start position:0%
representative PR brought for it as an
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
example example when he brought this
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
bill for it I think it would be
 
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
significantly less and then for some
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
reason if you don't pay after 90 days
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
that significantly less bill I don't see
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
a problem with incurring a fine of
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
$1,000 a day even if you're a
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
homeowner representative
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair and and I
 
00:43:47.549 --> 00:43:47.559 align:start position:0%
share the concern about the individual
 
00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
homeowner and if if there's some way we
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
can kind of provide safeguards for that
 
00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh and and also for representative
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
comtois points about Hobby Farmers uh
 
00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
the one thing that does concern me
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
though is that if people are genuinely
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
negligent with the storage of things so
 
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's possible you know
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
if there's a determination when you look
 
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
at the the cause of the fire if there's
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
a determination that it was caused by
 
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
negligence right if if there can be a
 
00:44:17.549 --> 00:44:17.559 align:start position:0%
distinction there right because to me if
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
if if you are negligent in the storage
 
00:44:22.589 --> 00:44:22.599 align:start position:0%
of these chemicals and it results in a
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
fire and it damages equipment then you
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
should be on the hook for it however if
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
you have been doing everything right and
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
it was not your fault that this happened
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
that to me is is someone who shouldn't
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
be hit with such a heavy F so I don't
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
know if there's a way to make a
 
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
distinction based upon the determination
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
of the cause of the fire and whether or
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
not negligence was a contributing factor
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative Freeman and saitis
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um representative
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
would you would you be I can't see now I
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
took my glasses off that was silly um
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
would would you be agreeable excuse me
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
to amending the amendment to include the
 
00:45:06.549 --> 00:45:06.559 align:start position:0%
language um something like unless other
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
arrangements for payment have been made
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
and that would cover everybody's
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
concerns about Hobby Farmers
 
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
homeowners if there's some latitude to
 
00:45:22.549 --> 00:45:22.559 align:start position:0%
allow those fire departments to make
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
payment arrangements and take it by a
 
00:45:27.549 --> 00:45:27.559 align:start position:0%
case take it on a Case by case situation
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
instead of just an overall
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
generalization I think that might
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
address the issues that are coming up
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
which are all very valid but this bill
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
would be 17 pages long if we did that so
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
that that might help to just allow them
 
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
the latitude to get what they need to
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
get but know that whoever they're
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
dealing with will be handled on a
 
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
case-by casee basis representative
 
00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.390 align:start position:0%
case-by casee basis representative
sofikitis

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
sofikitis
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning do you know
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
what's the practice in other
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
states for this sort of
 
00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
thing usually in other states their
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
Hazmat teams are funded by the
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
state okay and this problem does not
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
exist thank
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby thank you for
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
asking so um I'm I've been thinking a
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
little bit about the phrasing of this
 
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
and um and how this and and I'm
 
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
beginning to remember how this is on uh
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
phrased in in other statutes having to
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
do with particularly with
 
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
departmental uh penalties for violation
 
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
and usually the phrasing is a penalty of
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
no greater than x per day so if we
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
change this to a penalty of no greater
 
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
than $1,000 per day that would allow the
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
municipality uh to say uh if if it's a
 
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
case of a homeowner whose insurance
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
claim has being delayed they could
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
say uh we see you're working on it your
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
penalty is going to be you know for the
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
you know as long as you are continuing
 
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
to pursue this appropriately your pen
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
penalty is zero uh and if uh so so and
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
and it could be scale anywhere in there
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
depending on how big a stick is needed
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
to uh get compliance but I think that
 
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
the goal of getting compliance is really
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
the key to this and uh if you have
 
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
someone who is uh really being
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
belligerent then you need a big stick
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
but if you if you have someone who's
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
cooperating then you can uh you don't
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
need the
 
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
stick representative wheeler and then
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa thank you madam
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
chair if someone is not paying for 90
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
days they're not cooperating and I think
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
that they should incur a fine for
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
damaging the gear of the firefighters
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
out but what we're talking about here is
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
$1,000 per day after 90 days of
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
non-payment so you get a bill and you
 
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
don't pay it for almost two months and
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
and three months thank you can't count
 
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
obviously the for almost three months
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
and then we're worried about the $1,000
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
a day fine that to me is silly if you
 
00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:20.839 align:start position:0%
damage the firefighters Hazmat gear in a
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
situation where there is necessary to
 
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
have Hazmat gear which would be a pretty
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
intense situation especially if if it
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
was damaged and you don't pay for 90
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
days after that situation or you get the
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
bill I I think that you should incur
 
00:48:38.349 --> 00:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
$1,000 fine okay representative ktoa and
 
00:48:41.309 --> 00:48:41.319 align:start position:0%
then Scully and then Bixby thank you
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair and and thank you can you
 
00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
tell me how your gear gets
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
ruined in a hazardous with hazardous
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
materials say whether it's petroleum
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
or so a lot of times that cannot be
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
removed it it'll eventually start
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
degrading the material of the Hazmat
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
suit depending on the
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
chemical again I have uh uh the chief
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
back there who has better knowledge of
 
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
that may Madam chair sure so what you're
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
saying is if petroleum gets on the suit
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's basically ruined correct because I
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
really don't like going into a fire with
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
oil all over my gear that that that
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
would um make perfect sense so it could
 
00:49:29.069 --> 00:49:29.079 align:start position:0%
be any amount of
 
00:49:32.829 --> 00:49:32.839 align:start position:0%
petroleum one little dot no my whole arm
 
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
is covered yep and what would cause your
 
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
whole arm to be covered well when I'm
 
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
walking in a pool of oil and my feet
 
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
come out from underneath me because it's
 
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.549 align:start position:0%
come out from underneath me because it's
that

00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:47.789 --> 00:49:47.799 align:start position:0%
slippery I was covered from head to toe
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you represent Skully thank
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you again for
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
coming before us um again I
 
00:49:59.309 --> 00:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
as it's currently worded I am troubled
 
00:50:01.789 --> 00:50:01.799 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of protections for
 
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
homeowners and small farmers um I'm
 
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
troubled that there's no proportionality
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh regarding how much you want to charge
 
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
people in relation to what the actual
 
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
bill is and I'm troubled that there's no
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
cap so that if you had a $5,000 bill
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%
theoretically you could end up charging
 
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
for somebody a hundred times that
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
because of of the delay in getting
 
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
payments so I'm just letting you know
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
that as it's written now I I I'm
 
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
troubled with it I represent and if I
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
can answer that okay I'm sorry we're not
 
00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:35.799 align:start position:0%
going to go after the 5,000 it's
 
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
$178,000 for gear
 
00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
equipment and materials used right the
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
small house and the the the farmer AR
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
aren't the problem because in 15 gallons
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
of oil I don't fall down in and and we
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
can mitigate that quite easily right 20
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
gallons maybe even 100 gallons but when
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
you get up to 1,000 gallons 3,000
 
00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
gallons of oil on fire at you that's
 
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
that's a whole different situation
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
somebody spills a little extra
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
pesticides not a big deal that can be
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
handled quite
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
easily represent big spe but I'm I'm
 
00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
willing to to put something
 
00:51:27.549 --> 00:51:27.559 align:start position:0%
in yeah I I think that um
 
00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
the the issue of the 90 days I I think
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
that we do need to provide some
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
flexibility there because um I don't
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
know how many of us have had to deal
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
with an insurance company getting to and
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
getting them to pay a bill but it is not
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
always an easy process and it doesn't
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
always happy happen within 90 days and
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
we don't want to create a penalty where
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
there is no leeway for someone who is
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
trying earnestly to get their insurance
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
company to pay up and and uh and the
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
insurance company is being slow on the
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
other hand we do need to have some sort
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
of Stickin law so I think that the idea
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
of having it up to then gives the
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
municipality clear legal leeway to say
 
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
okay we're not going to charge the
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
penalty we know you're working on
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
it okay uh representative saitis here
 
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
previously no worries um perhaps you or
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
the chief could give us a
 
00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
ballpark of how much this hazardous
 
00:52:30.359 --> 00:52:31.829 align:start position:0%
ballpark of how much this hazardous
suits

00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
suits
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.549 --> 00:52:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.559 --> 00:52:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
up

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
R 50,000 the last incident we've had
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
50,000 for
 
00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
eeping uh so how much each suit so all
 
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
the suits we spend 5,000 for each
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
suit they're
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
expensive does that include the house
 
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
sorry doesn't include the helmet go
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
ahead okay thank follow up yeah you're
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
you're okay okay representa Howard thank
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
you madam chair so um I just want to
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
reiterate that uh what um representative
 
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
Bixby has been saying that um having a
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
little bit of leeway about how much you
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
penalize people gives you room
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
at the municipality at um level to to
 
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
understand people's circumstances in
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
their ability to pay and um and I think
 
00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.589 align:start position:0%
their ability to pay and um and I think
that

00:53:38.589 --> 00:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh I another Point sorry I think I might
 
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
have forgotten it but um but I I do
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
think that that's that that oh I know
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
what it was if we take if we put too
 
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
many conditions in here we're going to
 
00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
take the teeth out of it so I think that
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
that simple phrase from from
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby or something like
 
00:53:58.829 --> 00:53:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.789 --> 00:54:01.799 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:03.799 align:start position:0%
comments anybody have any other
 
00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
questions for represent
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
P okay so um clearly we'll um have to
 
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
work on an amendment for this and uh
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
would you like me to get
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
it um perhaps somebody would work with
 
00:54:26.589 --> 00:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:29.549 --> 00:54:29.559 align:start position:0%
I I think the only the only point I'd
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
like to make is that the bill is now the
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
Committees so it should be a Committee
 
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
Member who is the lead sponsor on the
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
amendment right so which and that so if
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
you want to work with representative PR
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
on it that would be great but I would
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate I would appreciate it
 
00:54:46.829 --> 00:54:46.839 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby if you would
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
consult with us as well absolutely
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
because I think we're saying the same
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
thing but in a different manner so I I
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
think it would be important to drill
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
down on that I think I have I think I
 
00:54:58.349 --> 00:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
can cover in about three minutes the
 
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
wording that we need to change it to
 
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you so much but I really
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
want to stress the concerns that
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative coma has um be recognized
 
00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
for whatever in whatever amending
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
language you figure out so in terms of
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
the in terms of the penalty having it
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
possible for the municipality to say the
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
penalty is zero going forward solves
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
that entirely if you want but if you're
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
getting into how much is the how much is
 
00:55:31.789 --> 00:55:31.799 align:start position:0%
the charge for the damaged equipment
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
that is um that's a calculation that
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
happens in a different paragraph of the
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
law than this bill is dealing with and
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
uh would probably require a much more
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
extent I I suspect that would May well
 
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
be a non- gerine Amendment and would
 
00:55:51.789 --> 00:55:51.799 align:start position:0%
require new um uh a new hearing so or or
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
it might be another bill but it so so I
 
00:55:59.230 --> 00:55:59.240 align:start position:0%
think that for the purposes of this bill
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh and and I I guess the other thing is
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
that problems have not cropped up with
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
the other parts of the statute it's just
 
00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
the getting people to uh getting large
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
offenders to pay up is is the problem so
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
I think that we we don't need to drill
 
00:56:17.549 --> 00:56:17.559 align:start position:0%
into the rest of the statute I think
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
that if we just um make the amendment to
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
the bill that will give the leeway that
 
00:56:27.069 --> 00:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
uh to have the penalty range from zero
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
to a thousand um that will solve the
 
00:56:34.029 --> 00:56:34.039 align:start position:0%
issue Representatives uh grber and then
 
00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:37.720 align:start position:0%
ktoa um representative scully's uh uh
 
00:56:39.789 --> 00:56:39.799 align:start position:0%
concerns I I think are very important to
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
take under consideration too I support
 
00:56:43.789 --> 00:56:43.799 align:start position:0%
many of the things most the things you
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
said in your Amendment representative K
 
00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate um the wording no
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
greater than um that representative
 
00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
Bixby has
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
suggested um what if and I'll just I
 
00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:05.799 align:start position:0%
mean I always do the wh ifs um someone's
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
homeowner's insurance or insurance
 
00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.789 align:start position:0%
homeowner's insurance or insurance
doesn't

00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
cover um do you and the other thing was
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
is it seems like this bill has been
 
00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:16.839 align:start position:0%
being brought forward for a very
 
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
specific accident that has happened I
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
don't believe this can be done this will
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
go retroactive and will affect that will
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
it represent Bixby legislation is never
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
retroactive thank you no and it's not
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
just the one the one was the straw that
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
broke the camel's
 
00:57:37.599 --> 00:57:39.390 align:start position:0%
broke the camel's
back

00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
okay okay um any other questions or
 
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
comments okay so um representative
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
Freeman representative Bixby and also
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa if you can kind of
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
get together and figure out
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
agree on language that would that would
 
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
be helpful represent representative
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
Scully as well um and then I guess we
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
can uh we'll figure on on on an
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
amendment being brought for that and uh
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
we can uh talk about that probably next
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
week before I'm I'm planning
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%

00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:24.760 align:start position:0%

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh we can have that Amendment ready and
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%

00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
hr10 oh oh that's right I'm looking at
 
00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:48.200 align:start position:0%
the public hearing hello yeah okay I'm
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%

00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.589 align:start position:0%
be looking at
hr13

00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
hr13
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
Y and
 
00:59:05.029 --> 00:59:05.039 align:start position:0%
hr13 thank you gentlemen for joining us
 
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
this morning and lending your uh your
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
input appreciate it
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
hr13 um which is a house resolution
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
opposing the permitting of a landfill
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
next to Forest Lake State Park in Dalton
 
00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:20.630 align:start position:0%
next to Forest Lake State Park in Dalton
New

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:26.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um so we heard that bill
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
house resolutions um questions comments
 
00:59:30.599 --> 00:59:32.109 align:start position:0%
house resolutions um questions comments
about

00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:32.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
that representative Bixby yeah so
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh the idea of um making
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
a statement opposing permitting landfill
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
next to uh Forest Lake State Park in
 
00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:51.640 align:start position:0%
Dalton is entirely consistent with uh
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
the legislative track record of this
 
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
committee for the last several terms uh
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
and uh it is also consistent with uh the
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
corner office position on this uh so far
 
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
as has been publicly stated uh I think
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
that in that I don't see a whole lot of
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
controversy on this uh we also need to
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that uh house resolutions
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
are really a statement of collective
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
opinion as opposed to any having any
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
sort of legal weight so um I think that
 
01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh it is a I think it's a good gesture I
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
don't think that uh and I'm I'm hoping
 
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
that we can get it to pass with a with a
 
01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
fair number of votes in the house um and
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
I think that typically when we assuming
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
that that we can pass this out of
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
committee unanimously which I would like
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
to see um we typically put that sort of
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
thing on the consent calendar in this
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
case I think it would make sense to
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
actually have a
 
01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.630 align:start position:0%
actually have a
brief

01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
brief
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
um a brief uh Speech from the well about
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
it uh just to um sort of let people know
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
what it is that the H let everyone in
 
01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
the house know what position what uh
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
statement is being
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
made representative
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you madam chair uh I'm
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
generally against resolutions just
 
01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:23.319 align:start position:0%
because they don't have teeth it's a
 
01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
waste of paper yada y y but the Dalton
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
landfill is one I think worth moving
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
forward on and I'll be voting for The
 
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
Resolution you know got John Swan right
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
here he's worked very hard on the Dalton
 
01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:40.039 align:start position:0%
landfill water Warriors that are up
 
01:01:41.789 --> 01:01:41.799 align:start position:0%
there that are urging the legislature to
 
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
do something about this and I think
 
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
making a short statement and I wouldn't
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
support this if it was just a statement
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
but because we have so many pieces of
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
legislation about landfills I think that
 
01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
it's important to make the statement and
 
01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
then also pass the legislation with
 
01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
teeth to make sure that that we have
 
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
clean safe environment in the state of
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire representative H Haskins
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just want to go
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
on record uh echoing my two previous
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues sentiments we've come a long
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
way on this issue and I think it's now
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
time for the legislature to say this is
 
01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
our position we've done the work now we
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
need to get it across the Finish Line in
 
01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
every way that we can thank you okay
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Miner
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair although the house
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
resolution really does have no teeth I
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
think it's an important statement that
 
01:02:35.549 --> 01:02:35.559 align:start position:0%
we all uh agree on that uh uh this um
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
house resolution should go through thank
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
STIs thank you madam chair um I just
 
01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
would like to make a public statement
 
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
about um my appreciation for um Mr Swan
 
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
for the work that he's done um
 
01:03:00.029 --> 01:03:00.039 align:start position:0%
because when we first started having the
 
01:03:04.109 --> 01:03:04.119 align:start position:0%
talk about Forest Lake many years ago it
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
was just a small group of people but now
 
01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:13.559 align:start position:0%
we have come to the point where
 
01:03:16.829 --> 01:03:16.839 align:start position:0%
um there are constituents up there and
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
they're asking us to act and by putting
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
out something like this that we can pass
 
01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully on the other side side of the
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
wall we can get it through and um with
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
the governor having um made a public
 
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
statement about it I'm hopeful that this
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
is the year thank you representative
 
01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
Freeman and then representative Scully
 
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you Madame chair um I'm I'm not
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
going to make a statement because th
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
this is really a no-brainer to vote for
 
01:03:51.069 --> 01:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
this resolution but I'm just curious on
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
when we as a committee and and and a
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
body feel that we should get a bill to
 
01:03:59.630 --> 01:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
make this really solidify this and
 
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
codify this into law and I think that's
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
what we should be working on after we
 
01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:06.039 align:start position:0%
passed this house
 
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
resolution representative Scully and
 
01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:08.950 align:start position:0%
resolution representative Scully and
then

01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you
 
01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm in support of the spirit of this
 
01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
um I think that from my perspective when
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
I you create a house resolution it
 
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
should be something that is short and
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
piy and can be read from the well and I
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
think this is so long and unwieldly that
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
you really can't do it so if the
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
intention was to actually speak to the
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
body and have them uh agree with the
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
sentiment I I would just suggest that
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
this be drastically shortened U to get
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
to the point so that we could read it
 
01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
from the floor and then people could um
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
agree with it representative
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
Penza good morning morning I'd like to
 
01:04:54.029 --> 01:04:54.039 align:start position:0%
um just respond to representative
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
Freeman's statement we have lots of
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
bills in right now and we are going to
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
hear one this afternoon that will
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
um that would stop uh a landfill in its
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
tracks um being built in poor soil so
 
01:05:11.549 --> 01:05:11.559 align:start position:0%
but the other piece that is huge for
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
This Is Us passing a
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
moratorium um a pause I hate the word
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
moratorium um but a pause basically so
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
then we can work with the agency um get
 
01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
good legisl on the um legislative pieces
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
on the books and move forward from that
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
so I support this resolution um I
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from I
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
kind of heard that um at the end of the
 
01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
last hearing from representative Scully
 
01:05:42.269 --> 01:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that we're going to read
 
01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
the whole resolution on the house floor
 
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
um there's so much backstory people have
 
01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
been fighting on this for um I think
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
we're going into our sixth year um we
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
need to do this for the people
 
01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.990 align:start position:0%
need to do this for the people
representative

01:05:58.990 --> 01:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:02.109 --> 01:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and I'd like
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
to just Echo what um representative
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
Skully also stated but this doesn't just
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
there's more wording in this resolution
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
than just the Dalton landfill um so if
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
the idea was
 
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
to you know prevent the Dalton landfill
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
next to Forest Lake State Park that's
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
one thing but there is a lot of wording
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
in this resolution that is outside of
 
01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
that scope and I don't think
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
um with that and good conscious I could
 
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
vote for the resolution as it
 
01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
stands representative
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um I wanted
 
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
to reiterate what uh representative
 
01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
Scully said I wonder if instead of
 
01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
reading the whole resolution if there
 
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
isn't a a Artful way to summarize it
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
without having to rewrite the whole
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
thing because it is very long and I and
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
I think we would lose people if if we
 
01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
were to stand up there and read directly
 
01:06:59.829 --> 01:06:59.839 align:start position:0%
by wrote from the from the page
 
01:06:59.839 --> 01:07:01.670 align:start position:0%
by wrote from the from the page
representative

01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
guber um thank you chair uh I fully
 
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
support this uh resolution um I think
 
01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature needs to take a strong
 
01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
stand with over the years of people
 
01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
looking at what's happening and and the
 
01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
and the mission of this uh committee
 
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
itself U yes I believe it is too long to
 
01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
read um but and maybe that could be
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
modified but I I strongly support it
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so um
 
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
first uh three pages of the resolution
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
are essentially citing all of the
 
01:07:40.029 --> 01:07:40.039 align:start position:0%
existing or or many of the existing uh
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
positions that the state of New
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has about a number of things
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
having to do with Environmental
 
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
Protection and safeguards for our
 
01:07:51.789 --> 01:07:51.799 align:start position:0%
natural environment uh the Crux of the
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
resolution is basically just what is on
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
page four which is one sentence uh that
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
the general court resolves to protect
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
the interest of the state and the
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
citizens by asking the New Hampshire
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
Department of environment and services
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
the governor the Attorney General to
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
take all appropriate legal actions
 
01:08:09.789 --> 01:08:09.799 align:start position:0%
against permitting a Le landfill next to
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake State Park in Dalton that is
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
all we need to read from the so if we
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
read that from the well and we preface
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
that by saying that the bulk of the
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
resolution is just providing all of the
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
background in state policy that supports
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
it uh I think that's a less than one
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%
minute well speech at the
 
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair so I'm glad to
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
hear it seems that we've got consensus
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
behind the resolution if it if it could
 
01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
be shorter um I don't I don't think that
 
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
it takes anything away from the part
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
that representative Bixby just read if
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
if it were shortened but uh I just
 
01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to say in terms of what a
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
resolution can can do a resolution that
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
has no teeth um is that I think this
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
committee has been
 
01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
particularly good uh in my time here at
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
leading the house and demonstrating
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
bipartisanship and we have on all of
 
01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
these kind of landfill bills and and I
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
think that's one of the great virtues of
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
a house resolution if we can pass this
 
01:09:17.309 --> 01:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
with significant bipartisan numbers I
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
think that adds to the strength of this
 
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
statement as a statement to our
 
01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
constituents that it is a case in in
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
times where we have a lot of partis and
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
Fishers in the state that this is a real
 
01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan resolution so I I think that
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
is the value of a house resolution even
 
01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
when it has no application in law okay
 
01:09:37.239 --> 01:09:38.229 align:start position:0%
when it has no application in law okay
thank

01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:09:44.110 --> 01:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
you okay so here's where I am with this
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
um so where I am with this is I I
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
certainly would not like to see a
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
landfill uh permitted next to Forest
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
Lake State
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
Park I I I don't I think that's the
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
wrong place for that kind of
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
facility my problem is the same as what
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler had said is that
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
in general I I don't like to vote for
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
these house resolutions because at the
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
end of the day I don't really feel that
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
they do anything I mean it's okay you
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
might argue that it's a statement from
 
01:10:25.709 --> 01:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
the body um but there really is no
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
I the the what where where the where it
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
really matters is the policies that this
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
committee adopts as well as you know
 
01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
the the other side of the wall if they
 
01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
go along with it as well but I also I
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
mean I understand the governor's made a
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
position on this but as an executive in
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
the executive branch um they can only
 
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
follow what
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
the law says what statute says it's not
 
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
like she she can say well there will
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
never be a uh a landfill in any
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
particular place I don't care where it
 
01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
is what depends on that is what the
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
rules are and what statutes dictates and
 
01:11:15.679 --> 01:11:16.790 align:start position:0%
rules are and what statutes dictates and
where

01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
Dees uh follows the law and statute and
 
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
rules and then determines whether or not
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
a place is an appropriate place for a
 
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
landfill so my problem one of my
 
01:11:33.709 --> 01:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
problems with this is that um the
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
statement that the general court
 
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
resolves to protect the interests of the
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
state and its citizens by asking New
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
Services the governor and the Attorney
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
General to take all appropriate legal
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
actions that phrase all appropriate
 
01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.030 align:start position:0%
actions that phrase all appropriate
legal

01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
legal
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
actions I don't know what that means
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
other than following statute and
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
following the law um I don't know that
 
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
they can just dream up some
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
other uh way around or a loophole or
 
01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
whatever but I I don't I don't I have a
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
problem with that particular line and I
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe somebody can help me
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
out with
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
that as I said I support the fact that I
 
01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to see a landfill there but
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just really hesitant with the
 
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
wording in this house resolution
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so um if I
 
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly the the phrase
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
legal actions can be interpreted in a
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
couple of different ways one is if
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
you're taking legal action it sounds
 
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
like you're suing somebody right the
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
other is that an action could be legal
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
which means consistent with all of the
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
laws and having that in having that
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
ambiguous phrase in the core of the Crux
 
01:12:57.149 --> 01:12:57.159 align:start position:0%
of the resolution is problematic so
 
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
maybe we can rephrase it
 
01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that what we are asking
 
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
for is them to take all actions that are
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh consistent with uh with current
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
law okay uh and and that's not the
 
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
phrase that I would I don't think that
 
01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
is is the perfect phrase either I don't
 
01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
think that that word smithing by
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
committee is a good idea right but but
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
the the Gen the the gist is that we want
 
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're not talking
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
about suing we're talking about uh
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
making sure that asking them to take
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
actions that are within the scope of
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
their legal
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
parameters but at the same time if I may
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
I know other people have some comments
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
but at the same time you know I think it
 
01:13:49.629 --> 01:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
this doesn't just apply any of the laws
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
the policies that we've adopted the
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
rules that Dees has adopted uh does not
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
just is not just apply to Forest Lake it
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
applies to any place where um it is
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to to permit a
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
landfill and I wanted to be clear about
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
that representative kto representative
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
um Howard after thank you madam
 
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
chair so my question is are we not
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
following current
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
statement representative Howard thank
 
01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I think we need to
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
ponder the very real possibility that
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
this resolution will not pass through
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
the body of the house and that that
 
01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
given the current temperature of of our
 
01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
of that very body it could it could very
 
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
well fail and and what kind of statement
 
01:14:48.629 --> 01:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
would that make so I you know I think
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
that if if we have any concerns or
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
doubts that um we should really me
 
01:14:58.270 --> 01:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
measure take a measure of that
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
risk representative King I just want to
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
Second what representative Howard just
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
said I was going to wait until the very
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
end but yeah I think that is a real
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
possibility that we could we could get
 
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
it on consent calendar here and then
 
01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
shoot ourselves in the foot by not
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
putting it on consent calendar and even
 
01:15:15.149 --> 01:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
if it does pass the house if it passes
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
by like three votes that's like w w it
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
would have been better it would have
 
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
been better just to put it on the
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
consent Calendar use it as a as a media
 
01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
blitz hey we got on the consent or pass
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
the house in a bipartisan manner but it
 
01:15:29.629 --> 01:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
but but it could very easily not be a
 
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
bipartisan deal when it goes to the full
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
house floor and that's going to be
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
embarrassing in my
 
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
opinion questions representative H
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair this
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
resolution for me as with all things I
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
will vote my conscience if I voted the
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
way I thought the house might go or the
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
Senate might go perhaps I would vote
 
01:15:54.629 --> 01:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
differently but I don't consider that in
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
my votes of conscience this is about the
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
landfill in
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
Dalton um I think as was said better
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
than I can by both reps Bixby and ger
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
this is a statement of where we are as a
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
legislative body I think it's an
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
important one and I would like to see us
 
01:16:18.430 --> 01:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
pass it the idea of it going on
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
consent um is an interesting one if you
 
01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
if we feel that it won't be
 
01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
successful um perhaps consent is the
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
best way to go thank
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam Madam chair um I
 
01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to thank you as well as
 
01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
representative quanta because I was very
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
ready to vote for this but you brought
 
01:16:47.629 --> 01:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
up some very compelling points about
 
01:16:49.629 --> 01:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
this house resolution and and again I
 
01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
think this is why the legislature needs
 
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
to be very um
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
we need we need to be very careful on
 
01:16:59.229 --> 01:16:59.239 align:start position:0%
when we put house resolutions in and how
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
we put them in because it's not meant to
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
usurp any law that our rule we may put
 
01:17:07.149 --> 01:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
in it's it's meant to make an
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
announcement and I just I'm not feeling
 
01:17:12.430 --> 01:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable with voting for this after
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
the points that um yourself and um Vice
 
01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
chair coma brought up not because I
 
01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
don't want this to happen but because it
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
it is a concern I mean a house
 
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
resolution most people would not look at
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
that as a house resolution they would
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
look at that as a law so I I think we
 
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
need to be very careful on how we word
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
these things and how we proceed forward
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
with it um I appreciate the sentiment
 
01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
that all have expressed here about it
 
01:17:42.669 --> 01:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
and I as well do not want to see
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
anything happen um with that landfill
 
01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
but I just think we need to be a little
 
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
a little I can't talk I have cold
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
medicine in me I'm so sorry I I think we
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
just need to be um a little more choosy
 
01:17:57.070 --> 01:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
about the words that we put in a
 
01:17:58.830 --> 01:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
resolution like
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
this representative King and then ger I
 
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
not the sponsor of the bill I'm only a
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor but I personally would be
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
totally amenable to reducing the size
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
and scope of the resolution in order to
 
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
be amendable to everybody in here
 
01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
because I also agree that sometimes you
 
01:18:18.629 --> 01:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
might have a really good resolution and
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
you put too much uh flimflam in there
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
and it just is like a poison pill so I I
 
01:18:27.149 --> 01:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
I like the idea of everybody being on
 
01:18:29.229 --> 01:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
board with this resolution and being
 
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
happy about it representative ger thank
 
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
you madam chair so I just want to
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
address the the the phrase in question
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
here about take all appropriate legal
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
actions because I think that does raise
 
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
questions uh as I read that what that
 
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
means is to use all of the legal power
 
01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
all of the powers at your disposal right
 
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
so we're urging the governor the
 
01:18:51.790 --> 01:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
Attorney General etc etc to use all of
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
the powers at their disposal it's not an
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
implication that they are not enforcing
 
01:18:59.310 --> 01:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
current law but it is to again use all
 
01:19:02.189 --> 01:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
of the powers uh that they have at their
 
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
disposal and I don't know in terms of
 
01:19:07.229 --> 01:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
wording uh representative Bixby was
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting the the idea you know if we
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
say something to the extent of take all
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate actions consistent with
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
existing statute I mean that's different
 
01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
from legal actions which could have the
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
implication of lawsuits Etc but I think
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
that's the meaning of it to take actions
 
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
consistent with the existing statute
 
01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
that are again at the disposal of these
 
01:19:27.639 --> 01:19:31.110 align:start position:0%
that are again at the disposal of these
various

01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
agents representative
 
01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
wheeler just to follow up on what
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
representative King said I I wonder you
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
know with the uh Amendment to the legal
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
action language that you just brought up
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
which I support could we not just have
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
this uh lines one through six on page
 
01:19:51.149 --> 01:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
four be the
 
01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:53.639 align:start position:0%
resolution with the changes of the legal
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:58.570 align:start position:0%
um you're asking
 
01:19:58.570 --> 01:20:01.270 align:start position:0%
um you're asking
[Laughter]

01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
me I mean I I understand that there's a
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
reason for some wear asses I I'm sure
 
01:20:08.669 --> 01:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
many of the wear asses would be approved
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
by everybody here but if there's a few
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
whereases that are unacceptable then you
 
01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
know I have no problem getting rid of
 
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
those personally but I I I'm not going
 
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
to I'm not going to hijack this bill so
 
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah um I am
 
01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
worried that we're about to launch into
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
trying to write this by committee right
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
here uh because we're getting into sort
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
of the details of wording which is much
 
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
more uh the task of a subcommittee and I
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
was wondering if representative king
 
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
would be willing to uh take on uh a
 
01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
drastic reduction of the size of this uh
 
01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
um uh resolution uh in uh the solid way
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I'd be fine with that yep
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
okay that sounds like a plan appreciate
 
01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
that uh anything else that uh we would
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
like to discuss in this work session
 
01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:14.709 align:start position:0%
like to discuss in this work session
um

01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
anybody yeah um
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
so as we have planned this
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
morning let's see I have planned this
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
morning that uh we are going
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
to uh exec two bills
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
hb21 which is the um prohibiting the
 
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
removal of Claws from cats and HB 240
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
removing the penalty of forfeiture for
 
01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
non-payment of dog
 
01:21:47.709 --> 01:21:47.719 align:start position:0%
licenses and um so between now which
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
we've kind of finished uh discussing
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
some of the legislation uh that is
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
before us bills that we have heard in
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee already um we'll take uh take
 
01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
a break and I think uh it is appropriate
 
01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
for um both of our sides to uh take some
 
01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
time to caucus prior to um our exec
 
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
sessions and um so I guess we can plan
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
on coming back here at
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%

01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%

the removal of cloths from cats and I
 
02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
move itl on this um Bill Madame chair
 
02:22:55.990 --> 02:22:56.000 align:start position:0%

02:22:58.670 --> 02:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa and I will speak to
 
02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:01.750 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa and I will speak to
my

02:23:01.750 --> 02:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
motion I find this HB 240 um to be a
 
02:23:09.630 --> 02:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
bill which uh removes the autonomy of
 
02:23:11.630 --> 02:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
our veterinarians and then dictates to
 
02:23:14.590 --> 02:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
them what procedures they can and can't
 
02:23:19.150 --> 02:23:19.160 align:start position:0%
do uh I also see that uh based on
 
02:23:25.150 --> 02:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh deying of cats is um
 
02:23:27.870 --> 02:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
not a procedure
 
02:23:31.510 --> 02:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
that is done in New Hampshire uh by
 
02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
practice most people when they come to a
 
02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and they uh request this
 
02:23:41.110 --> 02:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
kind of procedure the veterinarian will
 
02:23:44.750 --> 02:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh counsel them and talk to them about
 
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
not doing this and what other behavior
 
02:23:50.670 --> 02:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
modification techniques can be used um
 
02:23:53.230 --> 02:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
and they they have a conversation about
 
02:23:55.950 --> 02:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
why this is a procedure procedure that
 
02:23:59.230 --> 02:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be done uh I am not convinced
 
02:24:01.550 --> 02:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
that this is a problem in New
 
02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am seeing um many of these
 
02:24:08.349 --> 02:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
kinds of bills being introduced all
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
across the country to see um where it
 
02:24:14.230 --> 02:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
can get passed where it can't get
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
passed and um I I think this
 
02:24:21.670 --> 02:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
is um
 
02:24:23.830 --> 02:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
a solution looking for a problem we
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem in New Hampshire
 
02:24:30.030 --> 02:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
and I I just don't believe that this is
 
02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
um an appropriate piece of
 
02:24:35.910 --> 02:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
legislation uh I I think it it creates
 
02:24:39.950 --> 02:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
overreach into uh the work that our
 
02:24:42.830 --> 02:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
trusted veterinarians do we heard
 
02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
testimony from uh veterinarians who
 
02:24:49.510 --> 02:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarian who said that uh it's not a
 
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
practice that that most veterinarians do
 
02:24:55.349 --> 02:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
in this state uh it is it is a practice
 
02:24:59.190 --> 02:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
that has fallen out of um out of
 
02:25:02.110 --> 02:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
practice uh used to see a lot more of
 
02:25:05.550 --> 02:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
this in the 1970s 80s 90s you don't see
 
02:25:09.870 --> 02:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
it uh hardly anymore and I I don't
 
02:25:13.030 --> 02:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
believe that uh this is uh something
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
statute that a legislation that uh we
 
02:25:16.399 --> 02:25:17.870 align:start position:0%
statute that a legislation that uh we
need

02:25:17.870 --> 02:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
to have uh put put into into law so with
 
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
that I I am uh very opposed to uh this
 
02:25:28.910 --> 02:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank
 
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby yes
 
02:25:35.670 --> 02:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
so uh we heard testimony that suggests
 
02:25:38.750 --> 02:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
that in fact this is uh even though this
 
02:25:42.030 --> 02:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
is not uh an incredibly common practice
 
02:25:45.429 --> 02:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
it is a practice that still exists and
 
02:25:49.630 --> 02:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
uh that it is a practice that is uh not
 
02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
good for the
 
02:25:57.510 --> 02:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
and uh I think that um even if uh 95% of
 
02:26:01.349 --> 02:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
veterinarians do this uh rarely if NE or
 
02:26:04.870 --> 02:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
or never uh there there might be a small
 
02:26:07.950 --> 02:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
percentage of who still do it and don't
 
02:26:10.429 --> 02:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
follow the advice of their National
 
02:26:12.590 --> 02:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
organizations uh only about a third of
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
the vets in New Hampshire are members of
 
02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
the uh New Hampshire veterinarian
 
02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
Medical Association uh so um I I think
 
02:26:23.070 --> 02:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
this is something where we do need to um
 
02:26:25.349 --> 02:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
provide a little bit of statutory
 
02:26:27.990 --> 02:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
guidance uh for the profession so that
 
02:26:30.910 --> 02:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
they do follow what uh their profession
 
02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
generally says is the best idea uh we
 
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
however it was uh there need to be some
 
02:26:39.870 --> 02:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
exceptions for the health of the cat and
 
02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
also uh for potentially for the health
 
02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
of cat owners what we have an amendment
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
that uh brings in that provides that um
 
02:26:52.910 --> 02:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
that except the possibility of an except
 
02:26:55.269 --> 02:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
exception if a cat owner needs to have
 
02:26:58.150 --> 02:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
their cat declawed for medical reasons
 
02:27:01.070 --> 02:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh and we'd like to have a chance to
 
02:27:04.030 --> 02:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
have that Amendment heard uh so in order
 
02:27:05.790 --> 02:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
to hear that Amendment we need to turn
 
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
vote down the itl so please I'm urging
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
that folks vote no on the
 
02:27:15.830 --> 02:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
itl any other comments representative
 
02:27:20.670 --> 02:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
comp no I I thought I saw your hand okay
 
02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:22.150 align:start position:0%
comp no I I thought I saw your hand okay
um

02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:25.950 --> 02:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
well again I would I would say that um
 
02:27:28.349 --> 02:27:28.359 align:start position:0%
either lawmakers trust our veterinarians
 
02:27:30.630 --> 02:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
to act ethically and in the best
 
02:27:33.630 --> 02:27:33.640 align:start position:0%
interest of animals and their um and
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
their owners or we do not and um I just
 
02:27:41.269 --> 02:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
I just feel that we should itl this bill
 
02:27:43.950 --> 02:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
so uh with that if there's no further
 
02:27:47.309 --> 02:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
discussion I would uh ask the clerk to
 
02:27:55.150 --> 02:27:55.160 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair I'll keep it very
 
02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
very brief this bill which is or this
 
02:29:29.230 --> 02:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
amendment which is product of bipartisan
 
02:29:30.389 --> 02:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
collaboration I want to thank
 
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative Penza for doing the
 
02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
research that went into the bill uh it
 
02:29:36.429 --> 02:29:36.439 align:start position:0%
does two things it Narrows the scope of
 
02:29:38.750 --> 02:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
the procedure we're talking about so we
 
02:29:41.469 --> 02:29:41.479 align:start position:0%
are being very specific about the
 
02:29:43.630 --> 02:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
procedure the procedure of removing the
 
02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
claw at that first knuckle right so it's
 
02:29:48.590 --> 02:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
a very specific procedure uh and I would
 
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
also point out uh on the second page of
 
02:29:53.590 --> 02:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
the bill um just personally I would say
 
02:29:54.830 --> 02:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
that there's there's one part of the
 
02:29:58.510 --> 02:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
bill I'm not frankly comfortable with uh
 
02:30:02.190 --> 02:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
and that is the uh section B at line 11
 
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
which provides an exception if the cats
 
02:30:06.030 --> 02:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
Clause POS a significant health risk to
 
02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
the owner uh the CDC has said that uh
 
02:30:10.630 --> 02:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
they don't recommend declawing of cats
 
02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
in that case a reason why I bring that
 
02:30:16.309 --> 02:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
up is because uh this is a bipartisan
 
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
effort to reach a compromise that is
 
02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
designed to to make the bill as
 
02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
acceptable to as many members as
 
02:30:26.309 --> 02:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
possible so uh in that Spirit uh I hope
 
02:30:30.110 --> 02:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
that we can adopt this amendment to the
 
02:30:33.230 --> 02:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
bill okay I would like to speak against
 
02:30:36.910 --> 02:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment for the following reasons
 
02:30:39.910 --> 02:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that um penalties were removed
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
makes this toothless there is no reason
 
02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
why you know if somebody does a cat de
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
claw there's no penalty for it so it
 
02:30:52.230 --> 02:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
becomes kind of meaningless at all and
 
02:30:55.790 --> 02:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that um we
 
02:30:59.630 --> 02:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
are saying that you can only do a cat
 
02:31:03.070 --> 02:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
declaw if it's for you know the health
 
02:31:06.510 --> 02:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
and the benefit of the cat or for the
 
02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
health and benefit of the owner who may
 
02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
be on blood thinners or whatever um our
 
02:31:16.150 --> 02:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
veterinarians already do this and if we
 
02:31:20.790 --> 02:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
are in this bill already saying that um
 
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
um the general court affirms our trust
 
02:31:26.030 --> 02:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
and licensed New Hampshire veterinarians
 
02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
expertise compassion and ethical
 
02:31:29.830 --> 02:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
judgment to make decisions in the best
 
02:31:32.070 --> 02:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
interest of the animals under their
 
02:31:35.910 --> 02:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
care well we're not doing that if we're
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
telling them we're we're Banning
 
02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
procedures from them and you know they
 
02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
already do this this this is uh
 
02:31:48.910 --> 02:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessary legislation because we
 
02:31:50.670 --> 02:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
already do this
 
02:31:53.349 --> 02:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
and that's um why I'll be voting no
 
02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
against this
 
02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:03.429 --> 02:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none I guess I'll call
 
02:32:07.590 --> 02:32:07.600 align:start position:0%

03:35:20.550 --> 03:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
so representative parel welcome to
 
03:35:22.950 --> 03:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
environment Agriculture and you have a
 
03:35:25.670 --> 03:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
bill for us establishing a committee to
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
study the use and problems associated
 
03:35:29.309 --> 03:35:29.319 align:start position:0%
with regulating the distribution and
 
03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
disposal of certain Solid Waste within
 
03:35:35.030 --> 03:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
landfills and transfer centers so I'm
 
03:35:37.349 --> 03:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
here to produce House Bill 479 which
 
03:35:38.990 --> 03:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
will establish a committee to study the
 
03:35:40.950 --> 03:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
use and problems associated with
 
03:35:43.510 --> 03:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
regulating and distribution and disposal
 
03:35:47.229 --> 03:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
of certain solid ways specifically carry
 
03:35:49.590 --> 03:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
out single use plastic bags as provided
 
03:35:52.070 --> 03:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
by many retail outlets that's the actual
 
03:35:54.550 --> 03:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
focus of the bill plastic bags are used
 
03:35:56.389 --> 03:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
for an average of 12 minutes but a
 
03:35:59.030 --> 03:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
single plastic bag has a life expectancy
 
03:36:02.550 --> 03:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
of up to a thousand years now while I'm
 
03:36:03.950 --> 03:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
unable to locate a figure for the number
 
03:36:06.389 --> 03:36:06.399 align:start position:0%
of bags used in New Hampshire Americans
 
03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
use more than 100 billion plastic bags
 
03:36:11.670 --> 03:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
each year more than 300 bags per person
 
03:36:14.189 --> 03:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
per year one could extrapolate that with
 
03:36:16.389 --> 03:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
a population of 1.4 million ion New
 
03:36:19.590 --> 03:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uses 4.2 million bags per year
 
03:36:21.110 --> 03:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of lost resources to
 
03:36:23.550 --> 03:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturer one 100 billion plastic
 
03:36:27.150 --> 03:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
bags it requires 12 million barrels of
 
03:36:29.870 --> 03:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
oil that's 12 million barel barrels of
 
03:36:31.870 --> 03:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
oil unavailable for heating or at the
 
03:36:34.950 --> 03:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
pump and this is one of things that
 
03:36:36.870 --> 03:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
obviously drives
 
03:36:38.870 --> 03:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
inflation now it's generally subn
 
03:36:40.189 --> 03:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge that these single use carry
 
03:36:42.630 --> 03:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
out bags are not food grade uh most of
 
03:36:44.349 --> 03:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
us know that we can't put our uh
 
03:36:46.070 --> 03:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
leftover turkey
 
03:36:48.790 --> 03:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
in these bags most of us know that
 
03:36:50.110 --> 03:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
wrapping food directly in these bags
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
allow the chemical leeching of any
 
03:36:54.150 --> 03:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
number of high-risk Plastics and we
 
03:36:55.750 --> 03:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
still suffer landfills with these
 
03:36:57.429 --> 03:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
short-term Plastics that invariably
 
03:37:00.349 --> 03:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
leech into our water supply if they make
 
03:37:02.510 --> 03:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
it to the landfill at all we can no
 
03:37:05.870 --> 03:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
longer otherwise we all live
 
03:37:08.510 --> 03:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
Downstream report on the adverse health
 
03:37:10.309 --> 03:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
effects of plastic by the Ecology Center
 
03:37:12.550 --> 03:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
finds that Plastics typically used in
 
03:37:14.349 --> 03:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
bottles bags and food containers contain
 
03:37:16.550 --> 03:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
chemical additives such as endocrine
 
03:37:18.469 --> 03:37:18.479 align:start position:0%

suppression in humans and
 
03:37:26.670 --> 03:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
wildli it takes a thousand years for a
 
03:37:29.590 --> 03:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
plastic bag to degrade into a landfill
 
03:37:31.229 --> 03:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the bags don't break down
 
03:37:33.750 --> 03:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
completely but instead photodegrade
 
03:37:36.030 --> 03:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
becoming microplastics that absorb Toxin
 
03:37:38.110 --> 03:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
and continue to pollute the environment
 
03:37:40.070 --> 03:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
this according to a 2020 ACS
 
03:37:42.590 --> 03:37:42.600 align:start position:0%

03:37:44.150 --> 03:37:44.160 align:start position:0%

environment um
 
03:37:48.790 --> 03:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
and since Lee hates are uh rightfully
 
03:37:51.550 --> 03:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
caught our interest a 2019 paper

plastic bags the most common found of
 
03:38:31.990 --> 03:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
lit of most common form of litter found
 
03:38:34.429 --> 03:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
in the ocean these plastic bags break
 
03:38:36.990 --> 03:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
down small Plankton siiz particles that
 
03:38:40.150 --> 03:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
can outnumber Plankton 6 to1 and these
 
03:38:42.309 --> 03:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
particles collect toxins like pcbs and
 
03:38:44.910 --> 03:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
DDT at levels up to a million times the
 
03:38:46.349 --> 03:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
level found in and
 
03:38:48.389 --> 03:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
seawater now we'll be hearing further
 
03:38:49.469 --> 03:38:49.479 align:start position:0%
testimony you can elaborate the
 
03:38:51.910 --> 03:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
environmental Lisk even greater detail
 
03:38:53.469 --> 03:38:53.479 align:start position:0%
and if you would like a copy of the
 
03:38:55.229 --> 03:38:55.239 align:start position:0%
links that are underlined in electronic
 
03:38:57.630 --> 03:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
form I should add this also I'll be glad
 
03:39:00.870 --> 03:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
to share an electronic uh version of My
 
03:39:02.630 --> 03:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
Testimony where you can actually the
 
03:39:04.670 --> 03:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
links are active I'll make sure to do
 
03:39:06.389 --> 03:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
that yes we would like that copy thank
 
03:39:08.429 --> 03:39:08.439 align:start position:0%
you could I just send that to you for
 
03:39:10.229 --> 03:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
distribution huh could I send it to you
 
03:39:13.510 --> 03:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
for distribution you may but uh the copy
 
03:39:15.030 --> 03:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
that you have you can give to the clerk
 
03:39:16.429 --> 03:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
today if you
 
03:39:19.110 --> 03:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
like oh okay okay I would say that you I
 
03:39:20.550 --> 03:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
I would give you an electronic copy
 
03:39:22.510 --> 03:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
where you can actually click on the link
 
03:39:25.590 --> 03:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
and okay I'll send to the committee okay
 
03:39:28.389 --> 03:39:28.399 align:start position:0%
good enough we'll see if that works okay
 
03:39:30.469 --> 03:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
um we'll be hearing further testimony
 
03:39:31.830 --> 03:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
that can elaborate the environmental
 
03:39:33.389 --> 03:39:33.399 align:start position:0%
risk to even greater detail but I
 
03:39:34.790 --> 03:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
believe most of us recognize the health
 
03:39:38.910 --> 03:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
threats if not specific details now why
 
03:39:40.670 --> 03:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
am I asking for a study committee when
 
03:39:42.150 --> 03:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
for one there's nothing to prevent me
 
03:39:44.710 --> 03:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
from drafting legislation and two we
 
03:39:46.229 --> 03:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
know that study committees are not in
 
03:39:47.710 --> 03:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
favor of the current house
 
03:39:49.710 --> 03:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
leadership I have seen successful
 
03:39:51.389 --> 03:39:51.399 align:start position:0%
legislation in all the other New England
 
03:39:53.550 --> 03:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
states while New Hampshire languishes on
 
03:39:55.550 --> 03:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
the back there's a map of uh which
 
03:39:57.309 --> 03:39:57.319 align:start position:0%
states have passed bag
 
03:39:57.319 --> 03:39:59.870 align:start position:0%
states have passed bag
bands

03:39:59.870 --> 03:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
bands
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
um more than a good
 
03:40:06.510 --> 03:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
bill we what we really need address is
 
03:40:08.070 --> 03:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
legislation that will find its way to
 
03:40:10.110 --> 03:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
the Senate and to the governor's desk we
 
03:40:13.750 --> 03:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
need cons consensus on this as we had in
 
03:40:16.389 --> 03:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
2019 uh a study committee even Limited
 
03:40:17.670 --> 03:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
in scope will be better prepared to
 
03:40:20.110 --> 03:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
create such legislation than any one
 
03:40:22.030 --> 03:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
legislator and I'm aware it's not a
 
03:40:23.550 --> 03:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
popular time yes word study committee I
 
03:40:24.710 --> 03:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
will ask for the sake of all New
 
03:40:26.429 --> 03:40:26.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens that cherish our
 
03:40:27.910 --> 03:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
precious environment to break with
 
03:40:30.030 --> 03:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
procedure and Grant this request and I
 
03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank for your time and I will answer
 
03:40:34.229 --> 03:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you representative
 
03:40:36.870 --> 03:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
parall any questions from the committee
 
03:40:36.880 --> 03:40:38.030 align:start position:0%
parall any questions from the committee
representative

03:40:38.030 --> 03:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:40:40.349 --> 03:40:40.359 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:40:42.189 --> 03:40:42.199 align:start position:0%
representative for being here today and
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
presenting this um why do we need to
 
03:40:47.150 --> 03:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
establish Lish this particular committee
 
03:40:49.150 --> 03:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
when we have the solid waste working
 
03:40:51.710 --> 03:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
group because to my knowledge and I I
 
03:40:53.790 --> 03:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
will gladly be corrected but to my
 
03:40:55.630 --> 03:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
knowledge Solid Waste working group is
 
03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
not uh working on originating any
 
03:41:00.510 --> 03:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
legislation around a single use plastic
 
03:41:02.670 --> 03:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
bag ban at this
 
03:41:04.870 --> 03:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
time I would I would I would love to be
 
03:41:06.870 --> 03:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
corrected if I'm wrong uh it is
 
03:41:09.349 --> 03:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
something that we are looking into uh we
 
03:41:13.349 --> 03:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
have been if I may um follow up on that
 
03:41:16.910 --> 03:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
I we are looking at uh Plastics
 
03:41:21.510 --> 03:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
recycling plastic bands uh anything to
 
03:41:24.149 --> 03:41:24.159 align:start position:0%
keep things out of landfills that's our
 
03:41:27.670 --> 03:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
charge is a landfill reduction uh we
 
03:41:32.070 --> 03:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
have goals which we are working on uh
 
03:41:34.870 --> 03:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know to in terms of you know what
 
03:41:37.670 --> 03:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
kinds of legislation we have been
 
03:41:40.189 --> 03:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
interviewing uh various people from
 
03:41:42.830 --> 03:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
various organizations in other states
 
03:41:44.550 --> 03:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
and how they handle these different
 
03:41:44.560 --> 03:41:45.870 align:start position:0%
and how they handle these different
things

03:41:45.870 --> 03:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:41:49.590 --> 03:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
um so plastic bags is is uh something
 
03:41:51.870 --> 03:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
that we're we have on our plate that
 
03:41:54.309 --> 03:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
we're looking at as well as you know
 
03:41:56.950 --> 03:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
mattresses textiles all these different
 
03:41:59.950 --> 03:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of things so um it
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
is uh in our in our window of things
 
03:42:06.990 --> 03:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
that we are wanting to work
 
03:42:11.110 --> 03:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
on um but what I what I am seeing here
 
03:42:15.189 --> 03:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
in particular is that um you're not see
 
03:42:19.349 --> 03:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
seeking to examine Plastics per se you
 
03:42:21.710 --> 03:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
just mentioned certain Solid Waste
 
03:42:25.070 --> 03:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
within landfills and transfer centers
 
03:42:28.189 --> 03:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
so you know in terms of a if you really
 
03:42:30.510 --> 03:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
want to do a committee to study
 
03:42:33.429 --> 03:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
specifically Plastics I I would imagine
 
03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
that that's something that would need to
 
03:42:38.790 --> 03:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
be refined yes could I add that my
 
03:42:44.630 --> 03:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
original um my original uh uh bill sent
 
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
out uh language sent to LCR did not talk
 
03:42:50.309 --> 03:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
about the distribution and disposal of
 
03:42:52.950 --> 03:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
certain solid ways I did say single use
 
03:42:54.950 --> 03:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
plastic bags is provided by many retail
 
03:42:57.710 --> 03:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
outlets that's what I sent in okay and
 
03:42:59.070 --> 03:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh they seem to be insistent that they
 
03:43:00.790 --> 03:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
didn't want to use that terminology I'm
 
03:43:03.429 --> 03:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
very sorry they didn't um May I turn
 
03:43:06.149 --> 03:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
this around and ask a question
 
03:43:09.550 --> 03:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
of me yes sure go right ahead okay sure
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
Ian a friendly question no no no no okay
 
03:43:15.910 --> 03:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
even if it's unfriendly I'm good
 
03:43:17.990 --> 03:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's friendly here for the same reason
 
03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
you know um but um do you think that
 
03:43:26.349 --> 03:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
something like this a plastic bag ban we
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
had we almost I wasn't here in 2019 but
 
03:43:30.590 --> 03:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
I understand that we were very very
 
03:43:32.710 --> 03:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
close to getting this ban and the rest
 
03:43:34.349 --> 03:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
of our Northeast has already taken the
 
03:43:37.189 --> 03:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
step we're lagging behind we have a real
 
03:43:38.630 --> 03:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
problem here do you think it might help
 
03:43:40.870 --> 03:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
alleviate the important work that the
 
03:43:44.349 --> 03:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
swag does if we were to set this up as a
 
03:43:46.189 --> 03:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
separate committee possibly yeah I don't
 
03:43:48.469 --> 03:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
know I mean I and that's something I
 
03:43:50.229 --> 03:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
think I probably want to discuss with
 
03:43:53.550 --> 03:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
representative eel MH and see you know
 
03:43:56.910 --> 03:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh priority what what the
 
03:43:59.590 --> 03:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group uh wants to
 
03:44:01.429 --> 03:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
hone in on for
 
03:44:05.149 --> 03:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
2025 um I know we're looking we've got
 
03:44:07.590 --> 03:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
the uh paint recycling bill that we've
 
03:44:09.990 --> 03:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get through the house and
 
03:44:12.510 --> 03:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully through the Senate um and then
 
03:44:14.429 --> 03:44:14.439 align:start position:0%
I know that you know we've looked at
 
03:44:16.670 --> 03:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
we've done the electronic waste we're
 
03:44:18.670 --> 03:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:44:22.469 --> 03:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
um like I said textiles and mattresses
 
03:44:24.309 --> 03:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
which you know kind of big things big
 
03:44:27.830 --> 03:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
bulky things uh so yeah but in terms of
 
03:44:30.429 --> 03:44:30.439 align:start position:0%
like priorities or what we're studying
 
03:44:31.870 --> 03:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
but I do know that you know we have
 
03:44:33.630 --> 03:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
members on the solid waste working group
 
03:44:35.870 --> 03:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
that are dealing with uh Plastics
 
03:44:38.830 --> 03:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
Recycling and it and it is an issue for
 
03:44:43.030 --> 03:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
um the trash haulers and also um the the
 
03:44:45.429 --> 03:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
waste facilities in deal dealing with
 
03:44:47.429 --> 03:44:47.439 align:start position:0%
all the Plastics and you know from a
 
03:44:51.349 --> 03:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
posos standpoint too um it's it's a
 
03:44:54.550 --> 03:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
contributing factor for for the uh
 
03:44:54.560 --> 03:44:56.110 align:start position:0%
contributing factor for for the uh
contamination

03:44:56.110 --> 03:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
contamination
 
03:44:58.149 --> 03:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
contaminants so I would not see this
 
03:45:00.030 --> 03:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
bill as being contrary to anything that
 
03:45:03.349 --> 03:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
the swag is doing no yeah no okay uh
 
03:45:05.389 --> 03:45:05.399 align:start position:0%
representative Scully you had a question
 
03:45:06.790 --> 03:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Madame chair and thank you
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I I think you're
 
03:45:10.870 --> 03:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
basically covered it my concern was the
 
03:45:13.149 --> 03:45:13.159 align:start position:0%
emphasis of your testimony was Plastics
 
03:45:15.189 --> 03:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
and yet that is not mentioned anywhere
 
03:45:17.389 --> 03:45:17.399 align:start position:0%
in the legislation so there would be no
 
03:45:19.189 --> 03:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
guarantee that this commission would
 
03:45:21.469 --> 03:45:21.479 align:start position:0%
take that issue up to the extent that
 
03:45:23.510 --> 03:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
you would wish it to since it's not
 
03:45:26.149 --> 03:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
specifically mandated to do
 
03:45:29.710 --> 03:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
so can I make that a question I'm sorry
 
03:45:31.149 --> 03:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
can I make that a question and answer
 
03:45:33.389 --> 03:45:33.399 align:start position:0%
would you
 
03:45:36.790 --> 03:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
agree yes uh um I would agree and I
 
03:45:39.710 --> 03:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
would also welcome an amendment that
 
03:45:42.510 --> 03:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
actually specifies in no disputable
 
03:45:43.950 --> 03:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
language that this is dealing with
 
03:45:47.030 --> 03:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
single use care out plastic bags as
 
03:45:49.630 --> 03:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
subed by retail outlets we're not going
 
03:45:51.429 --> 03:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
to get into the plastic bags that you I
 
03:45:53.189 --> 03:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
mean there there's a lot of territory
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
with this and I think it does need to be
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
more specific and I felt like they you
 
03:45:59.790 --> 03:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
know I mean I I felt like that the
 
03:46:02.349 --> 03:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
legislation as it came back to me was
 
03:46:05.309 --> 03:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
less specific so I would agree with you
 
03:46:07.550 --> 03:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gruber thank you
 
03:46:10.590 --> 03:46:10.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh thank you for bringing
 
03:46:13.030 --> 03:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
this issue forward about Plastics is
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
clearly um a serious issue you uh would
 
03:46:18.950 --> 03:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
you be supportive open to the idea if
 
03:46:20.670 --> 03:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
the plast if the solid waste working
 
03:46:23.229 --> 03:46:23.239 align:start position:0%
group said yes we'd like to take this on
 
03:46:25.910 --> 03:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh more specificity of obviously rather
 
03:46:29.189 --> 03:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
than creating another committee here um
 
03:46:31.550 --> 03:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the uh Solway working
 
03:46:33.830 --> 03:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
group is quite knowledgeable and have
 
03:46:36.510 --> 03:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
broad representation and I would presume
 
03:46:38.510 --> 03:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully a lot of clout what what they
 
03:46:42.590 --> 03:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:46.670 --> 03:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
that I would be balance that because
 
03:46:48.429 --> 03:46:48.439 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of institutional
 
03:46:50.189 --> 03:46:50.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge within Solid Waste working
 
03:46:50.199 --> 03:46:52.030 align:start position:0%
knowledge within Solid Waste working
group

03:46:52.030 --> 03:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
group
 
03:46:56.550 --> 03:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
um with the with the concept
 
03:46:58.870 --> 03:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
that right now we have constituents who
 
03:47:01.510 --> 03:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
are crying for Relief on this one we
 
03:47:03.590 --> 03:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
have constituents that are crying for
 
03:47:06.670 --> 03:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
Relief there's a and petition circulated
 
03:47:08.149 --> 03:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
you will hear some results of that later
 
03:47:09.189 --> 03:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:47:12.269 --> 03:47:12.279 align:start position:0%
testimony um I believe there's an immed
 
03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
immediacy to this that might be F might
 
03:47:18.670 --> 03:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
be more directly addressed by a study
 
03:47:20.910 --> 03:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
committee study committee
 
03:47:24.550 --> 03:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you representative ger
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you for
 
03:47:29.429 --> 03:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question good to see you U so
 
03:47:31.389 --> 03:47:31.399 align:start position:0%
I have one question and then if I'm
 
03:47:33.469 --> 03:47:33.479 align:start position:0%
allowed a follow-up question uh the
 
03:47:38.030 --> 03:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
first question is um the subcommittee
 
03:47:40.149 --> 03:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
the study committee would be able to ask
 
03:47:42.349 --> 03:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group to come to
 
03:47:44.510 --> 03:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
some meetings and help provide some of
 
03:47:45.950 --> 03:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
that input to the work of the group
 
03:47:47.870 --> 03:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
correct I understand that's the function
 
03:47:50.950 --> 03:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
of a committee is to solicit testimony
 
03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and may I follow up follow up
 
03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
of course thank you so as I understand
 
03:47:57.750 --> 03:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
these single-use plastic bag bands have
 
03:48:00.070 --> 03:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
kind of mixed history in terms of of
 
03:48:01.910 --> 03:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
success so I'm just wondering if you
 
03:48:03.710 --> 03:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
could give us a sense
 
03:48:06.429 --> 03:48:06.439 align:start position:0%
of why some things work and and some
 
03:48:09.149 --> 03:48:09.159 align:start position:0%
things don't why do some bands not work
 
03:48:12.870 --> 03:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
very well and what has has proven
 
03:48:15.910 --> 03:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
successful I can't say where I've seen
 
03:48:17.870 --> 03:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
them having mixed excess of plastic bag
 
03:48:20.309 --> 03:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
band I know that similar legislation
 
03:48:21.950 --> 03:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes does Fall by the wayside after
 
03:48:25.110 --> 03:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's passed but um I'm when I travel in
 
03:48:29.030 --> 03:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
New York state I I see a state that's
 
03:48:32.349 --> 03:48:32.359 align:start position:0%
that native to me once littered with a
 
03:48:33.870 --> 03:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of plastic plags stuck in
 
03:48:37.309 --> 03:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
trees and blowing in the wind now um
 
03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
when I go to the grocery store there
 
03:48:41.269 --> 03:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
it's a bag free zone plastic bag free
 
03:48:45.030 --> 03:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
zone um I have to imagine I have not
 
03:48:46.349 --> 03:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
been under their landfills but I have
 
03:48:47.870 --> 03:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned has an effect Downstream which
 
03:48:50.790 --> 03:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
is what we're really trying to affect
 
03:48:54.030 --> 03:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
um in Vermont the same issue and and in
 
03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
my visit to main I I've
 
03:48:59.670 --> 03:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
seen firsthand results of what these bag
 
03:49:02.469 --> 03:49:02.479 align:start position:0%
bands do and I I see it would be highly
 
03:49:04.870 --> 03:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
effective thank you okay any other
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%

I'm on the Durham uh citizen advisory
 
03:49:52.149 --> 03:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
committee to our Solid Waste uh
 
03:49:54.110 --> 03:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm also one of the
 
03:49:55.590 --> 03:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
founding members of New Hampshire
 
03:49:57.269 --> 03:49:57.279 align:start position:0%
network and on the steering committee
 
03:49:59.870 --> 03:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire network is four years old
 
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
and it was just founded by number of
 
03:50:04.510 --> 03:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
people from
 
03:50:07.309 --> 03:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
various environmental groups in
 
03:50:08.910 --> 03:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
different towns realizing that we all
 
03:50:11.349 --> 03:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
were asking the same questions and
 
03:50:14.750 --> 03:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
wondering how to respond to what we
 
03:50:17.110 --> 03:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
viewed as concerns and or energy
 
03:50:19.510 --> 03:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
committees what's going on how can we
 
03:50:23.110 --> 03:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
help our towns and by working together
 
03:50:25.469 --> 03:50:25.479 align:start position:0%
we've made it a little bit easier for
 
03:50:28.590 --> 03:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
people to know what is the best way to
 
03:50:30.670 --> 03:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
participate in uh New Hampshire
 
03:50:33.070 --> 03:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
government in terms of sustainability we
 
03:50:35.510 --> 03:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
are all volunteers and the reason I'm
 
03:50:36.910 --> 03:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
telling you about New Hampshire network
 
03:50:39.110 --> 03:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
is we have put together a petition which
 
03:50:41.510 --> 03:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
I'll talk about in one minute but to
 
03:50:45.030 --> 03:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
answer um representative Jana's question
 
03:50:47.990 --> 03:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
um bag bills that have not been
 
03:50:52.229 --> 03:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
successful have either allowed the
 
03:50:54.189 --> 03:50:54.199 align:start position:0%
stores to say oh you don't want
 
03:50:56.309 --> 03:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic we'll give you a
 
03:50:58.630 --> 03:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
thicker plastic which
 
03:51:02.110 --> 03:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
then customers still use as single use
 
03:51:05.110 --> 03:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
and throw away so that there is net more
 
03:51:07.149 --> 03:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
plastic being thrown away than otherwise
 
03:51:09.910 --> 03:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
or places where perhaps it was just the
 
03:51:11.469 --> 03:51:11.479 align:start position:0%
preference of the the individual grocery
 
03:51:16.030 --> 03:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
store and not um the bill they chose not
 
03:51:20.590 --> 03:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
to charge 5 cents 10 cents for whatever
 
03:51:22.990 --> 03:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
kind of bag they gave and then people
 
03:51:25.110 --> 03:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
also were not responsive but in the
 
03:51:28.110 --> 03:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
places where bills were changed to make
 
03:51:29.950 --> 03:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
sure that there was some kind of fee to
 
03:51:32.950 --> 03:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
get a bag and where they made sure that
 
03:51:35.830 --> 03:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
the alternate bags were not just more
 
03:51:37.830 --> 03:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
throwaway plastic in some cases they
 
03:51:39.229 --> 03:51:39.239 align:start position:0%
specified you know it could be a strong
 
03:51:41.790 --> 03:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
plastic bag if it had a stitched handle
 
03:51:44.590 --> 03:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
but when they specified that these these
 
03:51:47.510 --> 03:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
bills have been successful um and and
 
03:51:48.910 --> 03:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
again if you wanted we could get you
 
03:51:50.550 --> 03:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
examples of that okay so I'm going to
 
03:51:53.670 --> 03:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
start out by um I email this to you I
 
03:51:56.070 --> 03:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
had I must um say that we are not
 
03:51:58.030 --> 03:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to use props in the committee
 
03:52:00.429 --> 03:52:00.439 align:start position:0%
rooms oh I'm sorry okay no no so I mean
 
03:52:03.630 --> 03:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
if you if you uh emailed us the charts I
 
03:52:06.750 --> 03:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
did I did okay so that's sufficient um
 
03:52:09.269 --> 03:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
but you can speak to the data that okay
 
03:52:12.030 --> 03:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
so uh plastic kind of got household use
 
03:52:16.469 --> 03:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
in 1950 and then I need to G G by uh for
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
the period 2000 to 220 it had an
 
03:52:22.070 --> 03:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
increase of about 56% so that takes us
 
03:52:25.790 --> 03:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
to there it is forecast to
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
increase uh
 
03:52:31.990 --> 03:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
1003 no it has increased 130 fold and it
 
03:52:35.110 --> 03:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
is expected to Triple Again by
 
03:52:37.790 --> 03:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
2060 so your plastic production it kind
 
03:52:41.670 --> 03:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
of looks like the um heat emissions the
 
03:52:44.110 --> 03:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide emission the hockey
 
03:52:46.110 --> 03:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
hockey stick graph that they talk about
 
03:52:48.110 --> 03:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
you know so plastic is kind of smooth
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
and then suddenly wow and that's part of
 
03:52:52.229 --> 03:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
the reason why we're getting so much
 
03:52:56.189 --> 03:52:56.199 align:start position:0%
information just now about how toxic
 
03:52:58.469 --> 03:52:58.479 align:start position:0%
plastic is oh forgot to hand these out
 
03:53:02.990 --> 03:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
so these are my handouts um they are
 
03:53:05.309 --> 03:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
clipped together because the bottom
 
03:53:07.149 --> 03:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
section is from some health
 
03:53:09.830 --> 03:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
professionals and it's like really since
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
2020 that they are
 
03:53:16.149 --> 03:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
discovering that patients with dementia
 
03:53:17.670 --> 03:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
when they can look at their brains
 
03:53:20.790 --> 03:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
postmortem had 50% more plastic in them
 
03:53:22.710 --> 03:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
and there's an incidence of um you know
 
03:53:25.710 --> 03:53:25.720 align:start position:0%
increased incidence in them so the use
 
03:53:27.830 --> 03:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
of plastic is increasing the effect of
 
03:53:29.389 --> 03:53:29.399 align:start position:0%
plastic is increasing and our
 
03:53:31.349 --> 03:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
understanding of it is and if it seems
 
03:53:33.070 --> 03:53:33.080 align:start position:0%
like why now it's because we're really
 
03:53:35.910 --> 03:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
just coming to full grips with it so let
 
03:53:52.110 --> 03:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:55.950 --> 03:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
okay so uh New Hampshire network has a
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
plastic working group and um I'd never
 
03:54:00.229 --> 03:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
thought about plastic one way or the
 
03:54:02.429 --> 03:54:02.439 align:start position:0%
other but I've been learning and we
 
03:54:04.830 --> 03:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
discovered in our discussions that
 
03:54:08.189 --> 03:54:08.199 align:start position:0%
Jaffrey New London
 
03:54:11.590 --> 03:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
Tamworth Durham we all were having
 
03:54:14.389 --> 03:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
discussions with representatives of
 
03:54:16.510 --> 03:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
major grocery chains in most cases it's
 
03:54:18.149 --> 03:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
it's hanford's that they've been the
 
03:54:22.349 --> 03:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
most um available and those
 
03:54:24.950 --> 03:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives say you're right we
 
03:54:27.070 --> 03:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
would like to stop giving these out we
 
03:54:29.790 --> 03:54:29.800 align:start position:0%
have sustainability goals those include
 
03:54:31.870 --> 03:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
Health we know these plastic bags are
 
03:54:35.349 --> 03:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
not healthy but if we stop our customers
 
03:54:37.990 --> 03:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
will go to our competitors we can't stop
 
03:54:40.189 --> 03:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
unless there's a Level Playing Field we
 
03:54:43.309 --> 03:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
can't stop unless there is legislation
 
03:54:45.910 --> 03:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
requiring us to do this as has happened
 
03:54:49.309 --> 03:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
in Maine Massachusetts Vermont other New
 
03:54:52.510 --> 03:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
England states meanwhile the legislature
 
03:54:54.790 --> 03:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
last year said oh we're not really sure
 
03:54:57.429 --> 03:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
if people want this and it may be that
 
03:55:00.070 --> 03:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
the grocery chains don't want it this
 
03:55:01.830 --> 03:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
cost the grocery stores money you know
 
03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
four to five cents a bag times maybe a
 
03:55:06.790 --> 03:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
thousand bags in a day it mounts up
 
03:55:11.389 --> 03:55:11.399 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly so instead of each of
 
03:55:14.309 --> 03:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
these different towns trying to talk to
 
03:55:16.710 --> 03:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
to the grocery store separately and
 
03:55:20.550 --> 03:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
Jaffrey and uh Tamworth together got 400
 
03:55:23.309 --> 03:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
signatures just in the last year on a on
 
03:55:25.110 --> 03:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
petitions they had done separately
 
03:55:26.870 --> 03:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
instead of doing this town by Town New
 
03:55:28.550 --> 03:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Network said let's work on
 
03:55:30.269 --> 03:55:30.279 align:start position:0%
this Statewide and see if that gives us
 
03:55:34.110 --> 03:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
a little more uh you know we get heard
 
03:55:36.550 --> 03:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
and we are hoping we've only had a
 
03:55:39.349 --> 03:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
petition out for half a month and we've
 
03:55:43.710 --> 03:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
garnered 200 no uh online about 255
 
03:55:45.790 --> 03:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
signatures when I last looked but paper
 
03:55:47.229 --> 03:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
petitions another
 
03:55:50.590 --> 03:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
150 we're in this for the Long Haul so
 
03:55:53.149 --> 03:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
you know we really hope that you the
 
03:55:55.750 --> 03:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
legislators will help speed it up
 
03:55:57.750 --> 03:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
because I know Solid Waste working group
 
03:56:01.389 --> 03:56:01.399 align:start position:0%
has just a huge responsibility but we're
 
03:56:04.910 --> 03:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
also hoping to take our work to the
 
03:56:07.790 --> 03:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
grocery chains to the executives and
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
bring our petitions to churches rotaries
 
03:56:14.710 --> 03:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
Community groups um and get far more
 
03:56:16.830 --> 03:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
signatures we're just really starting
 
03:56:18.429 --> 03:56:18.439 align:start position:0%
out and that's like after the holiday
 
03:56:20.670 --> 03:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
season so we were hampered
 
03:56:24.870 --> 03:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
um so that is where we are with yeah so
 
03:56:26.830 --> 03:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
we feel that there's sort of a chicken
 
03:56:28.590 --> 03:56:28.600 align:start position:0%
egg that you know the grocery stores say
 
03:56:30.790 --> 03:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
go to the legislature legislator says go
 
03:56:32.790 --> 03:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
to the grocery store can we be the
 
03:56:36.550 --> 03:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
brokers in standing for citizens who are
 
03:56:39.910 --> 03:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
across the state um I gave you more
 
03:56:43.070 --> 03:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
information about the evils of plastic
 
03:56:45.229 --> 03:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
the main thing that I want to point out
 
03:56:47.429 --> 03:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
is that it is really toxic when it is
 
03:56:49.750 --> 03:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
being created you know that's your
 
03:56:54.469 --> 03:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
cancer alley um but it also in being end
 
03:56:59.189 --> 03:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
of life a large amount of it is being um
 
03:57:02.070 --> 03:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
incinerated so that's off gassing bad
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
stuff or if it is being so-called
 
03:57:07.469 --> 03:57:07.479 align:start position:0%
recycled there's off gassing in that
 
03:57:09.389 --> 03:57:09.399 align:start position:0%
process and recycled plastic usually
 
03:57:11.590 --> 03:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
only lasts one or two more times before
 
03:57:13.830 --> 03:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
it is too degraded and then of course
 
03:57:16.030 --> 03:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
we' heard about how it it does instead
 
03:57:21.269 --> 03:57:21.279 align:start position:0%
of um just becoming part of the in uh
 
03:57:23.790 --> 03:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
becoming null it becomes smaller
 
03:57:26.309 --> 03:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
particles small enough to pass through
 
03:57:29.309 --> 03:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
cell barriers and that is how they enter
 
03:57:32.590 --> 03:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
the animals we eat our bodies and
 
03:57:34.830 --> 03:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
there's more we do not have the
 
03:57:39.149 --> 03:57:39.159 align:start position:0%
technology to remove the 11 uh Bill
 
03:57:41.630 --> 03:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
million metric tons of plastic pollution
 
03:57:43.870 --> 03:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
that are on the ocean floor okay so I
 
03:57:46.830 --> 03:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
think I have said enough any questions
 
03:57:49.950 --> 03:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I'm I'm wondering if any
 
03:57:52.229 --> 03:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
of the research or findings if you can
 
03:57:55.269 --> 03:57:55.279 align:start position:0%
share that with representative EO from
 
03:57:58.030 --> 03:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group so that uh
 
03:57:59.630 --> 03:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
we can use that as part of our
 
03:58:02.590 --> 03:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
discussions when we meet we meet on a
 
03:58:04.630 --> 03:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
monthly basis I know and I keep trying
 
03:58:07.349 --> 03:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
to get to them and um um because you
 
03:58:09.910 --> 03:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
know that again as I said before a solid
 
03:58:13.309 --> 03:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
waste working group is looking to reduce
 
03:58:16.469 --> 03:58:16.479 align:start position:0%
uh what we landfill right Plastics is a
 
03:58:20.469 --> 03:58:20.479 align:start position:0%
part of that reduction and um gosh I
 
03:58:24.429 --> 03:58:24.439 align:start position:0%
remember you know I I I was of the the
 
03:58:27.429 --> 03:58:27.439 align:start position:0%
time when everything was in paper bags
 
03:58:30.910 --> 03:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
yes and um then when when folks decided
 
03:58:34.269 --> 03:58:34.279 align:start position:0%
that paper bags was uh bad for the
 
03:58:37.030 --> 03:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
environment because it involved cutting
 
03:58:40.510 --> 03:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
down trees uh we all went to plastic so
 
03:58:42.309 --> 03:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
here we are again now we're looking
 
03:58:44.990 --> 03:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
plastic is not good maybe we ought to be
 
03:58:48.750 --> 03:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
going back to paper so here we are turn
 
03:58:50.910 --> 03:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
a circle anyway any other questions
 
03:58:53.309 --> 03:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you madam
 
03:58:55.269 --> 03:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your testimony
 
03:58:57.830 --> 03:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
on this very important topic how will
 
03:59:00.870 --> 03:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
consumers handle the extra expense if
 
03:59:03.269 --> 03:59:03.279 align:start position:0%
they're not given free plastic bags
 
03:59:05.389 --> 03:59:05.399 align:start position:0%
right well stores are in the business of
 
03:59:08.590 --> 03:59:08.600 align:start position:0%
making money giving products and
 
03:59:10.389 --> 03:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
probably they are paying for it in
 
03:59:13.349 --> 03:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
slightly elevated prices of products
 
03:59:17.790 --> 03:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
which is in that is invisible but to get
 
03:59:20.790 --> 03:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
solid you know bags that last longer you
 
03:59:22.950 --> 03:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
can get them for as little as a dollar
 
03:59:24.950 --> 03:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
and is you know if you want organic
 
03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
cotton then we're talking about a lot
 
03:59:28.550 --> 03:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
more but you also have your basic
 
03:59:31.349 --> 03:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
cardboard box and you know grocery
 
03:59:33.389 --> 03:59:33.399 align:start position:0%
stores get their goods in boxes they
 
03:59:36.309 --> 03:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
have boxes Aldi has a little corner
 
03:59:38.510 --> 03:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
where you help yourself to boxes and I
 
03:59:40.630 --> 03:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
believe Market Basket deas used to do
 
03:59:43.670 --> 03:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
that as well so that is not so terrible
 
03:59:43.680 --> 03:59:44.830 align:start position:0%
that as well so that is not so terrible
and

03:59:44.830 --> 03:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:46.990 --> 03:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
our bread still comes in plastic so you
 
03:59:48.870 --> 03:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
can put your dog poop in that when I was
 
03:59:51.790 --> 03:59:51.800 align:start position:0%
a teenager I collected it in a paper bag
 
03:59:53.910 --> 03:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
with a paper towel that was my family
 
03:59:56.750 --> 03:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
task um but
 
04:00:02.030 --> 04:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
so if what people will have to pay for a
 
04:00:07.469 --> 04:00:07.479 align:start position:0%
couple solid bags is not outsized and
 
04:00:10.030 --> 04:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
then they last forever but one of the
 
04:00:11.469 --> 04:00:11.479 align:start position:0%
ways that some bills have been
 
04:00:14.030 --> 04:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
structured has been if you're on Snap or
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
Wick you don't have to pay we're going
 
04:00:18.469 --> 04:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
to just give you the bags so that's
 
04:00:20.670 --> 04:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
another option so again you know fig
 
04:00:22.189 --> 04:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
figured out yeah I'm sorry
 
04:00:22.199 --> 04:00:23.750 align:start position:0%
figured out yeah I'm sorry
representative

04:00:23.750 --> 04:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:00:29.309 --> 04:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so um I uh I happen to be
 
04:00:32.070 --> 04:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
looking at is either the New York Times
 
04:00:34.910 --> 04:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
or Washington Post in the last couple of
 
04:00:39.149 --> 04:00:39.159 align:start position:0%
days and there was an article about um
 
04:00:41.510 --> 04:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
how microplastics are going across the
 
04:00:43.349 --> 04:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
blood brain barrier did you happen to
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
run across the that and is that
 
04:00:47.630 --> 04:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
referenced in any of your yeah uhhuh um
 
04:00:51.149 --> 04:00:51.159 align:start position:0%
the so I've clipped together my two
 
04:00:54.469 --> 04:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
pages three p my two pages is clipped to
 
04:00:57.429 --> 04:00:57.439 align:start position:0%
a onepage double-sided that is medical
 
04:01:00.670 --> 04:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
information from an OBGYN about how
 
04:01:03.309 --> 04:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
plastic is found in the placenta where
 
04:01:06.389 --> 04:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
it um is harmful to a
 
04:01:10.870 --> 04:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
baby's uh growth and organs another and
 
04:01:13.309 --> 04:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
and that has I I think just one
 
04:01:16.030 --> 04:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
reference to it but again Ask me and
 
04:01:18.269 --> 04:01:18.279 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll get some more from an
 
04:01:20.790 --> 04:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
OBGYN who does research and and has been
 
04:01:22.469 --> 04:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
given me this information then there's
 
04:01:25.229 --> 04:01:25.239 align:start position:0%
another paragraph referring to it was
 
04:01:26.990 --> 04:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
Washington Post but I think it was
 
04:01:28.830 --> 04:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
reporting on an article in nature just
 
04:01:31.469 --> 04:01:31.479 align:start position:0%
from the last couple days about how um
 
04:01:35.670 --> 04:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
plastic is affecting mental capacity and
 
04:01:37.790 --> 04:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
and you know I guess being fatal if it's
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
it's increasing dementia and uh I've Got
 
04:01:43.429 --> 04:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
The Source on that and then finally a
 
04:01:45.590 --> 04:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
longer article from New Hampshire
 
04:01:48.429 --> 04:01:48.439 align:start position:0%
Healthy climate um none of those members
 
04:01:49.950 --> 04:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
could be here today but they gave me an
 
04:01:53.750 --> 04:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
article about plastic harming other um
 
04:01:56.910 --> 04:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
organs of the body and that is part of
 
04:01:59.469 --> 04:01:59.479 align:start position:0%
uh the packet of really just visuals
 
04:02:02.630 --> 04:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
that I've sent you okay any other
 
04:02:06.389 --> 04:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you I had
 
04:02:08.349 --> 04:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
somewhat it's it's not strictly it's
 
04:02:11.309 --> 04:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
just a different question so um you may
 
04:02:14.910 --> 04:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
ask a different question uh so
 
04:02:17.110 --> 04:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh there's and I think you kind of
 
04:02:20.110 --> 04:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
alluded to this already but people often
 
04:02:21.950 --> 04:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
will use plastic bags that they get for
 
04:02:23.630 --> 04:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
free at the grocery store for a number
 
04:02:26.750 --> 04:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
of different things like um you know
 
04:02:28.630 --> 04:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
handing off a sweater they want mended
 
04:02:31.830 --> 04:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
to a friend or uh picking up the dog
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
waste as he references referenced or you
 
04:02:37.710 --> 04:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
being a like liner for other trash cans
 
04:02:40.590 --> 04:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh how is is is the loss of that going
 
04:02:42.990 --> 04:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
to be problematic well people will take
 
04:02:44.670 --> 04:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
it as that
 
04:02:47.670 --> 04:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
but you know turning we're all talking
 
04:02:49.710 --> 04:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
about how wonderful Jimmy Carter is
 
04:02:51.309 --> 04:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
people weren't very happy when he said
 
04:02:55.149 --> 04:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
put on a sweater when you're cold so um
 
04:02:58.750 --> 04:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
you know we we need to give give up a
 
04:03:00.670 --> 04:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
little bit on this I can give my friend
 
04:03:03.309 --> 04:03:03.319 align:start position:0%
a sweater without a plastic bag that it
 
04:03:07.229 --> 04:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
is not the responsibility of the food
 
04:03:10.950 --> 04:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
purveyor to provide me for free so I'm
 
04:03:15.110 --> 04:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
not being sympathetic I am sorry
 
04:03:17.229 --> 04:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no other questions thank you
 
04:03:21.309 --> 04:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
very much for Testimony um so I I do
 
04:03:23.429 --> 04:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
want to remind everybody and I you know
 
04:03:27.269 --> 04:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
just in the interest of time to um I
 
04:03:30.349 --> 04:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
think we all recognize the that it's
 
04:03:32.070 --> 04:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
problematic to have all these Plastics
 
04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
in our landfill I think we can all agree
 
04:03:34.000 --> 04:03:34.910 align:start position:0%
in our landfill I think we can all agree
on

04:03:34.910 --> 04:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:03:39.189 --> 04:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
that um so and and this bill itself is
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
just calling for a study committee um on
 
04:03:45.550 --> 04:03:45.560 align:start position:0%
um osal of certain solid waste it
 
04:03:45.560 --> 04:03:47.229 align:start position:0%
um osal of certain solid waste it
doesn't

04:03:47.229 --> 04:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
04:03:50.229 --> 04:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh mean just
 
04:03:53.429 --> 04:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
Plastics and or you know single-use
 
04:03:55.590 --> 04:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
plastic bags so I just want to remind
 
04:03:58.429 --> 04:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
people you know to to stay on um on
 
04:04:02.110 --> 04:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
message with with establishing a study
 
04:04:05.229 --> 04:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
committee as opposed to
 
04:04:10.110 --> 04:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
um explaining U the dangers of Plastics
 
04:04:12.030 --> 04:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
in our life and everything because I
 
04:04:15.030 --> 04:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
think we all understand that so uh with
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
that I would call Cynthia Walter who has
 
04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:27.710 --> 04:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
minutes so just tell us why you think
 
04:04:29.870 --> 04:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea or not a good idea to
 
04:04:31.830 --> 04:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
have a study
 
04:04:35.149 --> 04:04:35.159 align:start position:0%
committee right I hello I'm Cynthia
 
04:04:35.159 --> 04:04:36.830 align:start position:0%
committee right I hello I'm Cynthia
Walter

04:04:36.830 --> 04:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
Walter
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
sorry I try my hearing aids um so I'd
 
04:04:42.149 --> 04:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
like to get you hand hand that around
 
04:04:44.070 --> 04:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
please if you could as quickly thank you
 
04:04:46.710 --> 04:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm Cynthia Walter 22 West conquer
 
04:04:48.910 --> 04:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
Street in Dover I'm also the co-chair of
 
04:04:51.030 --> 04:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
the do plastic production group and I'm
 
04:04:53.349 --> 04:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
not going to talk specifically about
 
04:04:55.670 --> 04:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
plastic harm I'm going to talk about the
 
04:04:58.269 --> 04:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
economic aspects of why this bill is
 
04:05:00.670 --> 04:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
needed at this time and why the study
 
04:05:03.229 --> 04:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
committee is needed at this time now I
 
04:05:08.030 --> 04:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
have read um I think I oh gee I think I
 
04:05:10.149 --> 04:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
may have typed it in the wrong way this
 
04:05:11.870 --> 04:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
is the first page that you're you should
 
04:05:14.070 --> 04:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
be looking at is actually says February
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
3rd on the beginning I was in a hurry to
 
04:05:17.990 --> 04:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
stample things um so if you turn over
 
04:05:19.469 --> 04:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
your page to look for February 3rd on
 
04:05:21.750 --> 04:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
the top um you'll see we have an urgent
 
04:05:24.590 --> 04:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
need and we have to reduce our taxpayer
 
04:05:27.590 --> 04:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
cost for municipal waste that's why we
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
can't wait um we also must accelerate
 
04:05:33.469 --> 04:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
our actions we can't wait to get to 25%
 
04:05:37.790 --> 04:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
cut in by 2050 and third the wonderful
 
04:05:40.110 --> 04:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
the wonderful Solid Waste working group
 
04:05:42.389 --> 04:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
and the terrific Solid Waste Management
 
04:05:45.429 --> 04:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
plan is horrific but that working group
 
04:05:47.870 --> 04:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
is working so hard but when I read that
 
04:05:51.229 --> 04:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
25-page document I tallied up only using
 
04:05:52.790 --> 04:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
five of the goals five of the eight
 
04:05:56.110 --> 04:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
goals I tallied up 120 I have them
 
04:06:00.189 --> 04:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
written down 120 distinctive initiatives
 
04:06:03.309 --> 04:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
in that plan now at a meeting rate of
 
04:06:06.110 --> 04:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
once per month that is 10 years of
 
04:06:06.120 --> 04:06:08.710 align:start position:0%
once per month that is 10 years of
meetings

04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:06:12.670 --> 04:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to make the case that if
 
04:06:17.349 --> 04:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
this study committee could focus on
 
04:06:19.389 --> 04:06:19.399 align:start position:0%
something straightforward and simple
 
04:06:23.670 --> 04:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
that is a no cost solution to a very
 
04:06:26.429 --> 04:06:26.439 align:start position:0%
costly problem you'll see my statistics
 
04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
on the and the numbers on the municipal
 
04:06:31.510 --> 04:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
cost that are we were paying right now
 
04:06:33.389 --> 04:06:33.399 align:start position:0%
if the stat study committee could focus
 
04:06:36.349 --> 04:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
on very targeted legislation that
 
04:06:38.349 --> 04:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
everyone will agree on
 
04:06:41.990 --> 04:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan from do that from May until J
 
04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
August write the report get the
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
legislation put forward we pass it now
 
04:06:52.630 --> 04:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
our municipalities will pay less for so
 
04:06:54.309 --> 04:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
many of the things that they're now
 
04:06:58.189 --> 04:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
paying extra for and increasing so
 
04:07:01.309 --> 04:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm saying the study working
 
04:07:03.269 --> 04:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
group is doing great but they cannot
 
04:07:06.510 --> 04:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
work fast enough on all those things
 
04:07:11.309 --> 04:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
this one particular topic is the no cost
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
easy loow hanging fruit so if you look
 
04:07:17.030 --> 04:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
on my my option one that says on your
 
04:07:19.630 --> 04:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
first page then if you flip over to that
 
04:07:22.550 --> 04:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see the other compelling reasons
 
04:07:25.710 --> 04:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
why we need to work quickly on this it's
 
04:07:28.349 --> 04:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
just been found out that these plastic
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
bags which children are touching and
 
04:07:32.990 --> 04:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
eating and storing food and and holding
 
04:07:35.950 --> 04:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
food and everything else contains um
 
04:07:37.670 --> 04:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
toxics that impair their development it
 
04:07:41.429 --> 04:07:41.439 align:start position:0%
leads to harm um and and Lead so we're
 
04:07:44.510 --> 04:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with a compelling substance that
 
04:07:48.510 --> 04:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
we could remove from children's hands
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
from Suffocation risks and so on we can
 
04:07:53.710 --> 04:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
quickly get rid of that so I'm saying
 
04:07:56.510 --> 04:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of speed here it's not the
 
04:07:58.870 --> 04:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
intens it's not the scope of the problem
 
04:08:01.030 --> 04:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's the speed that we need to address
 
04:08:03.349 --> 04:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
it and this one study committee can
 
04:08:07.189 --> 04:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
focus laser on that topic also um if you
 
04:08:08.990 --> 04:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
go down to the end you know you'll see
 
04:08:11.830 --> 04:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
the costs are huge we're paying millions
 
04:08:13.750 --> 04:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
of we have two million pounds now we're
 
04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
dumping 20 65 million pounds in grocery
 
04:08:20.030 --> 04:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
bags every year if we put that bill out
 
04:08:22.710 --> 04:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
65 million pounds of grocery plastic
 
04:08:25.790 --> 04:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
bags will not be in our landfills
 
04:08:28.750 --> 04:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
immediately so the speed really makes
 
04:08:31.429 --> 04:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
the difference um they're costing our
 
04:08:34.030 --> 04:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
our bills with our Waste Management
 
04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
Services are going up by 50,000 or more
 
04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
dollars every unit every time we we try
 
04:08:43.149 --> 04:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
to contract with somebody and why
 
04:08:45.910 --> 04:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
because those stupid plastic bags are
 
04:08:48.550 --> 04:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
tangling up the equipment and requiring
 
04:08:51.710 --> 04:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
huge shutdown times so our bills are
 
04:08:53.630 --> 04:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
going up which means our taxes are going
 
04:08:55.910 --> 04:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
up because that's how we pay for our our
 
04:08:58.469 --> 04:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
waste handling so I mean the speed at
 
04:09:00.870 --> 04:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
which this committee could deliver this
 
04:09:04.109 --> 04:09:04.119 align:start position:0%
solution is so important for our tax
 
04:09:06.670 --> 04:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
reduction and and TOA here's another one
 
04:09:10.149 --> 04:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
this is amazing DOA right now every year
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
pays um more pays 350 ,000 to dispose of
 
04:09:17.429 --> 04:09:17.439 align:start position:0%
contaminated plastic contaminated
 
04:09:19.870 --> 04:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
recycling waste because it's
 
04:09:24.070 --> 04:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
contaminated mostly with grocery bags so
 
04:09:25.910 --> 04:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're hauling this stuff at
 
04:09:29.070 --> 04:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
$350,000 a year we will have cleaner
 
04:09:33.469 --> 04:09:33.479 align:start position:0%
recycling bins immediately if we don't
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
have plastic bags rolling out of the
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
grocery stores so I'm saying we're doing
 
04:09:39.990 --> 04:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
thousands thousands of dollars and
 
04:09:43.070 --> 04:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
millions of pounds of waste right away
 
04:09:46.950 --> 04:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
and many children living safer at home
 
04:09:49.510 --> 04:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
because we won't have those plastic bags
 
04:09:51.389 --> 04:09:51.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry but the the solid waste
 
04:09:53.109 --> 04:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
working group you just have so much on
 
04:09:55.990 --> 04:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
your plate that that you couldn't work
 
04:09:57.750 --> 04:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
quite as fast as this committee could
 
04:09:59.630 --> 04:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
work does that
 
04:10:03.469 --> 04:10:03.479 align:start position:0%
help thank you and I'm glad that you uh
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
you included the New Hampshire Solid
 
04:10:07.790 --> 04:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
Waste Management plan where it does show
 
04:10:09.990 --> 04:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
that landfilling is our last
 
04:10:15.550 --> 04:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
resort um and that um you know yes we
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
have um 120 distinct initiatives we are
 
04:10:23.630 --> 04:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
not tackling them um um you know one
 
04:10:26.630 --> 04:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
after another serially they are we are
 
04:10:28.630 --> 04:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
looking at multiple ones different I
 
04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
mean we got Dees working on some things
 
04:10:35.149 --> 04:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
we've got uh H uh the New Hampshire uh
 
04:10:37.550 --> 04:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
recovery recycling Association looking
 
04:10:40.750 --> 04:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
at some things so we have several people
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
who are doing different things which is
 
04:10:45.149 --> 04:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
why I am thinking that all of the
 
04:10:47.710 --> 04:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
research that you and your organizations
 
04:10:50.109 --> 04:10:50.119 align:start position:0%
and all of you folks who have come to
 
04:10:54.149 --> 04:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
testify uh have have come equipped with
 
04:10:56.710 --> 04:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
and knowledgeable of if that information
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
is shared with solid waste working group
 
04:11:00.910 --> 04:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
that cuts out the time that we need to
 
04:11:03.070 --> 04:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
do the research you have that
 
04:11:05.349 --> 04:11:05.359 align:start position:0%
information you can say you know here's
 
04:11:07.710 --> 04:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
all the information that we have in what
 
04:11:09.550 --> 04:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
other states are doing what other towns
 
04:11:12.790 --> 04:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
are doing and so and so forth and um
 
04:11:14.590 --> 04:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
these are
 
04:11:17.469 --> 04:11:17.479 align:start position:0%
recommendations that would be that that
 
04:11:19.149 --> 04:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
you guys have been the study committee
 
04:11:21.429 --> 04:11:21.439 align:start position:0%
you're doing all the work so just share
 
04:11:23.070 --> 04:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
your results with solid waste working
 
04:11:25.870 --> 04:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
group I think um would you think that
 
04:11:28.269 --> 04:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
that would be a good
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
idea well again I'm only a citizen and
 
04:11:35.830 --> 04:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
I'm only a retired teacher and so I I
 
04:11:40.269 --> 04:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
don't know how legislation gets
 
04:11:43.830 --> 04:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
worded so and processed so that all the
 
04:11:48.149 --> 04:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and all the opposition is
 
04:11:50.269 --> 04:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
just hand is
 
04:11:53.469 --> 04:11:53.479 align:start position:0%
considered as the legislation is doing
 
04:11:55.990 --> 04:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
so far living five years in in in New
 
04:11:58.229 --> 04:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now I'm very impressed with
 
04:12:00.790 --> 04:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
how engaged all of you folks are I'm I'm
 
04:12:02.830 --> 04:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
astounded that you're all here and
 
04:12:04.590 --> 04:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
you're doing all this wonderful work for
 
04:12:09.630 --> 04:12:09.640 align:start position:0%
just travel money but anyway so here's
 
04:12:12.670 --> 04:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
my concern about that the solid waste
 
04:12:14.870 --> 04:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
working group group may not have the
 
04:12:18.990 --> 04:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
time between now and August September
 
04:12:20.750 --> 04:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
when this report would be written by a
 
04:12:23.269 --> 04:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
working group Sorry by a study committee
 
04:12:24.990 --> 04:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
you may not have the time between now
 
04:12:27.950 --> 04:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
and then to actually fine-tune
 
04:12:30.670 --> 04:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
legislation engage stakeholders make
 
04:12:33.309 --> 04:12:33.319 align:start position:0%
sure the grocery stores are all on board
 
04:12:35.349 --> 04:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
the the the the documents written
 
04:12:37.030 --> 04:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
exactly as it should be and then the
 
04:12:39.830 --> 04:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
bill will go into the whatever happens
 
04:12:42.670 --> 04:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
in in in the mill um in the fall and
 
04:12:46.469 --> 04:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
then that bill will be will be hray and
 
04:12:48.349 --> 04:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
um passed by partisan and signed by the
 
04:12:51.189 --> 04:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
governor by Next by this coming June um
 
04:12:53.790 --> 04:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
a year from now I don't know if if you
 
04:12:56.229 --> 04:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
have other pressing needs like you
 
04:12:57.790 --> 04:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
talked about electronic waste which is
 
04:12:59.670 --> 04:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
so toxic and you talked about all those
 
04:13:01.309 --> 04:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
other things you have other more
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
pressing things so maybe you wouldn't
 
04:13:05.670 --> 04:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
have the time I agree you have the
 
04:13:07.910 --> 04:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
capacity and the interest to do it but I
 
04:13:09.070 --> 04:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have the time to
 
04:13:11.950 --> 04:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
fine-tune that legislation to make sure
 
04:13:13.990 --> 04:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's ready to roll
 
04:13:15.990 --> 04:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
exactly without opposition and the
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
stakeholders have been heard and have
 
04:13:18.479 --> 04:13:19.229 align:start position:0%
stakeholders have been heard and have
been

04:13:19.229 --> 04:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
addressed that's the advantage of having
 
04:13:25.229 --> 04:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
one group doing one thing I agree you're
 
04:13:27.109 --> 04:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
I know you're not doing 120 things one
 
04:13:29.469 --> 04:13:29.479 align:start position:0%
unit at a time but I just thought it was
 
04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
kind of amusing that it was so big a
 
04:13:36.550 --> 04:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
list um so that's my only comeback on
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
that and I again I'm not a legislator
 
04:13:40.910 --> 04:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
but I would like to see this bill get
 
04:13:45.229 --> 04:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
done perfectly ready and signed by next
 
04:13:48.590 --> 04:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
June so we don't have all those toxins
 
04:13:51.109 --> 04:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
in our children's hands we don't have
 
04:13:53.790 --> 04:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
that 65 million pounds going dumping
 
04:13:56.149 --> 04:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
into our Landfield every year we don't
 
04:13:58.189 --> 04:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
have those extra thousands that I talked
 
04:14:01.870 --> 04:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
about um um that I'm paying in my taxes
 
04:14:04.269 --> 04:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Bixby so
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
um if we were to uh consult with uh
 
04:14:09.870 --> 04:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
representative eel who is the chair of
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group about
 
04:14:15.269 --> 04:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
whether this would be the more efficient
 
04:14:19.429 --> 04:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
way to get to the right point or uh if
 
04:14:22.070 --> 04:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
in fact having moving it up the priority
 
04:14:23.590 --> 04:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
listed the solid wayte working group
 
04:14:25.630 --> 04:14:25.640 align:start position:0%
would be more efficient would you be
 
04:14:27.990 --> 04:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
happy with whichever solution as long as
 
04:14:31.269 --> 04:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
it got got got it there faster
 
04:14:34.950 --> 04:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
you representative evil is is amazing so
 
04:14:37.590 --> 04:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
yes you all are amazing so I think your
 
04:14:39.990 --> 04:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
advice definitely I definitely bow to
 
04:14:42.030 --> 04:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
your advice I I
 
04:14:45.309 --> 04:14:45.319 align:start position:0%
know chemicals and insects and streams I
 
04:14:47.030 --> 04:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
do not know legislation that's your
 
04:14:49.590 --> 04:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
expertise you can decide which is the
 
04:14:51.790 --> 04:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
better way to get this done I see now
 
04:14:53.910 --> 04:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
that you really want to get it done and
 
04:14:55.630 --> 04:14:55.640 align:start position:0%
we will get it done one way or another
 
04:14:58.109 --> 04:14:58.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to see that bill in um um
 
04:15:02.830 --> 04:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
June of 26 yay yes represent hkin thank
 
04:15:05.189 --> 04:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for coming
 
04:15:08.510 --> 04:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
to testify with us today would you agree
 
04:15:10.950 --> 04:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
that part of the urgency is that some of
 
04:15:14.269 --> 04:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
our grocery stores are ask ask in us as
 
04:15:18.070 --> 04:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
consumers when we buy meat that's pla
 
04:15:21.030 --> 04:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's wrapped in plastic if we want it
 
04:15:24.269 --> 04:15:24.279 align:start position:0%
in yet an additional plastic bag does
 
04:15:27.790 --> 04:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
that in your opinion add to the urgency
 
04:15:30.070 --> 04:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
of the need for the study
 
04:15:32.630 --> 04:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
committee I couldn't address the issue
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
of packaging meat um that's see that's
 
04:15:41.070 --> 04:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
exactly an example of the kind of carve
 
04:15:44.109 --> 04:15:44.119 align:start position:0%
out we might have to have that the
 
04:15:45.830 --> 04:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
stores would have to say but we should
 
04:15:47.990 --> 04:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
be allowed to do this we were talking
 
04:15:50.109 --> 04:15:50.119 align:start position:0%
about plastic bags at the checkout and
 
04:15:52.550 --> 04:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
so that's exactly the kind of detail for
 
04:15:56.269 --> 04:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
safety reasons um sanitation reasons or
 
04:15:59.309 --> 04:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
com Comm customer Comfort reasons that
 
04:16:02.189 --> 04:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
we would have to address um so that we
 
04:16:05.630 --> 04:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
sure we don't you know leave somebody in
 
04:16:08.070 --> 04:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
in in the in the out of the loop um and
 
04:16:09.990 --> 04:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's why that's another you you just
 
04:16:11.630 --> 04:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
raise a point that's why the study
 
04:16:13.309 --> 04:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
commit could hear about from The
 
04:16:16.349 --> 04:16:16.359 align:start position:0%
Butchers and say Here's here's what The
 
04:16:19.070 --> 04:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
Butchers need to have to make sure they
 
04:16:22.269 --> 04:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
can have their needs and their customers
 
04:16:25.670 --> 04:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
needs met thank you any other questions
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative sofikitis
 
04:16:32.790 --> 04:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
um thanks for coming um don't ever say
 
04:16:36.830 --> 04:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
again um you're only a teacher because
 
04:16:39.109 --> 04:16:39.119 align:start position:0%
it's like oh you're just a mother
 
04:16:42.670 --> 04:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
whatever because I'm just a State Rep
 
04:16:42.680 --> 04:16:44.510 align:start position:0%
whatever because I'm just a State Rep
yeah

04:16:44.510 --> 04:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:16:47.149 --> 04:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
we have a Citizens
 
04:16:50.950 --> 04:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
legislature and um so I would just ask
 
04:16:53.269 --> 04:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
you have you ever thought about running
 
04:16:55.630 --> 04:16:55.640 align:start position:0%
for public
 
04:16:55.640 --> 04:16:57.510 align:start position:0%
for public
office

04:16:57.510 --> 04:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
office
 
04:17:00.229 --> 04:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
okay than you very I'm gonna have to ask
 
04:17:03.070 --> 04:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
to stick to the uh to the bill here it's
 
04:17:07.030 --> 04:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
part of studying yeah appreciate it any
 
04:17:10.109 --> 04:17:10.119 align:start position:0%
other questions representative guber uh
 
04:17:13.550 --> 04:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
just quickly um clearly your goal is a
 
04:17:16.429 --> 04:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
strategic plan to get something next
 
04:17:19.790 --> 04:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
fall as a bill yes um and you need all
 
04:17:22.550 --> 04:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
these resources and the question I have
 
04:17:24.309 --> 04:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
that's been brought up a number of times
 
04:17:26.030 --> 04:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
you're already doing a lot of the work
 
04:17:28.670 --> 04:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
but um and representative EO and and
 
04:17:30.910 --> 04:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
cration working group I don't know if
 
04:17:33.229 --> 04:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
this Committee of five who don't
 
04:17:35.870 --> 04:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily know anything would actually
 
04:17:38.510 --> 04:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
accelerate things or slow things down um
 
04:17:39.910 --> 04:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
what do you thought about this because
 
04:17:41.590 --> 04:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
we have you want to get people who have
 
04:17:43.630 --> 04:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
working who are committed to looking at
 
04:17:45.830 --> 04:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done and not bring new
 
04:17:47.830 --> 04:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
people in necessarily so my concern what
 
04:17:49.910 --> 04:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
you thought about that because five
 
04:17:51.870 --> 04:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
people that are just appointed May who
 
04:17:54.830 --> 04:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
knows well I I did happen to attend a
 
04:17:56.790 --> 04:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
couple of sessions in another study
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
group another study uh committee not a
 
04:18:01.670 --> 04:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
study group I don't know terminology but
 
04:18:03.510 --> 04:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
a study committee and what what I was
 
04:18:06.790 --> 04:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
impressed about is it's the the
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
combination of having the study
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
committee focused on one topic right so
 
04:18:15.990 --> 04:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
they can use the information that's
 
04:18:18.790 --> 04:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
already been garnered as you said by the
 
04:18:22.189 --> 04:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh um um study working group in looking
 
04:18:23.830 --> 04:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
at the bigger pictures and looking at
 
04:18:25.269 --> 04:18:25.279 align:start position:0%
some of the knowing the list of
 
04:18:27.269 --> 04:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and so on but then the
 
04:18:29.309 --> 04:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
study committee can take the
 
04:18:31.950 --> 04:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that the study group said I
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
identified are important and here's the
 
04:18:37.229 --> 04:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
extra part they can take the people who
 
04:18:39.550 --> 04:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
know how to write
 
04:18:43.710 --> 04:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
legislation such that it is trouble free
 
04:18:45.790 --> 04:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
who know how to consider things like the
 
04:18:47.790 --> 04:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
The Butcher and so on and put that into
 
04:18:51.030 --> 04:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
it and so I think it's a matter of
 
04:18:53.750 --> 04:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
getting those different perspectives Al
 
04:18:56.750 --> 04:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
together on one topic so I agree they've
 
04:18:59.630 --> 04:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
the study working group has a lot of
 
04:19:04.750 --> 04:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
study time on so many topics but their
 
04:19:07.630 --> 04:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
expertise can be part of the picture
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's necessary but not sufficient okay
 
04:19:11.950 --> 04:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much I really
 
04:19:15.750 --> 04:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:18.790 --> 04:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
now yeah I've got four cards left and
 
04:19:20.269 --> 04:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
we're running out of we've run out of
 
04:19:22.429 --> 04:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
time ready but I thank you very M very
 
04:19:25.030 --> 04:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
much Miss Walter for coming and speaking
 
04:19:27.630 --> 04:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
with us this afternoon um I call
 
04:19:30.510 --> 04:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
Christine babber and again if if you've
 
04:19:32.469 --> 04:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
heard something already that
 
04:19:36.670 --> 04:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
you've uh been thinking of saying please
 
04:19:40.429 --> 04:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
don't repeat it appreciate
 
04:19:45.590 --> 04:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
it uh from do plastic reduction group th
 
04:19:48.510 --> 04:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony and I
 
04:19:52.670 --> 04:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
will try not to repeat anything um it
 
04:19:55.109 --> 04:19:55.119 align:start position:0%
it's very encouraging to hear the the
 
04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
discussion and the questions um my name
 
04:20:02.590 --> 04:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
is Christine babber and I am co-chair of
 
04:20:06.469 --> 04:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
the Dover plastic reduction group so I
 
04:20:09.670 --> 04:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
am speaking in support of this bill and
 
04:20:13.469 --> 04:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
I will try to um focus on the Bill and
 
04:20:18.429 --> 04:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
that give um information on plastic that
 
04:20:19.990 --> 04:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
you have already
 
04:20:25.910 --> 04:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
heard um the the solid waste that our
 
04:20:29.389 --> 04:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
group is seeking to reduce is of course
 
04:20:32.550 --> 04:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
Plastics which is why I will be focused
 
04:20:36.670 --> 04:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
on Plastics um Plastics according to the
 
04:20:40.870 --> 04:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
US Environmental Protection Agency are
 
04:20:44.550 --> 04:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
the second largest contributor to
 
04:20:47.189 --> 04:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
Municipal Solid Waste
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:54.990 --> 04:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
18.5% the
 
04:20:58.429 --> 04:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
2022 New Hampshire Solid Waste
 
04:21:01.309 --> 04:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
Management plan has one of its
 
04:21:04.830 --> 04:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
overarching themes reducing and
 
04:21:08.750 --> 04:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
diverting waste So the plan states that
 
04:21:11.790 --> 04:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
efforts should focus on high volume and
 
04:21:13.469 --> 04:21:13.479 align:start position:0%
weight material
 
04:21:17.469 --> 04:21:17.479 align:start position:0%
as well as single use products and
 
04:21:20.469 --> 04:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
packaging so I think one of the reasons
 
04:21:24.510 --> 04:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
why you've heard so much Focus um on on
 
04:21:28.910 --> 04:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic bags in addition to
 
04:21:32.550 --> 04:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative parshall's uh
 
04:21:36.630 --> 04:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
explanation is that they would be one of
 
04:21:40.389 --> 04:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
the easiest single-use products that
 
04:21:43.790 --> 04:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
could be considered for reduction in New
 
04:21:46.750 --> 04:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they are distributed in huge
 
04:21:49.870 --> 04:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
quantities in grocery stores and there
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
are actually easy reusable
 
04:21:58.389 --> 04:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
Alternatives so uh I think um you know
 
04:22:02.670 --> 04:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
again to give some sense of the um the
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
size of this issue Americans use an
 
04:22:09.550 --> 04:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
average of
 
04:22:15.510 --> 04:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
365 plastic bags per per person per year
 
04:22:18.149 --> 04:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
and the average working life of those
 
04:22:23.269 --> 04:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:25.950 --> 04:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
minutes according to the American
 
04:22:30.149 --> 04:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
Chemical Society studies on plastic
 
04:22:33.070 --> 04:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
degradation estimate it could take
 
04:22:37.429 --> 04:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 300 to a, years for these
 
04:22:41.070 --> 04:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
bags to break down uh depending on the
 
04:22:43.269 --> 04:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
environment the temperature tempature
 
04:22:46.590 --> 04:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
microbial loading uh size and shape of
 
04:22:52.630 --> 04:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
the sample Etc so they not only uh fill
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
our landfills but also last for a really
 
04:22:59.790 --> 04:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
long time so again the focus on that I
 
04:23:04.429 --> 04:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
am very proud that dover's Recycling and
 
04:23:07.429 --> 04:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
Waste Management Programs mission
 
04:23:11.309 --> 04:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
statement names reduction first among
 
04:23:13.030 --> 04:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
methods to efficient
 
04:23:16.030 --> 04:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
manage and implement the recycling and
 
04:23:20.389 --> 04:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
waste management programs of the city um
 
04:23:25.389 --> 04:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
I I used an environment America research
 
04:23:28.990 --> 04:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
and policy centers single use plastic
 
04:23:32.550 --> 04:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
bag waste reduction calculator to
 
04:23:35.630 --> 04:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
estimate the impact eliminating
 
04:23:39.030 --> 04:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic bags in Dover would
 
04:23:41.349 --> 04:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
have in one year and you can run this
 
04:23:43.870 --> 04:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
for your own community Community there
 
04:23:43.880 --> 04:23:44.950 align:start position:0%
for your own community Community there
would

04:23:44.950 --> 04:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:23:44.960 --> 04:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
would
be

04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
9,891 th000 fewer single use plastic
 
04:24:00.469 --> 04:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
bags to pollute our environment in do
 
04:24:04.830 --> 04:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:08.950 --> 04:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
1,717 miles laid Side by
 
04:24:11.109 --> 04:24:11.119 align:start position:0%
Side in New
 
04:24:14.269 --> 04:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the single-use plastic bags
 
04:24:18.389 --> 04:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
eliminated by a typical Statewide policy
 
04:24:22.429 --> 04:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
eliminating these bags would be
 
04:24:22.439 --> 04:24:25.510 align:start position:0%
eliminating these bags would be
412

04:24:25.510 --> 04:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:30.189 --> 04:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
m988 th000 laid side by side okay excuse
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
me I'm I'm going to have to stop you
 
04:24:35.510 --> 04:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay um because while I appreciate you
 
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
know a lot of the information here about
 
04:24:42.670 --> 04:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
um why we ought to ban plastic bag
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
single-use PL plastic bags that's
 
04:24:47.309 --> 04:24:47.319 align:start position:0%
actually not the bill that we're talking
 
04:24:51.070 --> 04:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
about this would be absolutely um
 
04:24:52.910 --> 04:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
perfect testimony if we had a bill
 
04:24:55.670 --> 04:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
before us that actually did ban plastic
 
04:24:58.590 --> 04:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
bags but we what we're talking about is
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not we want to have a study
 
04:25:02.189 --> 04:25:02.199 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
04:25:05.590 --> 04:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
investigate um disposal of certain Solid
 
04:25:09.990 --> 04:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
Waste within landfills and um I I just
 
04:25:12.590 --> 04:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to stay on track with that and
 
04:25:14.710 --> 04:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
okay even though I I I do appreciate all
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
your research and information which is
 
04:25:20.149 --> 04:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
valid um I I just wanted to let you know
 
04:25:23.990 --> 04:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you so I I do support
 
04:25:27.469 --> 04:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
this bill and I agree with the urgency
 
04:25:31.950 --> 04:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
that has been expressed by previous um
 
04:25:37.870 --> 04:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
speakers and um want also to offer the
 
04:25:42.510 --> 04:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
expertise the um research anything that
 
04:25:46.710 --> 04:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
we can offer to either a study committee
 
04:25:50.269 --> 04:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
or the solid waste working group um you
 
04:25:52.349 --> 04:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
know and I and I believe that
 
04:25:55.510 --> 04:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's suggestion is a
 
04:25:59.790 --> 04:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
good one um for for everyone to consider
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so thank you sure any
 
04:26:04.750 --> 04:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
questions uh you have written testimony
 
04:26:06.910 --> 04:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
you can share with us okay can you pass
 
04:26:08.990 --> 04:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
it up so that we can have that for the
 
04:26:13.870 --> 04:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
clerk um I'm going to ask Ann pod pod Li
 
04:26:15.910 --> 04:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
04:26:18.830 --> 04:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
Podi good afternoon yes my name is an
 
04:26:21.189 --> 04:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
pod lipney I was going to read the
 
04:26:23.990 --> 04:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
testimony of a plastic engineer named
 
04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
Mark Barry who could not be here today
 
04:26:28.750 --> 04:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm not going to given your
 
04:26:31.189 --> 04:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation to stick to uh the
 
04:26:34.630 --> 04:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
subject so I do support this bill I am a
 
04:26:36.590 --> 04:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire Network
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
Plastics working group and my little
 
04:26:41.630 --> 04:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
piece it won't take but a minute I am
 
04:26:43.590 --> 04:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
one of those folks who went out to seek
 
04:26:46.309 --> 04:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
petitions on the plastic uh on banning
 
04:26:49.550 --> 04:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
plastic uh bags and in a matter of 3
 
04:26:53.389 --> 04:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
hours I easily got 60 petitions it
 
04:26:55.870 --> 04:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
seemed to me as if the public is
 
04:26:58.469 --> 04:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely aware that recycling is no
 
04:27:00.630 --> 04:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
longer working and is not the right
 
04:27:03.429 --> 04:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
answer to this problem I really felt
 
04:27:05.750 --> 04:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
that people were waiting for a bill like
 
04:27:08.109 --> 04:27:08.119 align:start position:0%
this I mean for a petition like this to
 
04:27:10.429 --> 04:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
come into their hands so they could sign
 
04:27:14.590 --> 04:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
it any argument that came to me was
 
04:27:18.309 --> 04:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
easily refuted um by people understood
 
04:27:20.870 --> 04:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
when they said oh you know uh what will
 
04:27:23.229 --> 04:27:23.239 align:start position:0%
I do with my pet waste and a good answer
 
04:27:26.349 --> 04:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
was given they were immediately able to
 
04:27:29.309 --> 04:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
sort of reconfigure that answer and and
 
04:27:31.269 --> 04:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
actually accept it as opposed to
 
04:27:34.149 --> 04:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
remaining stubborn and oppositional so I
 
04:27:37.109 --> 04:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
my point is simply that people know that
 
04:27:39.630 --> 04:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
right now in this day and age recycling
 
04:27:42.349 --> 04:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
is not the answer they know that plastic
 
04:27:45.070 --> 04:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
is either buried burned or borne out to
 
04:27:47.830 --> 04:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
sea they don't want it and I think that
 
04:27:50.229 --> 04:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
the time is ripe right now and people
 
04:27:52.550 --> 04:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
are really paying attention so I think
 
04:27:54.790 --> 04:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
this would be an excellent idea to push
 
04:27:57.469 --> 04:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
forward thank you any questions from the
 
04:28:00.309 --> 04:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
04:28:02.950 --> 04:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
much for coming today thank you uh Ray
 
04:28:08.070 --> 04:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:10.389 --> 04:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
speak again please let us know whether
 
04:28:12.429 --> 04:28:12.439 align:start position:0%
you think it's a good idea or not to to
 
04:28:14.990 --> 04:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
establish a study committee okay I'm
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
going to do that uh Ray reslin uh I'm
 
04:28:20.510 --> 04:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
just a citizen uh I'm learning like
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
everyone else I think there's a lot of
 
04:28:24.510 --> 04:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
good things that have been uh brought
 
04:28:29.389 --> 04:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
forward uh today uh and uh as far as uh
 
04:28:33.429 --> 04:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
be uh wanting to be approv or against it
 
04:28:35.309 --> 04:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
uh I think that's something you folk
 
04:28:39.910 --> 04:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
have to decide uh look uh this thing
 
04:28:42.950 --> 04:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
about uh plastic bags which I don't see
 
04:28:46.670 --> 04:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
even in this uh Bill uh which I don't
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
understand why it's not in there if
 
04:28:49.910 --> 04:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's what your focus is going to be uh
 
04:28:52.510 --> 04:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
but it is a problem plastic bags are a
 
04:28:55.550 --> 04:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
problem uh definitely uh do need to be
 
04:28:58.550 --> 04:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
dealt with and uh they do not need to go
 
04:29:00.910 --> 04:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
to a landfill because they don't break
 
04:29:03.189 --> 04:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
down I I think you'll probably find that
 
04:29:06.750 --> 04:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
most plastic bags uh after the uh
 
04:29:09.550 --> 04:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately have to be separated uh
 
04:29:11.510 --> 04:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
because most of it goes down to Bill R
 
04:29:14.109 --> 04:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
to be separated ated uh that Mo most of
 
04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
those plastic bags become a source of
 
04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
energy and probably get burnt at a uh
 
04:29:24.870 --> 04:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
waste to energy plant uh probably right
 
04:29:28.750 --> 04:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
here in conquer uh but uh all of this is
 
04:29:31.630 --> 04:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
extremely important all of this with uh
 
04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste or any kind of waste uh
 
04:29:37.349 --> 04:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
recycle is really important and your
 
04:29:40.189 --> 04:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
working group uh with with all you have
 
04:29:42.830 --> 04:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
to do uh uh try trying to do good work
 
04:29:45.870 --> 04:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure you are uh in regards to uh
 
04:29:47.950 --> 04:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
the other folks that have uh spoken here
 
04:29:51.229 --> 04:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
today uh I think uh they they they are
 
04:29:53.630 --> 04:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
paying attention they are very good and
 
04:29:56.830 --> 04:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
I think uh they are willing to volunteer
 
04:29:59.710 --> 04:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
their time uh to put into this to do the
 
04:30:01.870 --> 04:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
studies and come back and work with you
 
04:30:05.469 --> 04:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
folks uh to uh make some good progress
 
04:30:08.670 --> 04:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
in this but this whole thing with waste
 
04:30:11.309 --> 04:30:11.319 align:start position:0%
and plastic and so forth and
 
04:30:11.319 --> 04:30:12.469 align:start position:0%
and plastic and so forth and
unfortunately

04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
04:30:13.830 --> 04:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh I don't want to get off topic here
 
04:30:15.550 --> 04:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
but some of that is coming from out of
 
04:30:18.550 --> 04:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
state and and we got to deal with it
 
04:30:21.149 --> 04:30:21.159 align:start position:0%
including plastic bags by the way and
 
04:30:23.510 --> 04:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
and so it's a big issue I don't want to
 
04:30:25.109 --> 04:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
take any more time because you got a lot
 
04:30:28.429 --> 04:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
to do and uh I certainly have nothing
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
against a committee I'm not sure exactly
 
04:30:33.670 --> 04:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
how that's established but obviously
 
04:30:36.389 --> 04:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
there are some people here that are
 
04:30:38.790 --> 04:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
concerned with this and I I think would
 
04:30:42.269 --> 04:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
be willing to work with you folks uh to
 
04:30:44.349 --> 04:30:44.359 align:start position:0%
get stuff done okay that's all I got to
 
04:30:47.910 --> 04:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
say thank you very much any questions oh
 
04:30:49.950 --> 04:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
nope you're all good thank you very much
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming today our last uh
 
04:30:56.109 --> 04:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
pink card is uh John Tut Hill from my
 
04:31:03.950 --> 04:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
Hill U thank you chairman Aaron U
 
04:31:08.550 --> 04:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee nice to see you
 
04:31:11.070 --> 04:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
all I will be very quick uh and I will
 
04:31:13.389 --> 04:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
not mention any
 
04:31:15.389 --> 04:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
hydrocarbons although I do have concerns
 
04:31:18.189 --> 04:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
about additive stabilizers and uh
 
04:31:18.199 --> 04:31:19.710 align:start position:0%
about additive stabilizers and uh
tolerance

04:31:19.710 --> 04:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
tolerance
 
04:31:23.469 --> 04:31:23.479 align:start position:0%
um I like this bill as presented um and
 
04:31:24.830 --> 04:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
I would support the more General
 
04:31:27.550 --> 04:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
approach and I strongly support uh
 
04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
establishing the study committee and not
 
04:31:32.830 --> 04:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
relying on the working group in the 80s
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
the environmental councils were formed
 
04:31:37.670 --> 04:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
and part of their mandate was to uh do
 
04:31:40.510 --> 04:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
public education and to advise the
 
04:31:41.870 --> 04:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of envir
 
04:31:44.070 --> 04:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
enal services on
 
04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
policy on waste policy specifically for
 
04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
the waste management
 
04:31:52.389 --> 04:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
Council um for almost decades really
 
04:31:54.830 --> 04:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
there were about five or six words which
 
04:31:56.910 --> 04:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
dictated all discussion and
 
04:31:58.710 --> 04:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
consideration of solid waste matters in
 
04:32:00.030 --> 04:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire one was the
 
04:32:02.469 --> 04:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause and the other
 
04:32:05.550 --> 04:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
was we have a landfill capacity crisis
 
04:32:07.590 --> 04:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
and that was pretty much the end of the
 
04:32:09.990 --> 04:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
discussion uh the waste management
 
04:32:12.910 --> 04:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
Council was essentially silent
 
04:32:15.510 --> 04:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
um a lot of vacancies particularly on
 
04:32:17.830 --> 04:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
the public interest side industry was
 
04:32:21.070 --> 04:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
heavily represented
 
04:32:23.670 --> 04:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
um the solid waste working group
 
04:32:25.149 --> 04:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
actually came out of a small study
 
04:32:28.109 --> 04:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
committee I believe of three members and
 
04:32:30.550 --> 04:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
they really changed the Paradigm that
 
04:32:32.510 --> 04:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
study committee of three people Karen
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
able I believe chairing um allowed us to
 
04:32:38.189 --> 04:32:38.199 align:start position:0%
open up the conversation and that was
 
04:32:40.229 --> 04:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
several years ago and we're still here
 
04:32:41.950 --> 04:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
and we're in a moment of opportunity
 
04:32:44.349 --> 04:32:44.359 align:start position:0%
right now to really make some some
 
04:32:47.590 --> 04:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
important changes in New Hampshire so uh
 
04:32:49.389 --> 04:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
the working group I've been really
 
04:32:51.109 --> 04:32:51.119 align:start position:0%
pleased with what they've done I try to
 
04:32:53.469 --> 04:32:53.479 align:start position:0%
attend remotely when I can uh it's
 
04:32:55.149 --> 04:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
fascinating watching Regulators the
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
regulated community and legislators um
 
04:33:01.590 --> 04:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
conversing but again um I would prefer
 
04:33:04.629 --> 04:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
to have a legislative study committee
 
04:33:07.869 --> 04:33:07.879 align:start position:0%
not a commission that's a big deal um
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
but I think a a study committee or a
 
04:33:12.070 --> 04:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of the ENA committee could
 
04:33:13.670 --> 04:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
be very useful right now and I would
 
04:33:15.470 --> 04:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
like to see it focused a little more
 
04:33:17.349 --> 04:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
generally in fact I very much like the
 
04:33:20.150 --> 04:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
language uh in this bill as presented
 
04:33:21.390 --> 04:33:21.400 align:start position:0%
and I think it could again be a
 
04:33:24.390 --> 04:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
breakpoint to move us to a new a new
 
04:33:27.869 --> 04:33:27.879 align:start position:0%
phase um one last thing and then I will
 
04:33:29.949 --> 04:33:29.959 align:start position:0%
let you move on to your next bill uh in
 
04:33:33.670 --> 04:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
2011 a commission actually uh prepared a
 
04:33:35.349 --> 04:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
comprehensive report on construction and
 
04:33:37.590 --> 04:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
demolition debris that's a big issue in
 
04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County right now um and this
 
04:33:44.310 --> 04:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
bill would allow us to talk about some
 
04:33:46.109 --> 04:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
of the things that need to happen before
 
04:33:48.709 --> 04:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire continues to move forward
 
04:33:49.990 --> 04:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
with how they are going to manage
 
04:33:51.869 --> 04:33:51.879 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris the
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
2011 commission came up with some
 
04:33:56.470 --> 04:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
excellent recommendations some of them
 
04:33:58.750 --> 04:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
have been implemented some have not but
 
04:34:00.551 --> 04:34:00.561 align:start position:0%
they changed the marketplace in New
 
04:34:02.670 --> 04:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and on the Eastern side of the
 
04:34:05.470 --> 04:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
state um private investment sort of
 
04:34:07.990 --> 04:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
brought us into the 20th century maybe
 
04:34:09.670 --> 04:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
into the beginning of the 21st century
 
04:34:11.709 --> 04:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
and they really through economic incent
 
04:34:14.349 --> 04:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
Ives are doing things much much better
 
04:34:16.109 --> 04:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
than what we used to be doing which was
 
04:34:19.949 --> 04:34:19.959 align:start position:0%
just mixed loads Mass waste um
 
04:34:23.230 --> 04:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
contamination was a real problem um so
 
04:34:25.230 --> 04:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
the management is getting better and it
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
needs we need to continue doing that so
 
04:34:29.429 --> 04:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
I would like to submit into the record a
 
04:34:32.269 --> 04:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
copy of that 2011 report and I will
 
04:34:34.470 --> 04:34:34.480 align:start position:0%

record for the record my name is Peter
 
04:35:10.310 --> 04:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
Schmidt I represent over W one uh which
 
04:35:12.390 --> 04:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
is Trafford 19
 
04:35:15.230 --> 04:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
um and and I can be very brief I
 
04:35:16.830 --> 04:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
actually served on this committee 20
 
04:35:19.990 --> 04:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
years ago um and I'm aware of the fact
 
04:35:21.629 --> 04:35:21.639 align:start position:0%
that that you are currently wrestling
 
04:35:25.269 --> 04:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
with a number of very significant issues
 
04:35:27.750 --> 04:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh I I know many of you not all of you
 
04:35:30.189 --> 04:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
but I know many of you and I know that
 
04:35:32.830 --> 04:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uh willingness and
 
04:35:36.551 --> 04:35:36.561 align:start position:0%
Readiness to uh attack these very
 
04:35:39.990 --> 04:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
important issues and this is one of
 
04:35:43.150 --> 04:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
them uh it without a doubt and you
 
04:35:45.150 --> 04:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
should not be deterred by the fact that
 
04:35:48.230 --> 04:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
the bill does not specify which one of
 
04:35:53.349 --> 04:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
the certain uh materials uh you should
 
04:35:55.949 --> 04:35:55.959 align:start position:0%
study uh that is the fault of the
 
04:35:59.429 --> 04:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
drafters that they did not uh adhere to
 
04:36:02.709 --> 04:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
the request of the sponsor to be more
 
04:36:05.590 --> 04:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
specific but in any case this bill is a
 
04:36:08.189 --> 04:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle that you can use in any way you
 
04:36:10.949 --> 04:36:10.959 align:start position:0%
see fit in this General topic and this
 
04:36:15.189 --> 04:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
is uh one of the most serious aspects so
 
04:36:18.910 --> 04:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
have at it um this this study bill gives
 
04:36:22.070 --> 04:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
you the option to look into things that
 
04:36:23.910 --> 04:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
the sponsors may not have been aware
 
04:36:26.551 --> 04:36:26.561 align:start position:0%
that you're currently dealing with but
 
04:36:28.510 --> 04:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
there there's a lot of intellect in on
 
04:36:31.150 --> 04:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
this Committee just among the people I
 
04:36:33.949 --> 04:36:33.959 align:start position:0%
know and I'm sure the others are also
 
04:36:37.230 --> 04:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
equally gifted in terms of dealing with
 
04:36:38.910 --> 04:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
these serious
 
04:36:41.109 --> 04:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
issues uh because that's that's the
 
04:36:44.789 --> 04:36:44.799 align:start position:0%
reality this these plastic bags are only
 
04:36:47.830 --> 04:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
the the one we've talked about most in
 
04:36:51.510 --> 04:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
this particular hearing but uh but it is
 
04:36:54.029 --> 04:36:54.039 align:start position:0%
something that is not sufficiently
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
understood we we are only beginning to
 
04:37:00.429 --> 04:37:00.439 align:start position:0%
grasp the the depth of U of the the
 
04:37:03.670 --> 04:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
problem that that plastic bags and their
 
04:37:07.629 --> 04:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
disposal represent so please uh have at
 
04:37:09.869 --> 04:37:09.879 align:start position:0%
it as I say thank you very much I'll
 
04:37:11.990 --> 04:37:12.000 align:start position:0%

04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none I made myself
 
04:37:18.400 --> 04:37:20.269 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none I made myself
clear

04:37:20.269 --> 04:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:37:24.029 --> 04:37:24.039 align:start position:0%
yeah as you usually
 
04:37:26.910 --> 04:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
do uh and I don't see any other pink
 
04:37:30.109 --> 04:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
cards may I have the blue sheet uh I see
 
04:37:34.990 --> 04:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
on the uh online portal we have 148
 
04:37:39.470 --> 04:37:39.480 align:start position:0%

opposition were saying that the uh Focus
 
04:37:56.670 --> 04:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
was too
 
04:38:01.390 --> 04:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
broad so but anyway um we have one

sure uh representative kto has a
 
04:42:59.230 --> 04:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
question for you uh thank you madam
 
04:43:02.150 --> 04:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative um
 
04:43:04.990 --> 04:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things you mentioned in your
 
04:43:07.110 --> 04:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
testimony uh that you were saying was
 
04:43:08.708 --> 04:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
that there was going to be
 
04:43:11.230 --> 04:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
increases um it looks like there's going
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
to be increases in the amount of
 
04:43:16.948 --> 04:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
reimbursement but an overall
 
04:43:21.868 --> 04:43:21.878 align:start position:0%
decrease in the um amounts charged per
 
04:43:25.030 --> 04:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
gallon is that correct there there was a
 
04:43:27.990 --> 04:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
quite a study done um that we had to we
 
04:43:30.350 --> 04:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
brought people in for that and some
 
04:43:32.910 --> 04:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
increase some
 
04:43:35.948 --> 04:43:35.958 align:start position:0%
decrease follow follow with the purpose
 
04:43:37.628 --> 04:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
of having it you know with the amounts
 
04:43:39.990 --> 04:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
that are used of those particular items
 
04:43:41.708 --> 04:43:41.718 align:start position:0%
uh so that we do actually collect more
 
04:43:46.030 --> 04:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
money total at the end okay um
 
04:43:49.788 --> 04:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
so this would only be so I'm looking at
 
04:43:52.030 --> 04:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
this and I'm looking okay onroad and
 
04:43:54.390 --> 04:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
off-road diesel uh is going to decrease
 
04:43:59.430 --> 04:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
by 0.0001 cents per gallon um but then
 
04:44:02.830 --> 04:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
there was a line here that says let me
 
04:44:04.510 --> 04:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
just uh so you know what line I'm

about
 
04:44:11.670 --> 04:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
was uh there'll be an increase per fuel
 
04:44:14.550 --> 04:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
oil diesel products and used oil for on
 
04:44:16.750 --> 04:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
premise heating can you tell me what
 
04:44:20.110 --> 04:44:20.120 align:start position:0%

04:44:22.470 --> 04:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
increase and when I see Home Heating I
 
04:44:23.670 --> 04:44:23.680 align:start position:0%

really know what it is uh in a minute
 
04:45:01.830 --> 04:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid I already told you uh
 
04:45:03.350 --> 04:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
probably more than I know but I can tell

representative comp was I'm just a
 
04:45:15.550 --> 04:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
little bit I wanted a little

clarification of of the changes in the
 
04:45:20.750 --> 04:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
fees uh sounds like that you are not may
 
04:45:22.868 --> 04:45:22.878 align:start position:0%
not be the best person to it would be
 
04:45:25.990 --> 04:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
correct to to say to uh ask that
 
04:45:29.110 --> 04:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
question of someone following you uh yes
 
04:45:31.110 --> 04:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
it definitely would be and I I believe I
 
04:45:33.708 --> 04:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
kind of indicated that to begin with but

oh you're welcome
 
04:45:43.628 --> 04:45:43.638 align:start position:0%

I'm sorry grber like what yes uh thank
 
04:45:49.470 --> 04:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
you uh Madam chair uh thank you for
 
04:45:53.190 --> 04:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
testifying I had I looked at the um the
 
04:45:56.030 --> 04:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
estimated roughly $17 million of income
 
04:46:00.830 --> 04:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
from these fees um and the cost uh for
 
04:46:03.948 --> 04:46:03.958 align:start position:0%
providing oil tank uh removal and for
 
04:46:05.628 --> 04:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
those who can't afford it and that adds
 
04:46:09.910 --> 04:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
up to roughly $1 or2 million so uh where
 
04:46:11.590 --> 04:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
do the rest of revenues in end up going
 
04:46:11.600 --> 04:46:13.868 align:start position:0%
do the rest of revenues in end up going
into

04:46:13.868 --> 04:46:13.878 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:46:18.550 --> 04:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
State there there is a um a formula it's
 
04:46:21.110 --> 04:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
used for that certain amount is
 
04:46:23.190 --> 04:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
collected and it's it it's deposited in
 
04:46:25.110 --> 04:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
one place and then after that it's used
 
04:46:29.070 --> 04:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
so um is it all used on on remediation
 
04:46:31.270 --> 04:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
work or is it used for
 
04:46:34.670 --> 04:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
other some goes into the I believe uh
 
04:46:36.590 --> 04:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
and that can be asked in a minute into
 
04:46:40.430 --> 04:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
the the general fund but the stuff there
 
04:46:42.910 --> 04:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
is a good portion of it is used to
 
04:46:44.150 --> 04:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
actually do the
 
04:46:46.910 --> 04:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
remediation uh of of spills and things
 
04:46:49.948 --> 04:46:49.958 align:start position:0%
and also there's the part in here where
 
04:46:51.548 --> 04:46:51.558 align:start position:0%
if somebody's having an oil tank that's
 
04:46:53.190 --> 04:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
getting ready to go bad where you can
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
actually replace it before it goes bad
 
04:46:57.948 --> 04:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
which is you know a pretty good
 
04:47:00.910 --> 04:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
idea thank you okay any other questions
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for coming and
 
04:47:05.548 --> 04:47:05.558 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill um B Bishop from
 
04:47:07.548 --> 04:47:07.558 align:start position:0%
NHD New Hampshire Department of
 
04:47:20.708 --> 04:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:23.190 --> 04:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and committee
 
04:47:25.310 --> 04:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
members my name is Bob Bishop I am the
 
04:47:27.430 --> 04:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
administrator of the oil remediation and
 
04:47:30.310 --> 04:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
compliance Bureau at New Hampshire Dees
 
04:47:32.990 --> 04:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
seated with me is Jennifer Marts she is
 
04:47:36.548 --> 04:47:36.558 align:start position:0%
the supervisor of our fund management
 
04:47:39.590 --> 04:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
section the oil fund dispersement Board
 
04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
of which representative Edgar is a
 
04:47:44.948 --> 04:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
member is administratively attached in
 
04:47:46.230 --> 04:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
statute to the Department of
 
04:47:48.310 --> 04:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services it's part of that
 
04:47:50.670 --> 04:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
administrative attachment we have a fund
 
04:47:52.510 --> 04:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
management section Jennifer is the
 
04:47:56.948 --> 04:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
supervisor of that section that oversees
 
04:47:58.868 --> 04:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
the use of the funds on behalf of the
 
04:48:02.230 --> 04:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
board so the oil fund dispersement board
 
04:48:04.350 --> 04:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
decides how these funds are to be used
 
04:48:06.270 --> 04:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
and then Jennifer implements that
 
04:48:08.470 --> 04:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
portion of the
 
04:48:11.830 --> 04:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
program this bill impacts the oil
 
04:48:14.310 --> 04:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
discharge and Disposal cleanup fund
 
04:48:16.110 --> 04:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
representative Edgar just mentioned it
 
04:48:19.030 --> 04:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
also has some impact on the oil
 
04:48:20.948 --> 04:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
Pollution Control fund which is a
 
04:48:23.788 --> 04:48:23.798 align:start position:0%
separate fund that is managed by the
 
04:48:26.430 --> 04:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services so
 
04:48:28.510 --> 04:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
as he mentioned that the bill makes four
 
04:48:30.910 --> 04:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
changes and those changes are in both
 
04:48:35.190 --> 04:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
146d and that is the the statute that
 
04:48:37.910 --> 04:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
governs the oil discharge and disposable
 
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
cleanup fund and the oil fund board
 
04:48:45.150 --> 04:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
and in 146a which the oil spill
 
04:48:46.788 --> 04:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
Pollution Control
 
04:48:49.430 --> 04:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
Act those changes as you mentioned one
 
04:48:51.590 --> 04:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
is to change the date of due date of an
 
04:48:54.670 --> 04:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
annual report the other is to raise that
 
04:48:57.830 --> 04:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
cap on reimbursement for substandard
 
04:49:00.030 --> 04:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
tanks for lowincome
 
04:49:04.070 --> 04:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
homeowners the third extends the the
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
collection of the fees for the oil
 
04:49:08.470 --> 04:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
discharge and Disposal cleanup fund for
 
04:49:11.310 --> 04:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
an additional 10 years and includes a
 
04:49:14.310 --> 04:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
10year sunset of the collection of those
 
04:49:17.390 --> 04:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
fees and the fourth readjusts the fees
 
04:49:19.070 --> 04:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
which I understand there were some
 
04:49:22.868 --> 04:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
questions on a few moments
 
04:49:26.310 --> 04:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
ago and so the the odd fund we call it
 
04:49:28.350 --> 04:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
the oil discharge and Disposal cleanup
 
04:49:31.270 --> 04:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
fund primarily what it does is it
 
04:49:34.590 --> 04:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
reimburses for corrective action cleanup
 
04:49:39.350 --> 04:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
costs for spills from tank storage
 
04:49:42.150 --> 04:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
facilities where there is no insurance
 
04:49:43.910 --> 04:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
to pay for that cleanup so it's
 
04:49:46.310 --> 04:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
basically an excess insurance and that's
 
04:49:48.670 --> 04:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
where the primary expenditure of that
 
04:49:52.470 --> 04:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
money goes to probably around the order
 
04:49:56.590 --> 04:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
of $1 million a year is spent on cleanup
 
04:49:57.910 --> 04:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
of oil
 
04:50:00.310 --> 04:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
spills a million dollars a year being
 
04:50:02.708 --> 04:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
spent on the program the safe tank
 
04:50:05.190 --> 04:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
program we call it where that replaces
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
those home heating oil
 
04:50:11.190 --> 04:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
tanks also the fund satisfies financial
 
04:50:13.270 --> 04:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility requirements that owners
 
04:50:16.270 --> 04:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
of underground storage tank systems have
 
04:50:18.990 --> 04:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
both federally and in State
 
04:50:22.868 --> 04:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
Statute that uh financial responsibility
 
04:50:24.830 --> 04:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
requirement is basically insurance that
 
04:50:26.948 --> 04:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
they have to have in order to have a gas
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
station or underground storage tank and
 
04:50:32.868 --> 04:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
when this fund was initially set up
 
04:50:34.548 --> 04:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
insurance for that was pretty difficult
 
04:50:37.510 --> 04:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
to obtain and that was recognized in in
 
04:50:39.070 --> 04:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
the statement by the general court in
 
04:50:43.590 --> 04:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
the purpose uh for the fund and so it's
 
04:50:47.150 --> 04:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
still also a a financial responsibility
 
04:50:50.070 --> 04:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism the oil Pollution Control fund
 
04:50:51.670 --> 04:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
the other one that I mentioned out of
 
04:50:54.190 --> 04:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
146a that is for the Department of
 
04:50:56.628 --> 04:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services spill response
 
04:51:00.110 --> 04:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
and prevention programs so that fund
 
04:51:04.590 --> 04:51:04.600 align:start position:0%
pays for a 24hour a day 7day per week
 
04:51:07.190 --> 04:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
spill response program that is run at
 
04:51:09.590 --> 04:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
04:51:13.150 --> 04:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
also for vention program regulation of
 
04:51:15.788 --> 04:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
those underground storage tanks such as
 
04:51:17.990 --> 04:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
at gas
 
04:51:20.350 --> 04:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
stations The Spill response program
 
04:51:23.830 --> 04:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
responds to about 300 petroleum spills a
 
04:51:27.310 --> 04:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
year and that varies from year to year
 
04:51:29.750 --> 04:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
and the the large portion of those are
 
04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
not what would be eligible under this
 
04:51:33.470 --> 04:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
odd fund the largest portion are motor
 
04:51:36.788 --> 04:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
vehicle accidents uh but we do respond
 
04:51:39.910 --> 04:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
to approximately 100 home heating oil
 
04:51:42.030 --> 04:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
releases year again that fluctuates from
 
04:51:45.390 --> 04:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
year to year and we also respond to
 
04:51:48.910 --> 04:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
releases from other uh sources and other
 
04:51:51.510 --> 04:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
tank systems although those releases are
 
04:51:54.270 --> 04:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
are less than 10 every year that we see
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
from those types of tank
 
04:52:00.070 --> 04:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
systems so I'd open it up to to
 
04:52:01.470 --> 04:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
questions I know there were a few
 
04:52:03.270 --> 04:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
already that Jennifer and I can probably
 
04:52:05.708 --> 04:52:05.718 align:start position:0%
answer for okay I I'll I'll start off
 
04:52:07.350 --> 04:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
with the questions and then we'll go
 
04:52:07.360 --> 04:52:09.310 align:start position:0%
with the questions and then we'll go
around

04:52:09.310 --> 04:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:52:12.350 --> 04:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm interested to know I mean you
 
04:52:16.070 --> 04:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:19.070 --> 04:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
01546 how are those numbers developed I
 
04:52:21.150 --> 04:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
mean why isn't it just uh you know two
 
04:52:24.628 --> 04:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
cents a gallon or whatever sure and and
 
04:52:26.750 --> 04:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
this comes on the recommendation of the
 
04:52:28.628 --> 04:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
oil fund dispersement board they put
 
04:52:30.830 --> 04:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
this together and this is based on an
 
04:52:33.230 --> 04:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
Actuarial review that they had performed
 
04:52:36.110 --> 04:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
of the fund a company called Taylor and
 
04:52:39.110 --> 04:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
Moulder performed an Actuarial review
 
04:52:42.390 --> 04:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
for the board and what they were looking
 
04:52:45.510 --> 04:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
at for these different categories of
 
04:52:49.948 --> 04:52:49.958 align:start position:0%
petroleum that's imported is the cost in
 
04:52:53.430 --> 04:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
those types of categories that we have
 
04:52:56.150 --> 04:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
corrective action cleanup and they
 
04:52:59.628 --> 04:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
sought to as balance as best as possible
 
04:53:04.310 --> 04:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
for the import fees on gas and Diesel to
 
04:53:06.708 --> 04:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
pay for gas and Diesel releases the
 
04:53:09.910 --> 04:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
import fees for fuel oil to pay for
 
04:53:13.230 --> 04:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
those hea oil releases the import fees
 
04:53:15.910 --> 04:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
for motor oil to pay for the motor oil
 
04:53:18.470 --> 04:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
releases and so they were looking to
 
04:53:21.150 --> 04:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
balance as best as possible and the
 
04:53:24.110 --> 04:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
Actuarial firm came up with these
 
04:53:26.510 --> 04:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
numbers that go out to quite a few
 
04:53:29.670 --> 04:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
digits and the board decided to leave it
 
04:53:32.310 --> 04:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
as such as opposed to trunk creating it
 
04:53:36.270 --> 04:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
to a more round number that could be
 
04:53:38.948 --> 04:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
easier to use that was a board
 
04:53:42.110 --> 04:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
decision okay represent Bixby yes thank
 
04:53:45.788 --> 04:53:45.798 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so uh sort of
 
04:53:49.070 --> 04:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
following up on that uh I noticed that
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
some of these numbers have some of these
 
04:53:53.590 --> 04:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
fee numbers have gone down some of them
 
04:53:57.750 --> 04:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
have gone up is that um a result of a
 
04:54:00.548 --> 04:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
change in the uh calculated risk
 
04:54:04.708 --> 04:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
multiplied by the amount of uh of that
 
04:54:08.708 --> 04:54:08.718 align:start position:0%
type of uh oil that is being uh brought
 
04:54:13.230 --> 04:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
into the state the answer is yes that
 
04:54:14.990 --> 04:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
that is what that change is is
 
04:54:18.030 --> 04:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
predicated upon uh but it it really gets
 
04:54:20.150 --> 04:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
into the
 
04:54:22.750 --> 04:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
existing projects that we have so we
 
04:54:25.390 --> 04:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
have about 1,200 existing petroleum
 
04:54:26.830 --> 04:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
contaminated sites that we're
 
04:54:30.150 --> 04:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
administering to the cost of those over
 
04:54:33.868 --> 04:54:33.878 align:start position:0%
the next 10e period and any new releases
 
04:54:37.110 --> 04:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
that may occur over that period as well
 
04:54:39.150 --> 04:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
and then looking and that's where that
 
04:54:41.708 --> 04:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
part of the risk comes in looking at at
 
04:54:41.718 --> 04:54:43.110 align:start position:0%
part of the risk comes in looking at at
the

04:54:43.110 --> 04:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:46.070 --> 04:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
individual petroleum types that are
 
04:54:50.230 --> 04:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
feed follow up follow up yep so
 
04:54:53.430 --> 04:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
um do these have these fees been
 
04:54:57.310 --> 04:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
calculated essentially with a goal of uh
 
04:54:59.470 --> 04:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
generating a balance in the fund that is
 
04:55:01.430 --> 04:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
going to that is very well matched
 
04:55:05.070 --> 04:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
towards the ex known and expected
 
04:55:07.990 --> 04:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
costs the the the idea would be for it
 
04:55:10.150 --> 04:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
to match exactly to that but it's so
 
04:55:12.230 --> 04:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
hard hard to predict you know out 10
 
04:55:14.868 --> 04:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
years in the future but yes that is if
 
04:55:16.310 --> 04:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
you could match something 12 10 years
 
04:55:17.470 --> 04:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
out in the
 
04:55:20.590 --> 04:55:20.600 align:start position:0%
future you'd have a good career in a lot
 
04:55:22.030 --> 04:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
of other
 
04:55:24.350 --> 04:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
Industries so that is that is the
 
04:55:27.190 --> 04:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
purpose okay thank
 
04:55:31.110 --> 04:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
you uh representative K thank you madam
 
04:55:33.750 --> 04:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here um
 
04:55:34.948 --> 04:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to follow up on one of
 
04:55:36.628 --> 04:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
the questions that I asked um
 
04:55:36.638 --> 04:55:37.948 align:start position:0%
the questions that I asked um
specifically

04:55:37.948 --> 04:55:37.958 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
04:55:43.670 --> 04:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
online 19 um in 20 um we're doing a
 
04:55:45.910 --> 04:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
decrease on on-road and off-road
 
04:55:48.070 --> 04:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
gasoline and diesel fuel but we're doing
 
04:55:51.030 --> 04:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
an increase per gallon of fuel oil
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
diesel products and used oil for on
 
04:55:55.750 --> 04:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
premise heating can you tell me what the
 
04:55:58.110 --> 04:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
fuel oil diesel products and used oil
 
04:56:01.110 --> 04:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
for onome what that is yes please I'm
 
04:56:05.190 --> 04:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
just yes and so that category
 
04:56:07.548 --> 04:56:07.558 align:start position:0%
represents fuel that's used for heating
 
04:56:10.270 --> 04:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
purposes so all of those items so in
 
04:56:13.350 --> 04:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
includes home heating oil the board
 
04:56:15.830 --> 04:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
during their October meeting and when
 
04:56:18.390 --> 04:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
they decided what they would land on
 
04:56:23.910 --> 04:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
here um recommended that the fee from
 
04:56:27.430 --> 04:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
the current fee on that be essentially
 
04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
doubled the Actuarial review landed on a
 
04:56:34.708 --> 04:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
much higher amount because we do have
 
04:56:37.150 --> 04:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
quite a bit as I mentioned we do about a
 
04:56:39.110 --> 04:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
100 home eating oil releases our spill
 
04:56:41.948 --> 04:56:41.958 align:start position:0%
response team goes to to every year and
 
04:56:45.510 --> 04:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
so that is a category that continues to
 
04:56:47.470 --> 04:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
have a number of
 
04:56:52.230 --> 04:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
releases and that gets more to fuel oil
 
04:56:54.110 --> 04:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
paying for the releases that come from
 
04:56:57.150 --> 04:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
fuel oil tanks as opposed to the gas and
 
04:56:59.948 --> 04:56:59.958 align:start position:0%
Diesel paying for it the gas and Diesel
 
04:57:02.670 --> 04:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
is the largest on volume that gets
 
04:57:04.628 --> 04:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
imported to the state so when you look
 
04:57:06.750 --> 04:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
at these numbers it's really that number
 
04:57:10.190 --> 04:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
times the gallons that give you what the
 
04:57:13.110 --> 04:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
the financial impact is and so that
 
04:57:15.830 --> 04:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
number um really has to go with that
 
04:57:19.070 --> 04:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
gallon to really make sense follow up
 
04:57:21.230 --> 04:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:57:23.948 --> 04:57:23.958 align:start position:0%
that exp that explanation
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
um so my other question to you is is
 
04:57:29.628 --> 04:57:29.638 align:start position:0%
this is just on
 
04:57:29.638 --> 04:57:31.150 align:start position:0%
this is just on
imported

04:57:31.150 --> 04:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
imported
 
04:57:35.390 --> 04:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
fuel um as opposed to I mean when we say
 
04:57:37.628 --> 04:57:37.638 align:start position:0%
imported do we mean what exactly do we
 
04:57:41.430 --> 04:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
mean because it looks like um
 
04:57:43.030 --> 04:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
can you just explain that to me please
 
04:57:45.070 --> 04:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
because it was pretty sure so that
 
04:57:47.990 --> 04:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's petroleum that is coming into the
 
04:57:51.070 --> 04:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
state for primarily for use with or
 
04:57:54.628 --> 04:57:54.638 align:start position:0%
storage within the state and so any that
 
04:57:56.270 --> 04:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
comes into the state it's going to be
 
04:57:58.990 --> 04:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
used here that's what these apply to oil
 
04:58:01.350 --> 04:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
that's passing through the state this
 
04:58:04.390 --> 04:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply but it's oil imported into
 
04:58:06.910 --> 04:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the other okay one more
 
04:58:12.788 --> 04:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
followup I need two but okay um H the so
 
04:58:16.030 --> 04:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
technically all fuel I I'm making an
 
04:58:17.470 --> 04:58:17.480 align:start position:0%
assumption here and correct me if I'm
 
04:58:19.628 --> 04:58:19.638 align:start position:0%
wrong is imported into the state of New
 
04:58:21.430 --> 04:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would that be correct that is
 
04:58:23.030 --> 04:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
correct although some fuel passes
 
04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
through that's why I was making that
 
04:58:27.670 --> 04:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
distinction yes right so would these
 
04:58:29.708 --> 04:58:29.718 align:start position:0%
costs especially on the home heating
 
04:58:32.590 --> 04:58:32.600 align:start position:0%
fuel be passed on to the
 
04:58:35.070 --> 04:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
consumer uh I'm I'm not part of the
 
04:58:37.350 --> 04:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
industry so I'm not sure how they manage
 
04:58:41.670 --> 04:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
that U but an assumption would yes but
 
04:58:44.470 --> 04:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not part of that okay um we had
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative King and then down to
 
04:58:49.910 --> 04:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:58:51.628 --> 04:58:51.638 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
04:58:54.310 --> 04:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
today um I have a very slight background
 
04:58:57.590 --> 04:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
in computer programming and in computer
 
04:59:00.030 --> 04:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
programming um when you have just hard
 
04:59:01.990 --> 04:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
numbers that are in the code that's
 
04:59:05.190 --> 04:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's called a magic number and one of
 
04:59:07.350 --> 04:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
the things that just makes me scratch my
 
04:59:09.190 --> 04:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
head a little bit is that all of these
 
04:59:13.110 --> 04:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
numbers in here the dollar amounts um
 
04:59:16.430 --> 04:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
you know I can imagine that over time
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
with inflation at say 10 or
 
04:59:21.910 --> 04:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
15% and you guys are projecting out
 
04:59:23.788 --> 04:59:23.798 align:start position:0%
several years I'm just wondering did you
 
04:59:26.830 --> 04:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
guys put you know bake into the formula
 
04:59:32.548 --> 04:59:32.558 align:start position:0%
a 10 or 15% inflation rate and if not um
 
04:59:34.990 --> 04:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
you know I think one of the problems I
 
04:59:36.590 --> 04:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
have with magic numbers is the fact that
 
04:59:38.788 --> 04:59:38.798 align:start position:0%
they so frequently need to be changed
 
04:59:40.708 --> 04:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
and to me I
 
04:59:42.830 --> 04:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
I don't want future legislators to have
 
04:59:45.990 --> 04:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
to come in every year or two and like go
 
04:59:47.708 --> 04:59:47.718 align:start position:0%
over this whole process again just to
 
04:59:50.510 --> 04:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
change numbers it seems like a better
 
04:59:53.230 --> 04:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
way now I don't know but it seems like a
 
04:59:55.788 --> 04:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
better way would just be like a formula
 
04:59:58.868 --> 04:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
that were put into the code so that you
 
05:00:01.030 --> 05:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
know you guys could do what you need to
 
05:00:05.430 --> 05:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
do and that formula basically is static
 
05:00:07.030 --> 05:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
and it just stays the same for years and
 
05:00:08.708 --> 05:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
years so that you guys aren't having to
 
05:00:10.750 --> 05:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
come back here every few years to like
 
05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
change numbers again am I missing
 
05:00:17.708 --> 05:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
something I'm I'm not sure I I will
 
05:00:20.548 --> 05:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
address that the Actuarial review
 
05:00:24.190 --> 05:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
included a 2% adjustment for inflation
 
05:00:25.350 --> 05:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
right year-over-year
 
05:00:28.470 --> 05:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
um regarding whether this could be done
 
05:00:28.480 --> 05:00:29.670 align:start position:0%
um regarding whether this could be done
with

05:00:29.670 --> 05:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:00:32.788 --> 05:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
a with a formula placed into the statute
 
05:00:34.868 --> 05:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
it's not something we've considered it
 
05:00:36.670 --> 05:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't something that we had to go on
 
05:00:38.990 --> 05:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
historically what we have had is is a
 
05:00:40.868 --> 05:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
10-year sunset
 
05:00:44.070 --> 05:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
in order to force us to look at what
 
05:00:45.868 --> 05:00:45.878 align:start position:0%
these fees will be and of course the
 
05:00:49.390 --> 05:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
board can reassess what their fees are
 
05:00:52.548 --> 05:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
and look for future legislation before
 
05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
that 10year time period is up that
 
05:00:58.230 --> 05:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened in the last 10 years so
 
05:01:01.510 --> 05:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
we go back to 2015 when the last change
 
05:01:01.520 --> 05:01:02.750 align:start position:0%
we go back to 2015 when the last change
was

05:01:02.750 --> 05:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:01:05.910 --> 05:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
made follow up yet okay so since it it's
 
05:01:07.548 --> 05:01:07.558 align:start position:0%
been 10 years did you find that there
 
05:01:09.548 --> 05:01:09.558 align:start position:0%
was any shortfall like because you guys
 
05:01:11.590 --> 05:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
originally had these numbers and
 
05:01:13.350 --> 05:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
inflation I think has been a lot higher
 
05:01:16.390 --> 05:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
than 2% annually in the last 10 years
 
05:01:18.510 --> 05:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering did you guys find out
 
05:01:20.350 --> 05:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
that your projections were way under
 
05:01:23.948 --> 05:01:23.958 align:start position:0%
budget or did it come out just right so
 
05:01:26.230 --> 05:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
using the the the fees have been
 
05:01:28.070 --> 05:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
adjusted here and it and it is I did
 
05:01:29.670 --> 05:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
hear earlier there was a question
 
05:01:32.510 --> 05:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
overall it's an 8% increase that it
 
05:01:35.548 --> 05:01:35.558 align:start position:0%
represents I know it's hard to see that
 
05:01:36.788 --> 05:01:36.798 align:start position:0%
with these because there's all these
 
05:01:39.270 --> 05:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
different fees uh for different types of
 
05:01:39.280 --> 05:01:40.548 align:start position:0%
different fees uh for different types of
petroleum

05:01:40.548 --> 05:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
petroleum
 
05:01:43.270 --> 05:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
um so there is an 8% overall increase
 
05:01:45.548 --> 05:01:45.558 align:start position:0%
and that was why the board hired the
 
05:01:50.190 --> 05:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
Actuarial firm to review what our
 
05:01:53.070 --> 05:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
liabilities versus our income might be
 
05:01:55.470 --> 05:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
over the next 10e time frame and they
 
05:01:59.270 --> 05:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
did find with current fees that we would
 
05:02:02.590 --> 05:02:02.600 align:start position:0%
end up with a negative balance I think
 
05:02:04.590 --> 05:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
it was by year seven
 
05:02:06.590 --> 05:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
or8 by
 
05:02:10.390 --> 05:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
2034 we would not have a fun
 
05:02:13.470 --> 05:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
existing for what was the perceived
 
05:02:15.030 --> 05:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
liability still
 
05:02:18.910 --> 05:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
existing and so this 8% increase enables
 
05:02:21.150 --> 05:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
the fund
 
05:02:26.350 --> 05:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
to essentially have a a year or a half a
 
05:02:30.548 --> 05:02:30.558 align:start position:0%
year of liabilities covered when it
 
05:02:33.708 --> 05:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
sunsets okay representative wheeler
 
05:02:36.030 --> 05:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh this should be
 
05:02:38.670 --> 05:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
a much simpler question than the others
 
05:02:43.510 --> 05:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
um on line four you changed the uh date
 
05:02:44.948 --> 05:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
of the report to the governor and
 
05:02:48.190 --> 05:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
Council the Speaker of the House Etc to
 
05:02:51.110 --> 05:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
from October 1 to March one uh can you
 
05:02:52.990 --> 05:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
just elaborate on that a little B more
 
05:02:57.390 --> 05:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
sure October 1st was a difficulty both
 
05:03:00.548 --> 05:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
for the administrative faction of the of
 
05:03:02.990 --> 05:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
the board so the the agency to get all
 
05:03:06.510 --> 05:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
of the previous years's fiscal fiscal
 
05:03:09.150 --> 05:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
year ending numbers together and put
 
05:03:12.190 --> 05:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
together in package for the board for
 
05:03:15.628 --> 05:03:15.638 align:start position:0%
the annual report and then also to have
 
05:03:17.990 --> 05:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
a board meeting where they could review
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
that have a discussion on it and approve
 
05:03:23.390 --> 05:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
that that annual report gets moved
 
05:03:25.990 --> 05:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
forward so is it a combination of of how
 
05:03:27.670 --> 05:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
close that was to the end of the fiscal
 
05:03:30.628 --> 05:03:30.638 align:start position:0%
year and basically our accounting unit
 
05:03:32.750 --> 05:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
having to put together end of year and
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
beginning of your numbers in time for a
 
05:03:39.350 --> 05:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
board meeting and so that board meeting
 
05:03:41.830 --> 05:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
would have had to in August would have
 
05:03:43.670 --> 05:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
been pushing that to get that to
 
05:03:46.750 --> 05:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
governor and councel by October
 
05:03:48.750 --> 05:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
1st representative
 
05:03:51.910 --> 05:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
Bixby am I correct in recalling that uh
 
05:03:54.628 --> 05:03:54.638 align:start position:0%
we had an amendment put on to some other
 
05:03:57.270 --> 05:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
bill in the last uh two or three years
 
05:04:00.990 --> 05:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
to increase the reimbursement for uh
 
05:04:04.150 --> 05:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
tank upgrades because what was had been
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
the case wasn't the case yes that is
 
05:04:10.910 --> 05:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
correct uh believe it was in
 
05:04:14.750 --> 05:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
2022 that uh that came uh before the
 
05:04:17.390 --> 05:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
legislature and that was to increase the
 
05:04:20.868 --> 05:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
safe tank so that the reimbursement for
 
05:04:24.270 --> 05:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
financial qualified homeowners to
 
05:04:26.868 --> 05:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
receive uh a new heating oil tank when
 
05:04:29.830 --> 05:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's a substandard follow follow up
 
05:04:31.910 --> 05:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
yep and then seem that that seem that
 
05:04:34.430 --> 05:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
seems to suggest that if the numbers
 
05:04:37.230 --> 05:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
don't work out uh if if the 10-year
 
05:04:38.628 --> 05:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
projection doesn't work out there's a
 
05:04:41.628 --> 05:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
way to deal with it is that correct the
 
05:04:44.150 --> 05:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
the board could always request
 
05:04:46.788 --> 05:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
additional legislation to deal with that
 
05:04:50.030 --> 05:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you okay and U my apologies
 
05:04:51.708 --> 05:04:51.718 align:start position:0%
representative Scully I should have
 
05:04:54.350 --> 05:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
gotten you in the queue earlier but go
 
05:04:56.430 --> 05:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
ahead and ask a question thank thank you
 
05:04:58.910 --> 05:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair no no problem um the
 
05:05:03.788 --> 05:05:03.798 align:start position:0%
legislation on lines 19 um 22 and 23
 
05:05:05.868 --> 05:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
says the department shall of safety
 
05:05:10.470 --> 05:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
shall deposit into the um 125 ,000 in
 
05:05:12.670 --> 05:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
fees paid to the general fund is that a
 
05:05:14.510 --> 05:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
requirement of
 
05:05:14.520 --> 05:05:16.390 align:start position:0%
requirement of
law

05:05:16.390 --> 05:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:05:19.830 --> 05:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
so that has been within the statute for
 
05:05:23.310 --> 05:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
quite a quite a few years and I'm I'm
 
05:05:23.320 --> 05:05:24.070 align:start position:0%
quite a quite a few years and I'm I'm
not

05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:05:27.350 --> 05:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
sure exactly why that's required perhaps
 
05:05:29.868 --> 05:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
there is an administrative statute that
 
05:05:31.750 --> 05:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
requires some amount to go into the
 
05:05:34.750 --> 05:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
general fund but uh we we left that the
 
05:05:37.350 --> 05:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
same as it is in the current
 
05:05:39.990 --> 05:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
statute and the Department of Safety is
 
05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
is who collects these
 
05:05:45.070 --> 05:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
fees and then they move them over into
 
05:05:48.510 --> 05:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
the the the two different funds that we
 
05:05:50.990 --> 05:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
were talking about all right just just
 
05:05:53.628 --> 05:05:53.638 align:start position:0%
want quick follow up S all right
 
05:05:56.830 --> 05:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
so which uh statute does that requires
 
05:05:59.350 --> 05:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
that is that uh one you're amending
 
05:06:01.548 --> 05:06:01.558 align:start position:0%
here so that was put in the original La
 
05:06:03.470 --> 05:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
statute that yes so the statute that's
 
05:06:05.948 --> 05:06:05.958 align:start position:0%
being amended here is where that
 
05:06:07.788 --> 05:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
$125,000 in
 
05:06:11.230 --> 05:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
fees was original
 
05:06:12.868 --> 05:06:12.878 align:start position:0%
listed all right thank
 
05:06:17.150 --> 05:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
you first goes so um do you have
 
05:06:19.390 --> 05:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
administrative Personnel in the
 
05:06:22.628 --> 05:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
department that uh are overseeing this
 
05:06:27.708 --> 05:06:27.718 align:start position:0%
that are not paid by the um paid by the
 
05:06:29.948 --> 05:06:29.958 align:start position:0%
direct directly from the
 
05:06:33.670 --> 05:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
fund oh all of our administrative
 
05:06:36.110 --> 05:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
Personnel that uh work on behalf of the
 
05:06:38.708 --> 05:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
board are paid from the fund okay so
 
05:06:40.470 --> 05:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
would that include you
 
05:06:42.948 --> 05:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
that and I I am paid out of the oil
 
05:06:45.708 --> 05:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
Pollution Control fund so that's okay
 
05:06:48.548 --> 05:06:48.558 align:start position:0%
one of the two right and and Jennifer's
 
05:06:50.150 --> 05:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
paid out of the other one because I was
 
05:06:51.510 --> 05:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
thinking there might be some general
 
05:06:53.390 --> 05:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
funded position that would be covered by
 
05:06:55.230 --> 05:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
that but I'm not that's that's look
 
05:06:57.990 --> 05:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
looking less clear so thank
 
05:07:02.230 --> 05:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
you okay and I have a question um if
 
05:07:05.470 --> 05:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
this bill were not to pass what would
 
05:07:10.948 --> 05:07:10.958 align:start position:0%
happen if this bill was not to pass then
 
05:07:15.070 --> 05:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
the the current fees would be sunset the
 
05:07:17.670 --> 05:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
fees for the oil Pollution Control fund
 
05:07:20.070 --> 05:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
would continue at the rate that they are
 
05:07:22.350 --> 05:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
at and so that would fund that spill
 
05:07:25.628 --> 05:07:25.638 align:start position:0%
response side of things and then there
 
05:07:28.788 --> 05:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be money for the the 12200 or
 
05:07:31.788 --> 05:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
so sites that we currently have that are
 
05:07:33.830 --> 05:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
contaminated that are going through some
 
05:07:37.190 --> 05:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
form of corrective action or groundwater
 
05:07:40.110 --> 05:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
monitoring um and so that that that
 
05:07:41.708 --> 05:07:41.718 align:start position:0%
money wouldn't exist and there also
 
05:07:43.110 --> 05:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
would not be
 
05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility mechanism for
 
05:07:48.510 --> 05:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
underground storage tank systems they
 
05:07:50.350 --> 05:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
would have to go out and seek their own
 
05:07:52.390 --> 05:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism in order to continue to
 
05:07:57.788 --> 05:07:57.798 align:start position:0%
operate those systems okay and just as a
 
05:08:02.110 --> 05:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
followup how much does it cost for all
 
05:08:05.548 --> 05:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
the um remediation work and that you
 
05:08:07.590 --> 05:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
said that you wouldn't have money to do
 
05:08:09.868 --> 05:08:09.878 align:start position:0%
that what what does that cost and ually
 
05:08:13.470 --> 05:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
so annually um we get we have
 
05:08:16.150 --> 05:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
appropriated by the legislature 122.5
 
05:08:19.390 --> 05:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
million to use for that reimbursement of
 
05:08:22.150 --> 05:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
those corrective actions and that also
 
05:08:24.948 --> 05:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
includes that safe tank program the tank
 
05:08:28.788 --> 05:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
replacement so about 11.5 million goes
 
05:08:31.430 --> 05:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
right to actual
 
05:08:33.990 --> 05:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
remediation work or groundwater
 
05:08:37.230 --> 05:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring work or work to uh to
 
05:08:41.190 --> 05:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
investigate um where in the subsurface
 
05:08:43.628 --> 05:08:43.638 align:start position:0%
that petroleum might be and what it may
 
05:08:46.310 --> 05:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
impact and so that wouldn't wouldn't
 
05:08:50.670 --> 05:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
happen necessarily without this funding
 
05:08:53.948 --> 05:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
05:08:57.350 --> 05:08:57.360 align:start position:0%

05:09:40.230 --> 05:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
say because we I own a p distribution
 
05:09:42.190 --> 05:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
company that supplies independent
 
05:09:46.510 --> 05:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
gasoline uh owners uh in throughout the
 
05:09:48.030 --> 05:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
New England states including New
 
05:09:51.430 --> 05:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Vermont Massachusetts so I I'm
 
05:09:52.948 --> 05:09:52.958 align:start position:0%
on both sides of this from the
 
05:09:54.948 --> 05:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
perspective of I understand what benefit
 
05:09:57.830 --> 05:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
this program is created for individual
 
05:09:59.948 --> 05:09:59.958 align:start position:0%
owners and how individual communities
 
05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
have been benefactors of this fund and
 
05:10:04.990 --> 05:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
how it's functioned and the uh Madam
 
05:10:06.510 --> 05:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
chair you you brought up a really great
 
05:10:07.910 --> 05:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
question that said what happens if this
 
05:10:10.110 --> 05:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
fund doesn't exist anymore and the
 
05:10:12.310 --> 05:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
reason it was created is private
 
05:10:14.110 --> 05:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
insurance just didn't exist and what
 
05:10:16.030 --> 05:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
ended up happening it wasn't major oil
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
companies that were the ones who were
 
05:10:21.310 --> 05:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for cleaning up individual
 
05:10:23.390 --> 05:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
small community gas station issues that
 
05:10:26.510 --> 05:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
arose it was the individual owners so
 
05:10:28.230 --> 05:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
these individual small community owners
 
05:10:29.628 --> 05:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
and we all have them there small country
 
05:10:31.708 --> 05:10:31.718 align:start position:0%
stores in our site in our communities
 
05:10:34.470 --> 05:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
and 70 or 80% of all these stations are
 
05:10:38.548 --> 05:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
privately held small individual U owners
 
05:10:40.910 --> 05:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
and so they would be responsible for
 
05:10:43.350 --> 05:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
paying the extreme cost associated with
 
05:10:45.548 --> 05:10:45.558 align:start position:0%
potentially cleaning up and creation of
 
05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
the fund is uh the previous speakers
 
05:10:50.670 --> 05:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
said also came with some caveats that
 
05:10:52.310 --> 05:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
said you got to be in compliance so you
 
05:10:53.868 --> 05:10:53.878 align:start position:0%
got to follow the rules you got to be
 
05:10:55.110 --> 05:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
educated you got to make sure that
 
05:10:56.628 --> 05:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
you're following these rules in order to
 
05:10:59.788 --> 05:10:59.798 align:start position:0%
be eligible for the fund so it worked
 
05:11:01.470 --> 05:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
and it's had it's worked very well for
 
05:11:03.868 --> 05:11:03.878 align:start position:0%
the last 20 plus years so I'm I'm here
 
05:11:05.948 --> 05:11:05.958 align:start position:0%
to just answer questions my testimony as
 
05:11:08.510 --> 05:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
chairman was uploaded earlier I'm not
 
05:11:09.788 --> 05:11:09.798 align:start position:0%
going to bore you with reading through
 
05:11:12.150 --> 05:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
it so if uh anyone has any questions I'd
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
be glad to answer representative wheeler
 
05:11:15.948 --> 05:11:15.958 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just an
 
05:11:15.958 --> 05:11:17.430 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just an
informational

05:11:17.430 --> 05:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
informational
 
05:11:20.070 --> 05:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
question where would one be able to
 
05:11:22.110 --> 05:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
research more about your board is are
 
05:11:24.110 --> 05:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
the minutes available online things like
 
05:11:26.430 --> 05:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
that yes they're available online it's
 
05:11:28.670 --> 05:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
the oil fund dispersement board and we
 
05:11:31.788 --> 05:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
meet uh uh probably every other month or
 
05:11:33.670 --> 05:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
once a quarter I think at this
 
05:11:36.190 --> 05:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
point and I have a question as to who
 
05:11:40.270 --> 05:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
determines who is a member of that board
 
05:11:42.390 --> 05:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
yeah the board is a is a collection of
 
05:11:45.430 --> 05:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
Representative Senators uh members from
 
05:11:46.868 --> 05:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
uh the Department of Environmental
 
05:11:49.548 --> 05:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
Services a couple of who you met here
 
05:11:51.990 --> 05:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
and also members of Industry so we have
 
05:11:53.910 --> 05:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
members representing the heating oil
 
05:11:56.230 --> 05:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
industry myself came on as a
 
05:11:59.628 --> 05:11:59.638 align:start position:0%
representative of the refiners and uh
 
05:12:02.110 --> 05:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
oil distributors who are the folks who
 
05:12:04.270 --> 05:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
pay all the import fees you know for all
 
05:12:06.230 --> 05:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
that oil and gasoline that gets imported
 
05:12:08.708 --> 05:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
into the state so I hope I think that
 
05:12:10.350 --> 05:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
answers the question so we've got a
 
05:12:12.708 --> 05:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
collection of uh subject matter experts
 
05:12:14.510 --> 05:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
from Private Industry and also from the
 
05:12:16.350 --> 05:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
05:12:18.948 --> 05:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
also the Senate and representatives okay
 
05:12:22.670 --> 05:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
and how uh just to uh Echo a question
 
05:12:26.190 --> 05:12:26.200 align:start position:0%
previously by representative ktoa um how
 
05:12:29.548 --> 05:12:29.558 align:start position:0%
does an increase in these fees affect
 
05:12:32.470 --> 05:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
the consumer what is that in the end
 
05:12:34.190 --> 05:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
well you got to talk a little bit about
 
05:12:36.150 --> 05:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
what's happening in our world right now
 
05:12:38.788 --> 05:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a significant reduction in
 
05:12:40.750 --> 05:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of heating oil being used out
 
05:12:42.628 --> 05:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
there and we're also seeing a reduction
 
05:12:44.350 --> 05:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
in the amount of gasoline and diesel
 
05:12:45.948 --> 05:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
fuel that's being used out there and
 
05:12:48.310 --> 05:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
that's as a result of of you know fuel
 
05:12:50.310 --> 05:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
economy the Advent of alternative
 
05:12:53.150 --> 05:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
Vehicles EVS uh heating oil equipment
 
05:12:55.070 --> 05:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's much more efficient so the net
 
05:12:57.430 --> 05:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
effect is the average consumers
 
05:12:59.788 --> 05:12:59.798 align:start position:0%
purchasing less hydrocarbons so as a
 
05:13:02.910 --> 05:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
result our fees and our actual study
 
05:13:05.070 --> 05:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
shows it based on you know Trends and
 
05:13:07.190 --> 05:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
projections that we're going to see less
 
05:13:09.868 --> 05:13:09.878 align:start position:0%
gallons okay coming in at as the basis
 
05:13:12.708 --> 05:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
for how this fund functions so that
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
means we have to come up with mechanisms
 
05:13:17.390 --> 05:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
to sort of meet that demand as we look
 
05:13:19.430 --> 05:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
into the future you know and I think it
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
was talked about where it's kind of a
 
05:13:23.830 --> 05:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
math somebody talked about being a math
 
05:13:26.070 --> 05:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
expert and I say you know when you look
 
05:13:28.628 --> 05:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
at an 8% fee increase especially in you
 
05:13:30.948 --> 05:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
know home heating oil that's a
 
05:13:32.868 --> 05:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
significant consideration but when you
 
05:13:34.470 --> 05:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
look at the fact that they're all using
 
05:13:36.788 --> 05:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
less gallons the total dollars that
 
05:13:38.590 --> 05:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
we're actually collecting is comparable
 
05:13:40.628 --> 05:13:40.638 align:start position:0%
to what the fund has been collecting all
 
05:13:42.590 --> 05:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
along because we're using so much less
 
05:13:45.150 --> 05:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
so it's a little bit of a you pay a
 
05:13:46.390 --> 05:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
little bit more per gallon but you're
 
05:13:47.830 --> 05:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
using less
 
05:13:50.750 --> 05:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
gallons okay any other questions from
 
05:13:50.760 --> 05:13:52.430 align:start position:0%
gallons okay any other questions from
the

05:13:52.430 --> 05:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:13:55.390 --> 05:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none oh well
 
05:13:57.510 --> 05:13:57.520 align:start position:0%

explaining this a little bit further uh
 
05:14:06.708 --> 05:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking on the fund is there a
 
05:14:10.230 --> 05:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
place where it lists the um
 
05:14:12.628 --> 05:14:12.638 align:start position:0%
members um I'm having difficulty and I
 
05:14:15.030 --> 05:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
didn't know if it was somewhere uh if
 
05:14:16.868 --> 05:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
that's right on the website I I believe
 
05:14:18.750 --> 05:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
it is on the website but I sure couldn't
 
05:14:20.868 --> 05:14:20.878 align:start position:0%

all

05:17:43.990 --> 05:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:17:46.590 --> 05:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
right thank you madam chair um for the
 
05:17:48.990 --> 05:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
record my name is representative Kelly
 
05:17:50.708 --> 05:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
Penza straford District
 
05:17:55.070 --> 05:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
19 Rochester Wards 1 two 3 four and six
 
05:17:58.548 --> 05:17:58.558 align:start position:0%
um sorry I had to present other bills
 
05:18:01.830 --> 05:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
and I filed too many bills this year
 
05:18:04.150 --> 05:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
been there done that we all know thank
 
05:18:05.430 --> 05:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
you so
 
05:18:08.510 --> 05:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
much so I'm not sure what did you say
 
05:18:13.590 --> 05:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:16.708 --> 05:18:16.718 align:start position:0%
no okay all
 
05:18:16.718 --> 05:18:19.070 align:start position:0%
no okay all
right

05:18:19.070 --> 05:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:18:21.750 --> 05:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
um okay so the reason why this bill came
 
05:18:26.628 --> 05:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
forward is um really due to being part
 
05:18:31.390 --> 05:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
of this rules process for um you know in
 
05:18:34.030 --> 05:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
a sense over a year
 
05:18:37.030 --> 05:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
and and then of course I was on the
 
05:18:40.628 --> 05:18:40.638 align:start position:0%
subcommittee here for rules as well and
 
05:18:43.750 --> 05:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
so um we lived and breed these rules
 
05:18:46.788 --> 05:18:46.798 align:start position:0%
during that whole time and um and so I
 
05:18:49.430 --> 05:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
was able to see things firsthand and so
 
05:18:50.868 --> 05:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
that's the also the reason why we have
 
05:18:52.708 --> 05:18:52.718 align:start position:0%
so many different co-sponsors on this as
 
05:18:56.270 --> 05:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
well and then what happened um through
 
05:19:00.708 --> 05:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
Jael car and when they first denied the
 
05:19:04.070 --> 05:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
rules and then they realized that or
 
05:19:06.310 --> 05:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
they felt that they realized that it was
 
05:19:07.990 --> 05:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
um that they were making more of a
 
05:19:09.708 --> 05:19:09.718 align:start position:0%
policy decision
 
05:19:11.910 --> 05:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
um and that that's the legislature's
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
role um we decided to put these into
 
05:19:14.878 --> 05:19:16.868 align:start position:0%
role um we decided to put these into
policy

05:19:16.868 --> 05:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
policy
 
05:19:20.670 --> 05:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
so basically right now we have from one
 
05:19:23.230 --> 05:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
criteria alone the weakest rules in the
 
05:19:26.230 --> 05:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
world they're produced under a statute
 
05:19:28.670 --> 05:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
that literally says just go ahead and
 
05:19:33.548 --> 05:19:33.558 align:start position:0%
write the rules this bill exactly um is
 
05:19:36.150 --> 05:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
what we need it's the guard rails really
 
05:19:39.230 --> 05:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
so it improves a set of um improves a
 
05:19:40.270 --> 05:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
set of
 
05:19:43.110 --> 05:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
rules that basically Dees doesn't even
 
05:19:45.708 --> 05:19:45.718 align:start position:0%
have to work on for these little items
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
that I've put in here um because the
 
05:19:49.990 --> 05:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
legislature did all the work um to get
 
05:19:52.830 --> 05:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
to where we are today through hundreds
 
05:19:56.030 --> 05:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
of hours of testimony experts research
 
05:19:59.110 --> 05:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
talking to other states all of that so
 
05:20:02.708 --> 05:20:02.718 align:start position:0%
in the bill at the end of the bill um
 
05:20:04.628 --> 05:20:04.638 align:start position:0%
it's one of the most important parts of
 
05:20:07.430 --> 05:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
the bill it it's from lines on page
 
05:20:11.190 --> 05:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
three from 31 to 36 and it's basically
 
05:20:14.510 --> 05:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
changing an introductory paragraph and
 
05:20:16.590 --> 05:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
it says the commissioner have shall have
 
05:20:18.310 --> 05:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
the responsibility and authority to
 
05:20:21.628 --> 05:20:21.638 align:start position:0%
adopt rules under RSA 541a that are
 
05:20:24.150 --> 05:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect the public health
 
05:20:26.628 --> 05:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
and the environment with an ample margin
 
05:20:31.470 --> 05:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
of safety relative to this chapter so
 
05:20:33.788 --> 05:20:33.798 align:start position:0%
those 10 words basically that
 
05:20:36.548 --> 05:20:36.558 align:start position:0%
modification makes it clear that our
 
05:20:38.788 --> 05:20:38.798 align:start position:0%
their job really is to protect the the
 
05:20:41.110 --> 05:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
environment not to just write the
 
05:20:44.150 --> 05:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
rules so I just want everybody to
 
05:20:46.628 --> 05:20:46.638 align:start position:0%
remember because I wasn't here at that
 
05:20:51.070 --> 05:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
point um in 22 uh 2022 the house and the
 
05:20:54.990 --> 05:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
Senate passed site specific setb rules
 
05:20:57.750 --> 05:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
um it was it was the bill was 1454 I
 
05:21:00.510 --> 05:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
think it was representative um Matt
 
05:21:03.190 --> 05:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
Simon um put it forward but it was
 
05:21:05.830 --> 05:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
vetoed by the governor and then we
 
05:21:07.750 --> 05:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
almost got it overwritten we were able
 
05:21:10.948 --> 05:21:10.958 align:start position:0%
to get it overwritten in one chamber so
 
05:21:13.750 --> 05:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
but Dees already knew in a sense what
 
05:21:17.310 --> 05:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
what the legislator's intent was um and
 
05:21:19.628 --> 05:21:19.638 align:start position:0%
this completely these new rules have
 
05:21:22.430 --> 05:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
completely missed the Mark I would say
 
05:21:25.590 --> 05:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
tenfold um Dees was also told a very
 
05:21:27.510 --> 05:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
long time ago that Solid Waste
 
05:21:30.070 --> 05:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
permitting should be sight specific and
 
05:21:32.350 --> 05:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
moreover it's where the legislative
 
05:21:35.350 --> 05:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
intent is the bills that have been filed
 
05:21:38.030 --> 05:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
over the last five to six years clearly
 
05:21:40.548 --> 05:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
state what the legislature has been
 
05:21:46.070 --> 05:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
trying to do um so the March 2024 Draft
 
05:21:48.350 --> 05:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
rules um they were already the weakest
 
05:21:51.030 --> 05:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
in the world it allowed pollution to
 
05:21:54.350 --> 05:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
move at three feet per day whereas Most
 
05:21:56.990 --> 05:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
states and countries restricted to a
 
05:22:01.350 --> 05:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
couple of feet per year but then long
 
05:22:05.350 --> 05:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
after public comments ended de adds Dees
 
05:22:08.548 --> 05:22:08.558 align:start position:0%
added actually one piece of this um it
 
05:22:10.548 --> 05:22:10.558 align:start position:0%
was a Gravely dangerous sentence to the
 
05:22:13.430 --> 05:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
rules which eliminates even that weakest
 
05:22:16.590 --> 05:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
World weakest in the in the world test
 
05:22:18.350 --> 05:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
and allows a landfill to be built
 
05:22:20.628 --> 05:22:20.638 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the state as long as there's
 
05:22:24.590 --> 05:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
24 in of imported dirt under it that
 
05:22:27.150 --> 05:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
sentence explicitly allows the dirt to
 
05:22:31.230 --> 05:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
transmit pollution at 3 Ines per day
 
05:22:33.350 --> 05:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
which of course is 8 days to go through
 
05:22:35.910 --> 05:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
24 Ines of
 
05:22:38.548 --> 05:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
soil so
 
05:22:40.310 --> 05:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
like I said the bill already has 14
 
05:22:43.030 --> 05:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors seven from each party
 
05:22:44.788 --> 05:22:44.798 align:start position:0%
including three from the
 
05:22:47.788 --> 05:22:47.798 align:start position:0%
Senate we all agree with um we all
 
05:22:49.788 --> 05:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
agreed with jel Carr that the rules are
 
05:22:52.110 --> 05:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
contrary to public interest and contrary
 
05:22:54.868 --> 05:22:54.878 align:start position:0%
to statute so this bill simply picks up
 
05:22:57.230 --> 05:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
the ball and changes the rules and
 
05:22:59.910 --> 05:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
changes the statute but in a small and
 
05:22:59.920 --> 05:23:01.310 align:start position:0%
changes the statute but in a small and
fundamental

05:23:01.310 --> 05:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
fundamental
 
05:23:04.788 --> 05:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
way um I wanted to I know it's been
 
05:23:06.310 --> 05:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
talked about a lot when we talk about
 
05:23:08.750 --> 05:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
solid waste the governor has has
 
05:23:10.830 --> 05:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
strongly signaled her opposition to the
 
05:23:13.590 --> 05:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
Dalton project you know and that
 
05:23:17.350 --> 05:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
situation um is is basically you know
 
05:23:19.628 --> 05:23:19.638 align:start position:0%
more Grim now for that project than it
 
05:23:23.150 --> 05:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
was even a month ago but the rules and
 
05:23:25.270 --> 05:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
this is the most important thing it's
 
05:23:28.110 --> 05:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
not about one project right now the
 
05:23:30.830 --> 05:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
rules will allow a landfill to be put
 
05:23:32.070 --> 05:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
05:23:34.470 --> 05:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere so if the rules are not
 
05:23:37.590 --> 05:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
Rewritten Rewritten some company could
 
05:23:39.910 --> 05:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
come in could come to nashwa could come
 
05:23:41.628 --> 05:23:41.638 align:start position:0%
to Keane
 
05:23:44.510 --> 05:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
conquered wherever and find another
 
05:23:47.350 --> 05:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
terrible track of land and claim that
 
05:23:50.430 --> 05:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
the rules entitled them to build
 
05:23:50.440 --> 05:23:52.750 align:start position:0%
the rules entitled them to build
there

05:23:52.750 --> 05:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:23:56.990 --> 05:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
so basically um the Rewritten rules
 
05:23:59.548 --> 05:23:59.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely do not make it impossible or
 
05:24:02.470 --> 05:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
even hard to site a landfill in a decent
 
05:24:04.830 --> 05:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
location one thing we know for sure is
 
05:24:06.708 --> 05:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
that the current rules are the most
 
05:24:08.670 --> 05:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
permissive in the world and do not
 
05:24:11.350 --> 05:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
exempt virtually any tract it should be
 
05:24:14.670 --> 05:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
hard to cite a landfill and you may hear
 
05:24:17.150 --> 05:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
testimony um later this afternoon from
 
05:24:19.868 --> 05:24:19.878 align:start position:0%
people who want it to be so easy so that
 
05:24:21.910 --> 05:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
no thought needs to be put into the
 
05:24:24.150 --> 05:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
location those people are gambling with
 
05:24:27.830 --> 05:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
every resident in this state and one
 
05:24:29.990 --> 05:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
that wrote opposing testimony that we
 
05:24:32.510 --> 05:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
all received is a paid contractor for
 
05:24:34.510 --> 05:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
the industry that is working on the only
 
05:24:36.430 --> 05:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
permit that is in
 
05:24:40.510 --> 05:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
de's um office at this
 
05:24:43.430 --> 05:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
point I want to um make it clear that
 
05:24:45.948 --> 05:24:45.958 align:start position:0%
I've had some conversations with the
 
05:24:48.910 --> 05:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
industry about my bill and there has to
 
05:24:49.868 --> 05:24:49.878 align:start position:0%
be some
 
05:24:53.070 --> 05:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
changes um there's a couple places in
 
05:24:53.080 --> 05:24:54.750 align:start position:0%
changes um there's a couple places in
here

05:24:54.750 --> 05:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:24:58.788 --> 05:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
where I was I'd say that I got a little
 
05:25:03.190 --> 05:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
aggressive and those are up for some
 
05:25:06.750 --> 05:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
changes um one was a at the 10 mile
 
05:25:11.310 --> 05:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
radius um in here um and another was the
 
05:25:15.470 --> 05:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
Ford Act is already law so um that's not
 
05:25:17.590 --> 05:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
really an issue it doesn't necessarily
 
05:25:19.708 --> 05:25:19.718 align:start position:0%
have to be in the bill but we wanted it
 
05:25:22.110 --> 05:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
in listed in the rules since it's
 
05:25:24.350 --> 05:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
already federal law in regards with
 
05:25:26.830 --> 05:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
permitting around um of course airports
 
05:25:31.350 --> 05:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
and such um and then of course um with
 
05:25:34.430 --> 05:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
violations that can be changed as well
 
05:25:37.430 --> 05:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
um to maybe say repeated violations you
 
05:25:40.190 --> 05:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
know Bad actors repeat offenders um but
 
05:25:44.590 --> 05:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
I also do want to say that already um an
 
05:25:48.510 --> 05:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
automatic deny of a landfill that is um
 
05:25:52.868 --> 05:25:52.878 align:start position:0%
of a permit application is if the um if
 
05:25:55.070 --> 05:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
the person putting the permit the
 
05:25:59.230 --> 05:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
company um has broken the law in the
 
05:26:01.070 --> 05:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
sense of where they're being sued
 
05:26:02.948 --> 05:26:02.958 align:start position:0%
currently so if there's an active
 
05:26:05.510 --> 05:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuit you're not allowed to put it a
 
05:26:07.548 --> 05:26:07.558 align:start position:0%
permit so we're already protected by
 
05:26:10.670 --> 05:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
that so because of that reason it makes
 
05:26:12.270 --> 05:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
me feel better in regards with the
 
05:26:14.230 --> 05:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
violation pieces that I have here in
 
05:26:18.948 --> 05:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
this bill and on that note I think I've
 
05:26:18.958 --> 05:26:20.910 align:start position:0%
this bill and on that note I think I've
covered

05:26:20.910 --> 05:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
covered
 
05:26:20.920 --> 05:26:22.910 align:start position:0%
covered
everything

05:26:22.910 --> 05:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
everything
 
05:26:25.230 --> 05:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
okay um you have a pink slip that you
 
05:26:27.628 --> 05:26:27.638 align:start position:0%
filled out for your testimony no but
 
05:26:30.030 --> 05:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll do and I want to thank you for
 
05:26:32.948 --> 05:26:32.958 align:start position:0%
your work on this very important Bill
 
05:26:36.150 --> 05:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um I don't know any other
 
05:26:39.390 --> 05:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bixby yeah I uh
 
05:26:41.788 --> 05:26:41.798 align:start position:0%
I think this might be covered under what
 
05:26:43.510 --> 05:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
you you one of the things you mentioned
 
05:26:47.270 --> 05:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be um reworked a little bit but
 
05:26:49.670 --> 05:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
um on page
 
05:26:52.030 --> 05:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
three uh line
 
05:26:54.510 --> 05:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
18 uh no permit for the operation of
 
05:26:56.628 --> 05:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
solid Wasteland fill shall be issued in
 
05:26:58.670 --> 05:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for any applicant who has
 
05:27:00.590 --> 05:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
been found in violation of any federal
 
05:27:03.110 --> 05:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
state or local environmental laws
 
05:27:05.270 --> 05:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
regulations or permit conditions
 
05:27:09.270 --> 05:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the United States uh and
 
05:27:12.230 --> 05:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh so that is all going to be reworked
 
05:27:14.628 --> 05:27:14.638 align:start position:0%
that's that so so you're going to rework
 
05:27:17.270 --> 05:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
that so that if it's a permit if it's if
 
05:27:19.070 --> 05:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
if it's a violation that has been
 
05:27:21.948 --> 05:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
brought to the attention of the landfill
 
05:27:23.510 --> 05:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
operator and they are working on
 
05:27:25.990 --> 05:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
remediating it that that is not a
 
05:27:28.948 --> 05:27:28.958 align:start position:0%
correct problem exactly okay thank
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
you questions representative rer whoops
 
05:27:34.190 --> 05:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for what it seems like a very
 
05:27:38.590 --> 05:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
important uh bill um there's a I think
 
05:27:41.070 --> 05:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
this might just been an oversight but in
 
05:27:43.510 --> 05:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
um the distance for the setback
 
05:27:45.390 --> 05:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
initially you referred to portable water
 
05:27:48.910 --> 05:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
supply PR Rivers lake or Coastal water
 
05:27:52.868 --> 05:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
but later I guess that's on um line 24
 
05:27:56.070 --> 05:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
page 1 we don't have portable water qual
 
05:27:59.070 --> 05:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
Aqua for there so you may want to uh
 
05:28:00.670 --> 05:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
check make sure we're consistent with
 
05:28:03.708 --> 05:28:03.718 align:start position:0%
where you're measuring from so on on
 
05:28:08.150 --> 05:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
line 24 page one a poble water aquafer
 
05:28:09.910 --> 05:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
is not listed what what page is that
 
05:28:13.788 --> 05:28:13.798 align:start position:0%
page page one line 24 page one line
 
05:28:16.110 --> 05:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
24 okay yeah so just make certain that
 
05:28:18.030 --> 05:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
we know we're measuring from the same
 
05:28:20.708 --> 05:28:20.718 align:start position:0%
points on all Y and that's that also you
 
05:28:25.230 --> 05:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
have that on page uh page two uh
 
05:28:28.750 --> 05:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
line8 same thing we insert the uh
 
05:28:30.910 --> 05:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
potable water aquifer if that's
 
05:28:33.708 --> 05:28:33.718 align:start position:0%
intentional location perfect thank you
 
05:28:34.788 --> 05:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
otherwise thank you very much I
 
05:28:37.430 --> 05:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate it oh I'd also like to bring
 
05:28:42.910 --> 05:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
up um it was an oversight by um OS and
 
05:28:46.548 --> 05:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:49.708 --> 05:28:49.718 align:start position:0%
mistake so I've already put in an an
 
05:28:52.230 --> 05:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
amendment to it's literally one word so
 
05:28:55.310 --> 05:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
on page three
 
05:28:59.310 --> 05:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
line8 and this is this basically this um
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
hydraulic conductivity this is the this
 
05:29:03.548 --> 05:29:03.558 align:start position:0%
is the meat of this bill this is one of
 
05:29:05.628 --> 05:29:05.638 align:start position:0%
this is the most important thing what I
 
05:29:07.470 --> 05:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
was talking about which makes us the
 
05:29:10.230 --> 05:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
weakest in the world um it's supposed to
 
05:29:13.990 --> 05:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
say no amount of imported soil can
 
05:29:18.030 --> 05:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
overcome not come so there was a can
 
05:29:22.070 --> 05:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
come such deficiency so um I didn't send
 
05:29:24.110 --> 05:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
it to her wrong so it was it wasn't mine
 
05:29:26.470 --> 05:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
so um OS doesn't usually do copy and
 
05:29:28.230 --> 05:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
paste they they're very good about
 
05:29:30.430 --> 05:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
retyping so that's where but that's
 
05:29:32.470 --> 05:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
already been fixed not including the
 
05:29:35.788 --> 05:29:35.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:39.990 --> 05:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
on okay um any other questions from the
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
committee I oh uh represent wheeler
 
05:29:44.990 --> 05:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm in The
 
05:29:46.750 --> 05:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
Boondock so we all try
 
05:29:49.310 --> 05:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
to my
 
05:29:52.788 --> 05:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
hand yes exactly a Wheeler
 
05:29:55.150 --> 05:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
flat thank you madam
 
05:29:57.470 --> 05:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
chair representative Potenza would you
 
05:29:59.390 --> 05:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
believe and I know that you brought this
 
05:30:02.190 --> 05:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
up in your testimony a little bit but uh
 
05:30:04.948 --> 05:30:04.958 align:start position:0%
I had spoken to somebody who was on Jael
 
05:30:07.270 --> 05:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
car who voted against those rules
 
05:30:08.510 --> 05:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
because they
 
05:30:09.948 --> 05:30:09.958 align:start position:0%
had spoken to somebody from the
 
05:30:12.470 --> 05:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Agency who told
 
05:30:15.310 --> 05:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
them that these rules were essentially a
 
05:30:17.868 --> 05:30:17.878 align:start position:0%
joke would you believe that that the EPA
 
05:30:20.868 --> 05:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
views our environmental rules as a
 
05:30:24.430 --> 05:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
joke I would believe that um that is why
 
05:30:28.110 --> 05:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
we are that's why we have other states
 
05:30:31.270 --> 05:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
that are basically Banning landfills
 
05:30:33.830 --> 05:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
because they're bringing in you know 50%
 
05:30:36.948 --> 05:30:36.958 align:start position:0%
of their waste into New Hampshire so
 
05:30:38.430 --> 05:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of stuff that we have
 
05:30:42.990 --> 05:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
to look at um landfills are they're a
 
05:30:45.510 --> 05:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
necessity I get it but they should be
 
05:30:47.948 --> 05:30:47.958 align:start position:0%
the last thing that were looked at um
 
05:30:49.750 --> 05:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
and we're not looking at any other
 
05:30:52.070 --> 05:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
things I I forget when I first started
 
05:30:54.390 --> 05:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
with the committee there was a wonderful
 
05:30:57.350 --> 05:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
recycling presentation and I think New
 
05:31:00.590 --> 05:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was like in the bottom barrel
 
05:31:03.390 --> 05:31:03.400 align:start position:0%
of that like we're like the worst in the
 
05:31:07.150 --> 05:31:07.160 align:start position:0%
49th ranking of um in regards with
 
05:31:09.670 --> 05:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
recycling in in doing all of that it's
 
05:31:12.948 --> 05:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
taken us a long time to get where we are
 
05:31:16.110 --> 05:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
right now but a lot of people are awake
 
05:31:16.120 --> 05:31:17.830 align:start position:0%
right now but a lot of people are awake
they're

05:31:17.830 --> 05:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:31:21.270 --> 05:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
um they're really looking at this the
 
05:31:24.150 --> 05:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
real New Hampshire Advantage is to have
 
05:31:26.750 --> 05:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
clean drinking water and wonderful clean
 
05:31:31.070 --> 05:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
spaces we have nothing if we don't have
 
05:31:34.430 --> 05:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
that representative ger thank you madam
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative so could
 
05:31:39.230 --> 05:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
you explain a little bit
 
05:31:42.230 --> 05:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
more what you mean when you refer to a
 
05:31:42.240 --> 05:31:43.430 align:start position:0%
more what you mean when you refer to a
site

05:31:43.430 --> 05:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
site
 
05:31:46.030 --> 05:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
specific criteria that obviously has
 
05:31:48.230 --> 05:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
been a phrase we use a lot it's kind of
 
05:31:49.590 --> 05:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
a bone of contention but if you could
 
05:31:52.070 --> 05:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
speak to how this bill is intended to
 
05:31:56.070 --> 05:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
Pro provide site specific
 
05:32:02.350 --> 05:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
criteria um I turned off my mic yes
 
05:32:05.270 --> 05:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
so one specifically if you're talking
 
05:32:09.910 --> 05:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
about um you know on page three lines 4
 
05:32:13.230 --> 05:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
through n that right there is very sight
 
05:32:14.990 --> 05:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
specific there's a lot of other things
 
05:32:18.150 --> 05:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
in here that talk about um you know
 
05:32:20.910 --> 05:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
certain setbacks and and stuff like that
 
05:32:23.628 --> 05:32:23.638 align:start position:0%
but um you know the setback from any
 
05:32:26.750 --> 05:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
paral River Lake water shell M it's all
 
05:32:29.670 --> 05:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
about distance of travel so it's not
 
05:32:32.948 --> 05:32:32.958 align:start position:0%
giving a number so representative Simon
 
05:32:34.510 --> 05:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
and I used to talk about this all the
 
05:32:36.788 --> 05:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
time you know we can't just pick some
 
05:32:40.030 --> 05:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number because of course soil
 
05:32:43.470 --> 05:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
and and and um and basically you know if
 
05:32:45.270 --> 05:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
we're not digging down with the Bedrock
 
05:32:46.310 --> 05:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
and all of that kind of stuff is
 
05:32:47.868 --> 05:32:47.878 align:start position:0%
different wherever you go I'll never
 
05:32:51.350 --> 05:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
forget in in when they dug the well
 
05:32:53.830 --> 05:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
where in our first house um in New
 
05:32:56.230 --> 05:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that I owned and
 
05:32:58.590 --> 05:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
conquered you know the neighbor didn't
 
05:33:01.270 --> 05:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
have a good water flow but we did and we
 
05:33:02.910 --> 05:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
were literally like right next to each
 
05:33:06.310 --> 05:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
other so all of the stuff in here is all
 
05:33:09.270 --> 05:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
based upon time of travel in basically
 
05:33:12.270 --> 05:33:12.280 align:start position:0%
looking at what that site is you know
 
05:33:13.788 --> 05:33:13.798 align:start position:0%
what kind of soil it is is it in a
 
05:33:15.390 --> 05:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
gravel pit is it in a sand pit does it
 
05:33:17.670 --> 05:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
have Clay all of that kind of stuff is
 
05:33:20.070 --> 05:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
taken into all of these different
 
05:33:21.830 --> 05:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
criteria that are put in here so
 
05:33:23.548 --> 05:33:23.558 align:start position:0%
everything's looked at individually we
 
05:33:25.830 --> 05:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
don't just say oh 500 set 500 foot
 
05:33:28.110 --> 05:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
setback that's it that's good enough no
 
05:33:30.948 --> 05:33:30.958 align:start position:0%
you got to look at everything around it
 
05:33:34.628 --> 05:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
so follow up thank you and also as I
 
05:33:38.030 --> 05:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
look at it page one uh line 29 starting
 
05:33:41.948 --> 05:33:41.958 align:start position:0%
there that's s 17 section one and isn't
 
05:33:43.510 --> 05:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
this also where the the work of the
 
05:33:46.548 --> 05:33:46.558 align:start position:0%
hydrologist comes in to perform a
 
05:33:49.110 --> 05:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive evaluation of the specific
 
05:33:51.948 --> 05:33:51.958 align:start position:0%
site to decide what that fiveyear
 
05:33:55.190 --> 05:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
setback distance means in terms of space
 
05:33:59.110 --> 05:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
yes very important 16 through 22 yes
 
05:34:00.190 --> 05:34:00.200 align:start position:0%
very very
 
05:34:02.788 --> 05:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
important thank
 
05:34:06.070 --> 05:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Howard thank you
 
05:34:08.910 --> 05:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I I remember in last
 
05:34:10.990 --> 05:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
session I guess my question is is this
 
05:34:12.910 --> 05:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
meant to displace the rules that that
 
05:34:14.750 --> 05:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
were put in place in between the time in
 
05:34:17.628 --> 05:34:17.638 align:start position:0%
the last session when we tried to be um
 
05:34:19.910 --> 05:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
almost as you know as prescriptive as
 
05:34:22.390 --> 05:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
rules would be and they there was sort
 
05:34:24.788 --> 05:34:24.798 align:start position:0%
of a promise made to us that um we
 
05:34:26.868 --> 05:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
didn't need to legislate it because the
 
05:34:29.708 --> 05:34:29.718 align:start position:0%
rules were going to be comprehensive and
 
05:34:32.510 --> 05:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
and updated and all of that and and this
 
05:34:36.628 --> 05:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
seems like another attempt to help them
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:34:41.910 --> 05:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh make law make rules that are that are
 
05:34:44.590 --> 05:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
that are sight specific and and advanced
 
05:34:47.350 --> 05:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
into the science of today rather than um
 
05:34:49.350 --> 05:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
what we what we found in the old rules
 
05:34:51.590 --> 05:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
before we did it in last session and I'm
 
05:34:52.868 --> 05:34:52.878 align:start position:0%
just wondering are we going to get the
 
05:34:56.190 --> 05:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
same push back about rules versus
 
05:34:59.910 --> 05:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:04.350 --> 05:35:04.360 align:start position:0%
time well I'm hoping not because
 
05:35:08.830 --> 05:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
um I think as we learn from from Jael
 
05:35:12.070 --> 05:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
car that we're supposed to be the policy
 
05:35:14.670 --> 05:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
drivers and this is really driving that
 
05:35:16.590 --> 05:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
there's gaps there's a lot of great
 
05:35:19.510 --> 05:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
things in the new rules but the most
 
05:35:23.310 --> 05:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
critical things are are missing and and
 
05:35:26.990 --> 05:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
missing by a mile and this puts them in
 
05:35:28.670 --> 05:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
and I mean the rules are there're you
 
05:35:31.788 --> 05:35:31.798 align:start position:0%
know it's a very very long document so
 
05:35:34.470 --> 05:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's really an 800 rule but there's
 
05:35:36.708 --> 05:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
multiple things that you know it's they
 
05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
call it one rule but all these different
 
05:35:40.390 --> 05:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
things that are in it so this changes
 
05:35:42.868 --> 05:35:42.878 align:start position:0%
those things which is really important
 
05:35:45.110 --> 05:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
but the during the whole process the
 
05:35:49.310 --> 05:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
process was completely broken and um
 
05:35:52.430 --> 05:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
from the beginning the waste management
 
05:35:55.708 --> 05:35:55.718 align:start position:0%
Council had no representation of from
 
05:35:58.750 --> 05:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
for the public or public health there's
 
05:36:00.868 --> 05:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
you know and basically you had a one
 
05:36:03.190 --> 05:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
person on there that was helping write
 
05:36:06.470 --> 05:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
the permit for the only permit that Dees
 
05:36:09.590 --> 05:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
has that was you know in that room and
 
05:36:11.390 --> 05:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
saying oh that they're not weak enough
 
05:36:14.670 --> 05:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
four times the rules changed four times
 
05:36:17.788 --> 05:36:17.798 align:start position:0%
they were weakened that's a ton and that
 
05:36:19.868 --> 05:36:19.878 align:start position:0%
wasn't from the public testimony that
 
05:36:21.590 --> 05:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
was going on there were a lot of private
 
05:36:23.350 --> 05:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
meetings that were happening that were
 
05:36:25.750 --> 05:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
that industry is pushing back on Dees to
 
05:36:27.788 --> 05:36:27.798 align:start position:0%
make them weaker we know that for fact
 
05:36:31.670 --> 05:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
we have the 91a documents so we just we
 
05:36:33.430 --> 05:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
got to be the legislature needs to be in
 
05:36:36.670 --> 05:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
the driver's seat on this there's been
 
05:36:39.070 --> 05:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
boatloads of expert testimony I I've
 
05:36:40.750 --> 05:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
been I mean from talking to people in
 
05:36:43.670 --> 05:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
Maine in Pennsylvania and then we have
 
05:36:45.830 --> 05:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
wonderful people here that have lived
 
05:36:48.150 --> 05:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
and breed this that I can't even imagine
 
05:36:49.948 --> 05:36:49.958 align:start position:0%
the amount of time that they spent on
 
05:36:53.708 --> 05:36:53.718 align:start position:0%
all of these things unpaid and and
 
05:36:56.590 --> 05:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
public testimony every bit of the public
 
05:36:59.788 --> 05:36:59.798 align:start position:0%
testimony that has ever come in through
 
05:37:03.670 --> 05:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
um Dees was all against it every single
 
05:37:06.430 --> 05:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
thing the documents that we put together
 
05:37:08.470 --> 05:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative of gerana could speak to
 
05:37:11.868 --> 05:37:11.878 align:start position:0%
this as well pose me a question um we we
 
05:37:14.390 --> 05:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
gave this whole long document and said
 
05:37:16.270 --> 05:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
why why why why can't you do this this
 
05:37:18.510 --> 05:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
and this and not one of those things
 
05:37:21.868 --> 05:37:21.878 align:start position:0%
ever got put into the rules so uh we had
 
05:37:24.990 --> 05:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
a a wonderful hydrogeologist that came
 
05:37:27.230 --> 05:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
and presented it to us and gave us this
 
05:37:29.948 --> 05:37:29.958 align:start position:0%
chart if this committee wants all of the
 
05:37:33.310 --> 05:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
data I mean I'm gonna I'm gonna bury you
 
05:37:36.990 --> 05:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
with the book of it I will I mean it's
 
05:37:39.430 --> 05:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
hard you don't know what you don't know
 
05:37:42.070 --> 05:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
but when you live and breathe this oh my
 
05:37:45.070 --> 05:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
gosh it's glaring and we've got to make
 
05:37:48.910 --> 05:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
the changes and the time is
 
05:37:51.990 --> 05:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
now okay any other
 
05:37:54.830 --> 05:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
questions I only have one question in so
 
05:37:58.510 --> 05:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
far as um you know i' I've heard talk
 
05:38:04.030 --> 05:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
about the one by 10 to the minus5 cm per
 
05:38:09.628 --> 05:38:09.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:12.150 --> 05:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:38:16.670 --> 05:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
threshold that stringent threshold
 
05:38:19.548 --> 05:38:19.558 align:start position:0%
necessary based on the fact that we
 
05:38:23.548 --> 05:38:23.558 align:start position:0%
require in New Hampshire two liners for
 
05:38:25.990 --> 05:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
a landfill where other states do not
 
05:38:27.910 --> 05:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
require two
 
05:38:32.190 --> 05:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
liners good question um I'm not familiar
 
05:38:36.990 --> 05:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
with um liner requirements around other
 
05:38:38.670 --> 05:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
other stat stes I do believe that that
 
05:38:41.830 --> 05:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
has someone has gone and looked at that
 
05:38:44.030 --> 05:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I know that the main landfill I
 
05:38:46.270 --> 05:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
believe that they require two liners we
 
05:38:47.948 --> 05:38:47.958 align:start position:0%
just looked into that one they're a
 
05:38:51.708 --> 05:38:51.718 align:start position:0%
public private landfill um
 
05:38:54.670 --> 05:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
05:38:58.110 --> 05:38:58.120 align:start position:0%
still liners fail there's nothing that
 
05:39:00.430 --> 05:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
can stop it they're going to leak
 
05:39:03.270 --> 05:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
eventually and if there's two great it
 
05:39:06.390 --> 05:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
won't leak as soon as we know from
 
05:39:08.230 --> 05:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
documents that we have
 
05:39:11.430 --> 05:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
um from supplied by Dees there was a
 
05:39:15.230 --> 05:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
puncture in the NCS ncees landfill in
 
05:39:18.110 --> 05:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem uh I think about 10 years ago
 
05:39:19.468 --> 05:39:19.478 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why probably why
 
05:39:22.990 --> 05:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
that's leaking and you know there's
 
05:39:26.390 --> 05:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
really not been a lot of anything done
 
05:39:29.430 --> 05:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
about that so we've got issues here
 
05:39:31.350 --> 05:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
people make mistakes it's it's going to
 
05:39:33.110 --> 05:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
happen so you have to make sure that
 
05:39:35.110 --> 05:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
wherever you're putting it and it's not
 
05:39:37.590 --> 05:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
stringent I will give you if you don't
 
05:39:39.270 --> 05:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
have that document it was a document
 
05:39:41.830 --> 05:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
that we received um on the rule
 
05:39:44.110 --> 05:39:44.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative ger remember
 
05:39:46.628 --> 05:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
all the other states in their numbers we
 
05:39:50.310 --> 05:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
are still if we're at 10 to
 
05:39:53.548 --> 05:39:53.558 align:start position:0%
the5 um we are
 
05:39:57.868 --> 05:39:57.878 align:start position:0%
still fairly weaker than I don't know I
 
05:40:01.190 --> 05:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
would say about 90% of the other states
 
05:40:02.750 --> 05:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
like you've got South Carolina and
 
05:40:07.830 --> 05:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
others they're 10 to the7 10 to the6 so
 
05:40:11.750 --> 05:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
um if there was wiggle room in there um
 
05:40:14.948 --> 05:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
especially since I've talked with um
 
05:40:18.350 --> 05:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
another landfill operator that is you
 
05:40:20.868 --> 05:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
know possibly looking to expand if that
 
05:40:23.750 --> 05:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
number that 10 to theg5 was going to
 
05:40:25.190 --> 05:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
hurt them for their
 
05:40:28.270 --> 05:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
expansion um there's there's room to to
 
05:40:29.750 --> 05:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
talk about that and bringing it down to
 
05:40:32.750 --> 05:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
the neg four but to the neg -3 and then
 
05:40:36.070 --> 05:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
basically round it up is is
 
05:40:39.548 --> 05:40:39.558 align:start position:0%
insanity and and and my other question
 
05:40:39.558 --> 05:40:43.190 align:start position:0%
insanity and and and my other question
is

05:40:43.190 --> 05:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:46.468 --> 05:40:46.478 align:start position:0%
um with regard
 
05:40:46.478 --> 05:40:47.990 align:start position:0%
um with regard
to

05:40:47.990 --> 05:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:40:52.468 --> 05:40:52.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:56.590 --> 05:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
time or this you know to the neg
 
05:40:56.600 --> 05:41:00.070 align:start position:0%
time or this you know to the neg
five

05:41:00.070 --> 05:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:03.670 --> 05:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
how what percentage of land within the
 
05:41:07.590 --> 05:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire would be
 
05:41:07.600 --> 05:41:08.868 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire would be
um

05:41:08.868 --> 05:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:11.948 --> 05:41:11.958 align:start position:0%
either o an okay place to put a landfill
 
05:41:14.788 --> 05:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
versus not an okay place to put in a
 
05:41:17.270 --> 05:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
landfill do do you have any kind of
 
05:41:19.868 --> 05:41:19.878 align:start position:0%
percentage of you know would we be able
 
05:41:21.708 --> 05:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
to build a landfill based on these
 
05:41:24.230 --> 05:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
numbers we would and I don't have that
 
05:41:27.070 --> 05:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
at the top of my um fingertips right now
 
05:41:29.788 --> 05:41:29.798 align:start position:0%
but there was testimony that we got in
 
05:41:31.868 --> 05:41:31.878 align:start position:0%
that showed I don't know if you remember
 
05:41:33.990 --> 05:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
this that showed there was a map and
 
05:41:36.990 --> 05:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
that showed other areas where um you
 
05:41:39.708 --> 05:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
could side a landfill in the state so
 
05:41:41.628 --> 05:41:41.638 align:start position:0%
and we would only want like I said
 
05:41:44.830 --> 05:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
before in testimony on multiple bills
 
05:41:46.830 --> 05:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
you know we could maybe only have to
 
05:41:49.350 --> 05:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
have one more one more landfill in the
 
05:41:51.990 --> 05:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
next 100 years and that's a good thing
 
05:41:54.390 --> 05:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
so there is there is
 
05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
space all right uh representative Bixby
 
05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then ger would you believe that the
 
05:42:02.708 --> 05:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
approximate indication of that map of of
 
05:42:04.708 --> 05:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
soils that are appropriate for landfill
 
05:42:06.910 --> 05:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
was about 83% of the land area of the
 
05:42:06.920 --> 05:42:08.788 align:start position:0%
was about 83% of the land area of the
state

05:42:08.788 --> 05:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:42:10.708 --> 05:42:10.718 align:start position:0%
no I didn't know that but thank you I
 
05:42:12.190 --> 05:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to it's been a couple
 
05:42:14.910 --> 05:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
years so if if that's not absolutely the
 
05:42:18.430 --> 05:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
right number I I won't uh you
 
05:42:20.628 --> 05:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
know I'm not going to guarantee that
 
05:42:22.070 --> 05:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
exact number but that that was
 
05:42:23.708 --> 05:42:23.718 align:start position:0%
approximately what I remember from a
 
05:42:27.230 --> 05:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
couple years ago representative ger
 
05:42:30.788 --> 05:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair pardon me
 
05:42:32.868 --> 05:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
um try to figure out how to phrase the
 
05:42:36.670 --> 05:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
question pardon me with the some of the
 
05:42:39.030 --> 05:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
opponents of of this particular number
 
05:42:40.468 --> 05:42:40.478 align:start position:0%
which has been around for a while right
 
05:42:42.030 --> 05:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
have have made the argument that there
 
05:42:44.468 --> 05:42:44.478 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be enough land available in the
 
05:42:47.590 --> 05:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
state when they have been asked have
 
05:42:49.830 --> 05:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
representatives of Industry ever
 
05:42:52.270 --> 05:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
provided any statistical evidence to
 
05:42:54.670 --> 05:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
support the claim that they would not be
 
05:42:56.230 --> 05:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
able to site a landfill in this state
 
05:43:00.070 --> 05:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
with the requirements no thank you
 
05:43:02.868 --> 05:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
representative Howard and then did you
 
05:43:05.150 --> 05:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
um when you talk about this 10 to the
 
05:43:08.910 --> 05:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
neg5 requirement um if you if you put
 
05:43:11.910 --> 05:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
that same equation next to a body of
 
05:43:14.350 --> 05:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
water is that is that you know used to
 
05:43:16.270 --> 05:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
be 200 feet maybe now it's 500 feet or
 
05:43:19.070 --> 05:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
something um would you would you still
 
05:43:20.670 --> 05:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
would would the would you would that
 
05:43:23.468 --> 05:43:23.478 align:start position:0%
override the the math or the or what
 
05:43:24.830 --> 05:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
would be more important the water or
 
05:43:27.190 --> 05:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
would it make it to the water yeah
 
05:43:29.868 --> 05:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
there's it it all kind of works out so
 
05:43:32.070 --> 05:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
if you and on page two it discuss it
 
05:43:34.548 --> 05:43:34.558 align:start position:0%
discusses distance of travel estimate so
 
05:43:37.150 --> 05:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
would they would all kind of match up so
 
05:43:39.590 --> 05:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:43:42.110 --> 05:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
basically there there is I mean there is
 
05:43:44.150 --> 05:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
a certain amount that you'd have to be
 
05:43:47.750 --> 05:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
further away than that and because um it
 
05:43:49.548 --> 05:43:49.558 align:start position:0%
depends I mean it really depends on what
 
05:43:51.150 --> 05:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
you're talking about here so if it's
 
05:43:52.948 --> 05:43:52.958 align:start position:0%
like in a wonderful location with clay
 
05:43:55.628 --> 05:43:55.638 align:start position:0%
and all that and then it still meets up
 
05:43:57.990 --> 05:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
with the fiveyear distance time of
 
05:44:01.150 --> 05:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
travel that it's it's it's basically
 
05:44:03.110 --> 05:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
they both are complimenting each other
 
05:44:04.868 --> 05:44:04.878 align:start position:0%
they would be both be the same because
 
05:44:07.270 --> 05:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
the time of travel from the site with 10
 
05:44:10.468 --> 05:44:10.478 align:start position:0%
to theg5 is the same as like the 5year
 
05:44:13.948 --> 05:44:13.958 align:start position:0%
distance so they're both kind of um like
 
05:44:16.390 --> 05:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
parallel to each other or or
 
05:44:18.590 --> 05:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
complimentary it's better
 
05:44:21.628 --> 05:44:21.638 align:start position:0%
word okay any other questions represent
 
05:44:24.150 --> 05:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:44:25.788 --> 05:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
representative for being here and
 
05:44:28.310 --> 05:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
presenting this um just a quick question
 
05:44:29.990 --> 05:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
for you because you've been talking
 
05:44:32.750 --> 05:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
about other states and everything would
 
05:44:35.310 --> 05:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
you say New Hampshire's geography is
 
05:44:39.788 --> 05:44:39.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:41.510 --> 05:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
actually we had someone that testified
 
05:44:43.590 --> 05:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
on that the hydrogeologist testified on
 
05:44:45.468 --> 05:44:45.478 align:start position:0%
that she can speak to that better than I
 
05:44:48.750 --> 05:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
can we are not um there has been the
 
05:44:50.270 --> 05:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
arguments that were made that oh New
 
05:44:52.070 --> 05:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not like any other state
 
05:44:53.910 --> 05:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
and that's actually not true and she
 
05:44:55.708 --> 05:44:55.718 align:start position:0%
spoke to that and I can give you her
 
05:44:58.190 --> 05:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
testimony better um everybody's
 
05:45:00.990 --> 05:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
different there are differences but you
 
05:45:03.510 --> 05:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
know our GE our hydrogeology is very
 
05:45:06.030 --> 05:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
similar to it's got similar to Maine it
 
05:45:09.070 --> 05:45:09.080 align:start position:0%
has similar to Vermont so um and there's
 
05:45:10.510 --> 05:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
some pieces of it that are similar to
 
05:45:13.070 --> 05:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Massachusetts has has such
 
05:45:16.708 --> 05:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
vast amount more um property than we do
 
05:45:17.750 --> 05:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
and it would be great if they didn't
 
05:45:19.590 --> 05:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
have a ban in place because they could
 
05:45:21.788 --> 05:45:21.798 align:start position:0%
do a public private landfill and take
 
05:45:24.830 --> 05:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
care of their own trash and it'd be
 
05:45:26.990 --> 05:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful any other
 
05:45:29.548 --> 05:45:29.558 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Penza
 
05:45:32.990 --> 05:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate you introducing this
 
05:45:37.230 --> 05:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
bill I am calling John Swan from safe
 
05:45:39.390 --> 05:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake up in
 
05:45:44.948 --> 05:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:51.310 --> 05:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:56.788 --> 05:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
sorry I was reminded after our last um
 
05:45:59.910 --> 05:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh hearing similar hearing that placards
 
05:46:01.230 --> 05:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
like that were not allowed in the
 
05:46:03.788 --> 05:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
committee room so well apologize
 
05:46:06.628 --> 05:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
apologies if I broke any rules no no
 
05:46:09.510 --> 05:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
rules rules I wasn't aware of so good
 
05:46:11.750 --> 05:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon Madam chairman CH and members
 
05:46:14.670 --> 05:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh my name is John Swan
 
05:46:16.270 --> 05:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
I live in Dalton New Hampshire I'm the
 
05:46:20.150 --> 05:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
founder of save Forest Lake and um uh
 
05:46:21.310 --> 05:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me the
 
05:46:22.910 --> 05:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide my import and
 
05:46:26.708 --> 05:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 707 requiring the
 
05:46:29.270 --> 05:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services to
 
05:46:31.628 --> 05:46:31.638 align:start position:0%
establish a site specific setback
 
05:46:34.190 --> 05:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
distance for proposed new
 
05:46:37.190 --> 05:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
landfills um as a prec precursor to my
 
05:46:39.590 --> 05:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
testimony and in order to not get sued a
 
05:46:42.150 --> 05:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
third time by cassella Waste Systems I
 
05:46:43.628 --> 05:46:43.638 align:start position:0%
need you to understand that all this is
 
05:46:46.830 --> 05:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
my opinion based on my research and
 
05:46:50.310 --> 05:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
experience um I would urge the committee
 
05:46:52.430 --> 05:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
to support House Bill 7
 
05:46:56.310 --> 05:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
707 and I'm here to uh part of my
 
05:46:59.670 --> 05:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
testimony was my uh my placard uh
 
05:47:03.788 --> 05:47:03.798 align:start position:0%
detailing a real world example for the
 
05:47:07.110 --> 05:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
committee of what a poorly cited
 
05:47:09.910 --> 05:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
landfill looks like that has gone bad
 
05:47:12.868 --> 05:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
and that would be the NCS landfill in
 
05:47:18.548 --> 05:47:18.558 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem um it was it was a in 19 I
 
05:47:21.150 --> 05:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
have the in the documentation I provided
 
05:47:24.110 --> 05:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
to the committee I did send via email on
 
05:47:27.150 --> 05:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
page on page three of my testimony there
 
05:47:30.750 --> 05:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
is a uh a a hydro report from
 
05:47:34.030 --> 05:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
1984 I believe regarding the sanco
 
05:47:36.590 --> 05:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
landfill where the NCS landfill is now
 
05:47:39.150 --> 05:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
signed Ed um and that site it says in
 
05:47:42.548 --> 05:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph um Harold Brown um
 
05:47:45.590 --> 05:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
was the former owner in 1976 the site
 
05:47:49.910 --> 05:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
was formerly a borrow pit so there's
 
05:47:53.830 --> 05:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
that and then also um uh there's another
 
05:47:56.230 --> 05:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
um on page the next page there's a uh
 
05:47:57.628 --> 05:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
report from
 
05:48:01.670 --> 05:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
GZA um and second paragraph the site
 
05:48:04.948 --> 05:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
lies within a portion of a Northerly
 
05:48:08.750 --> 05:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
draining 350 acre Watershed which is
 
05:48:11.548 --> 05:48:11.558 align:start position:0%
part of the larger amusic River
 
05:48:14.310 --> 05:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
Watershed so and then it goes down to
 
05:48:16.230 --> 05:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
say that the site is located
 
05:48:18.750 --> 05:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
approximately 400 feet Northeast of the
 
05:48:22.190 --> 05:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
northeast corner of the site um so
 
05:48:25.150 --> 05:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
basically that's an example of of why we
 
05:48:28.788 --> 05:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
need this this bill to pass because we
 
05:48:30.510 --> 05:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
we could we have an opportunity to pres
 
05:48:34.788 --> 05:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
prevent the mistakes of the past and um
 
05:48:37.830 --> 05:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
most of the documentation I did send the
 
05:48:43.230 --> 05:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
committee um details the ongoing and
 
05:48:46.868 --> 05:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
widespread um site contamination at the
 
05:48:51.190 --> 05:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
NCS facility uh in Bethlehem um and I
 
05:48:53.190 --> 05:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
did this is kind of I'm going a little
 
05:48:55.030 --> 05:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
off topic here off track but
 
05:48:58.030 --> 05:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
representative Howard asked the question
 
05:48:58.040 --> 05:48:59.430 align:start position:0%
representative Howard asked the question
um

05:48:59.430 --> 05:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:01.948 --> 05:49:01.958 align:start position:0%
previously would would it make it the
 
05:49:04.628 --> 05:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
water and what I've provided to you and
 
05:49:08.030 --> 05:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
what my my map showed uh site map which
 
05:49:12.548 --> 05:49:12.558 align:start position:0%
is from uh the July 2024 uh groundwater
 
05:49:17.310 --> 05:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
um monitoring report provided to Dees um
 
05:49:19.910 --> 05:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
it already is in Bethlehem reaching the
 
05:49:24.150 --> 05:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
water I've provided test results my own
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
testing um from October 20th
 
05:49:30.190 --> 05:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
2023 June 13
 
05:49:32.788 --> 05:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
2024 uh subsequent testing two weeks
 
05:49:35.708 --> 05:49:35.718 align:start position:0%
later of the second seep further down uh
 
05:49:39.310 --> 05:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
Downstream of the uh at the NCS site on
 
05:49:42.788 --> 05:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
June 27th then on August 15
 
05:49:45.868 --> 05:49:45.878 align:start position:0%
2024 um and all four of those tests that
 
05:49:50.110 --> 05:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
I conducted of the seep runoff which
 
05:49:51.628 --> 05:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
this is a picture of what it looks like
 
05:49:53.948 --> 05:49:53.958 align:start position:0%
in case you've not seen the video I did
 
05:49:58.270 --> 05:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
send video link um to two of my uh um
 
05:50:00.750 --> 05:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
sampling so you could see the force of
 
05:50:02.510 --> 05:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
the water that's coming off of that
 
05:50:05.670 --> 05:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
property into the amusic river and my
 
05:50:10.468 --> 05:50:10.478 align:start position:0%
lab reports showed consistent levels of
 
05:50:12.468 --> 05:50:12.478 align:start position:0%
contamination with the further
 
05:50:15.750 --> 05:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
upgradient um monitoring Wells
 
05:50:19.670 --> 05:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
particularly the b304 well couplet and
 
05:50:23.830 --> 05:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
the um actually there's a new well uh B
 
05:50:23.840 --> 05:50:26.030 align:start position:0%
the um actually there's a new well uh B
uh

05:50:26.030 --> 05:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:50:29.390 --> 05:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
932 that is closer to the amusic river
 
05:50:32.708 --> 05:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
part of the SSI investigation uh of the
 
05:50:34.948 --> 05:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
property and that has also shown these
 
05:50:37.230 --> 05:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
same um four
 
05:50:40.070 --> 05:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
at least four posos compounds but I will
 
05:50:43.070 --> 05:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
say that um part of the placard that I
 
05:50:46.390 --> 05:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
had was part of a mockup I did using the
 
05:50:51.230 --> 05:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
July 2024 monitoring um results uh
 
05:50:54.868 --> 05:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
submitted to Dees showing a 78% increase
 
05:50:58.150 --> 05:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
in total posos levels from prior testing
 
05:51:01.030 --> 05:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
with seven Wells showing new firsttime
 
05:51:03.230 --> 05:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
initial posos detections at that
 
05:51:06.310 --> 05:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
facility as well as 17 and now I correct
 
05:51:08.230 --> 05:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
that because there's a new well that was
 
05:51:10.270 --> 05:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
installed in November that is also in
 
05:51:14.110 --> 05:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
your packet 18 Wells at that property
 
05:51:17.430 --> 05:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
with um pooa detections and I don't know
 
05:51:19.590 --> 05:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
if you're familiar with pooa but that is
 
05:51:22.070 --> 05:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
one of the two posos compounds that the
 
05:51:24.548 --> 05:51:24.558 align:start position:0%
EPA just deemed as a hazardous uh
 
05:51:26.430 --> 05:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
substance in uh
 
05:51:30.510 --> 05:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
2024 um so this facility has a serious
 
05:51:34.110 --> 05:51:34.120 align:start position:0%
pfoa problem and I guess really again
 
05:51:35.948 --> 05:51:35.958 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to read my testimony to
 
05:51:38.030 --> 05:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
you but I would ask I did have a
 
05:51:40.548 --> 05:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
question for the committee and perhaps
 
05:51:42.628 --> 05:51:42.638 align:start position:0%
you can even ask this of the department
 
05:51:46.628 --> 05:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
but are you okay knowing that an
 
05:51:49.948 --> 05:51:49.958 align:start position:0%
existing operational landfill is allowed
 
05:51:52.628 --> 05:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
to continue to operate while its own
 
05:51:54.910 --> 05:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
groundwater monitoring reports have
 
05:51:57.910 --> 05:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
consistently shown widespread and
 
05:52:01.030 --> 05:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
ongoing posos contamination of the
 
05:52:03.948 --> 05:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
surrounding property including the
 
05:52:08.110 --> 05:52:08.120 align:start position:0%
Watershed of the amk river as well as
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
the surface water runoff discharge that
 
05:52:14.070 --> 05:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
I have tested I provided you with the
 
05:52:16.590 --> 05:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
lab results I've shown I've provided you
 
05:52:19.788 --> 05:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
links to the video but are you okay with
 
05:52:21.910 --> 05:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
that continuing
 
05:52:25.310 --> 05:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
today so with that I'll
 
05:52:27.830 --> 05:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh take any questions if you have any
 
05:52:30.948 --> 05:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Swan any questions seeing
 
05:52:33.350 --> 05:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much for coming this
 
05:52:35.310 --> 05:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon I'd like to call Wayne
 
05:52:35.320 --> 05:52:38.110 align:start position:0%
afternoon I'd like to call Wayne
Morrison

05:52:38.110 --> 05:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
Morrison
 
05:52:40.868 --> 05:52:40.878 align:start position:0%
North Country ABC and you've requested
 
05:52:40.878 --> 05:52:59.670 align:start position:0%
North Country ABC and you've requested
four

05:52:59.670 --> 05:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:02.628 --> 05:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
minutes good afternoon good
 
05:53:04.990 --> 05:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you for uh hearing my
 
05:53:06.510 --> 05:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
testimony for the record my name is
 
05:53:08.670 --> 05:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
Wayne Morrison and I am president of a
 
05:53:11.350 --> 05:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
Grassroots organization called uh North
 
05:53:13.590 --> 05:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
Country Alliance For balanc
 
05:53:17.990 --> 05:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
Change six years ago
 
05:53:21.110 --> 05:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
um when the GSL project was at its
 
05:53:23.868 --> 05:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
infancy and we've heard about it that
 
05:53:25.910 --> 05:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
event changed my
 
05:53:28.830 --> 05:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
life I and members of my group have
 
05:53:31.750 --> 05:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
spent the last six years educating
 
05:53:34.430 --> 05:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
ourselves and trying to understand what
 
05:53:37.350 --> 05:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
the rules are how they apply
 
05:53:38.670 --> 05:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
what they
 
05:53:41.910 --> 05:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
mean and that led to you know I'm a
 
05:53:43.990 --> 05:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
homeowner I'm not a
 
05:53:46.110 --> 05:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist but over the last six
 
05:53:49.110 --> 05:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
years I've hired a hydrog geologist I've
 
05:53:52.270 --> 05:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
hired a lawyer I've hired a Wetlands
 
05:53:55.190 --> 05:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
expert I've invested my time and my
 
05:53:58.390 --> 05:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
energy to try and defend what I think is
 
05:54:01.270 --> 05:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know the best interest not only of
 
05:54:04.110 --> 05:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
my own property but my neighbors and
 
05:54:07.510 --> 05:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately the people of New Hampshire
 
05:54:09.110 --> 05:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
I've come to realize that citing a
 
05:54:11.230 --> 05:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
landfill is probably the single most
 
05:54:13.868 --> 05:54:13.878 align:start position:0%
important decision in in that project's
 
05:54:16.270 --> 05:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
life there's a ton of engineering and
 
05:54:18.628 --> 05:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of complexity in the
 
05:54:20.190 --> 05:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
engineering part of the landfill and
 
05:54:21.670 --> 05:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
you'll hear a lot about double liners
 
05:54:23.830 --> 05:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
and monitoring
 
05:54:27.030 --> 05:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
Wells but where you put one of these
 
05:54:27.040 --> 05:54:28.430 align:start position:0%
Wells but where you put one of these
ultimately

05:54:28.430 --> 05:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
05:54:30.510 --> 05:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
dictates the risk that you're putting
 
05:54:32.910 --> 05:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire under and that
 
05:54:36.150 --> 05:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
risk is not for a week or a month or a
 
05:54:38.350 --> 05:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
year year or even the life of the permit
 
05:54:41.830 --> 05:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
which is say 20 years it's at risk for
 
05:54:44.430 --> 05:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
the next 100 years because even after
 
05:54:49.510 --> 05:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:52.350 --> 05:54:52.360 align:start position:0%
continue the old rules when we started
 
05:54:52.360 --> 05:54:53.670 align:start position:0%
continue the old rules when we started
said

05:54:53.670 --> 05:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
said
 
05:54:56.910 --> 05:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
that you could site a landfill within
 
05:54:59.350 --> 05:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
200 feet of Water's
 
05:55:02.190 --> 05:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
Edge when I first heard
 
05:55:05.990 --> 05:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
that just a a nobody dumb person living
 
05:55:08.468 --> 05:55:08.478 align:start position:0%
on a a beautiful Lake up north I said
 
05:55:09.390 --> 05:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
that can't
 
05:55:12.628 --> 05:55:12.638 align:start position:0%
be two-thirds of a football field is not
 
05:55:14.830 --> 05:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
is not the protection I'm looking for
 
05:55:17.590 --> 05:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
and not just from my site but
 
05:55:22.590 --> 05:55:22.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere after a number of iterations
 
05:55:24.910 --> 05:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
conversations a year of rules being
 
05:55:27.070 --> 05:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
reviewed feedback being
 
05:55:31.150 --> 05:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
given that rule today is 500
 
05:55:34.230 --> 05:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
feet and that's if the river is big
 
05:55:35.788 --> 05:55:35.798 align:start position:0%
enough I guess if it's a smaller River
 
05:55:38.670 --> 05:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
it's still 200
 
05:55:41.390 --> 05:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
ft as Governor aot said when she came
 
05:55:44.110 --> 05:55:44.120 align:start position:0%
and visited Forest Lake she said this
 
05:55:46.708 --> 05:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
makes no
 
05:55:49.230 --> 05:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
sense that comment resonates with me
 
05:55:51.990 --> 05:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
because I think it makes no
 
05:55:55.070 --> 05:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
sense 200 feet or 500 feet it's hard to
 
05:55:56.990 --> 05:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
argue that 500 feet is more than 200
 
05:55:58.948 --> 05:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
feet but both of those numbers in
 
05:56:00.230 --> 05:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
reality are
 
05:56:02.310 --> 05:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
meaningless the reason that we need
 
05:56:05.830 --> 05:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
sight specific science-based setbacks
 
05:56:08.868 --> 05:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
are because the geology the hydrogeology
 
05:56:10.590 --> 05:56:10.600 align:start position:0%
of every site is
 
05:56:13.708 --> 05:56:13.718 align:start position:0%
different and we don't know if 500 ft is
 
05:56:16.070 --> 05:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
sufficient and we won't know unless we
 
05:56:19.830 --> 05:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
test the soil and this whole time of
 
05:56:23.390 --> 05:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
travel is an interesting concept what we
 
05:56:25.030 --> 05:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
want is a margin of
 
05:56:27.830 --> 05:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
error we want enough we want enough time
 
05:56:30.590 --> 05:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
if there's an accident
 
05:56:34.750 --> 05:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
and I think dees are good people trying
 
05:56:38.030 --> 05:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing this is not me
 
05:56:40.750 --> 05:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
shooting uh bullets at they put a year
 
05:56:42.670 --> 05:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
into trying to update the rules it's a
 
05:56:44.270 --> 05:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
lot of hard work and nobody likes your
 
05:56:46.830 --> 05:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
work when you're done I get all of
 
05:56:49.628 --> 05:56:49.638 align:start position:0%
that but I think the most important
 
05:56:51.590 --> 05:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
element of all the rules that we talk
 
05:56:55.350 --> 05:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
about is the sighting piece and and how
 
05:56:59.070 --> 05:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
far you you put the landfill facility
 
05:57:03.070 --> 05:57:03.080 align:start position:0%
away from whether it's my Lake a river
 
05:57:05.910 --> 05:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
the Atlantic Ocean or a drinking water
 
05:57:08.510 --> 05:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
supp Supply is critical I think this is
 
05:57:10.788 --> 05:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
a common sense approach to use science
 
05:57:12.750 --> 05:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
to determine
 
05:57:16.990 --> 05:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
that I think the simple concept is
 
05:57:20.030 --> 05:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
that the more porous the soil the
 
05:57:22.830 --> 05:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
further back from water you should be
 
05:57:25.310 --> 05:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
that's not that complicated you don't
 
05:57:28.190 --> 05:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
have to be a hydrogeologist to
 
05:57:31.868 --> 05:57:31.878 align:start position:0%
recognize that despite our best efforts
 
05:57:33.990 --> 05:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
despite double liners and monitoring
 
05:57:37.548 --> 05:57:37.558 align:start position:0%
Wells and and high engineered
 
05:57:40.350 --> 05:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
systems at the end of the day
 
05:57:45.070 --> 05:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately happens people make
 
05:57:48.830 --> 05:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:53.030 --> 05:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:57.230 --> 05:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
break I I think at some level what we're
 
05:58:00.750 --> 05:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:03.030 --> 05:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
recognize that
 
05:58:05.590 --> 05:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
risk and that how our lakes and our
 
05:58:07.350 --> 05:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
Rivers and our water bodies and our
 
05:58:09.510 --> 05:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
drinking supplies are
 
05:58:11.788 --> 05:58:11.798 align:start position:0%
irreplaceable they are the engine that's
 
05:58:17.150 --> 05:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
driving our economic boom in the North
 
05:58:19.190 --> 05:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
Country they're critical to our
 
05:58:21.788 --> 05:58:21.798 align:start position:0%
long-term health and our long-term
 
05:58:25.430 --> 05:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
success when we talk about this sighting
 
05:58:28.788 --> 05:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
criteria 5 years versus 500 feet 500
 
05:58:31.788 --> 05:58:31.798 align:start position:0%
feet is an arbitrary number we might
 
05:58:33.830 --> 05:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
debate forever the mechanics of how you
 
05:58:36.230 --> 05:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
come up with is it 10 the minus 5 is at
 
05:58:38.430 --> 05:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
10 Theus
 
05:58:41.468 --> 05:58:41.478 align:start position:0%
4 but coming up with a distance that
 
05:58:44.750 --> 05:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
allows us enough time to First detect
 
05:58:46.830 --> 05:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
intercept and remediate a problem before
 
05:58:49.468 --> 05:58:49.478 align:start position:0%
it hits the water is what we're talking
 
05:58:51.868 --> 05:58:51.878 align:start position:0%
about and why wouldn't we a on the side
 
05:58:54.430 --> 05:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
of caution I think we should continue to
 
05:58:56.948 --> 05:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
drive for all the best practices in the
 
05:58:58.350 --> 05:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
design of the
 
05:59:01.548 --> 05:59:01.558 align:start position:0%
landfill but at the end of the day I
 
05:59:03.750 --> 05:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
would ask this committee as I would ask
 
05:59:05.628 --> 05:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
anybody I speak to about this this
 
05:59:05.638 --> 05:59:07.350 align:start position:0%
anybody I speak to about this this
subject

05:59:07.350 --> 05:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
subject
 
05:59:09.910 --> 05:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
we should assume at some point the
 
05:59:12.070 --> 05:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
landfill is going to
 
05:59:15.150 --> 05:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
fail and when it does the only thing
 
05:59:18.190 --> 05:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
protecting us is that sighting criteria
 
05:59:20.708 --> 05:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
that sets it back far enough to prevent
 
05:59:23.548 --> 05:59:23.558 align:start position:0%
the problem from becoming
 
05:59:26.190 --> 05:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
irreversible when leech a hits a hits a
 
05:59:28.190 --> 05:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
lake there is no
 
05:59:33.430 --> 05:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
remediation there's no fixing that it's
 
05:59:35.310 --> 05:59:35.320 align:start position:0%
over I don't know how many more
 
05:59:36.510 --> 05:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
landfills we're going going to need in
 
05:59:36.520 --> 05:59:38.270 align:start position:0%
landfills we're going going to need in
New

05:59:38.270 --> 05:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:59:40.110 --> 05:59:40.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now I don't think we
 
05:59:42.110 --> 05:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
need one at all but if we do down the
 
05:59:44.670 --> 05:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
road we should be very cautious about
 
05:59:46.548 --> 05:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
where we put it that is the most
 
05:59:48.670 --> 05:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
important thing we can
 
05:59:52.510 --> 05:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
decide and I think what jel car I walked
 
05:59:55.468 --> 05:59:55.478 align:start position:0%
away disappointed that the rules weren't
 
05:59:57.590 --> 05:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
to my liking they weren't strong as I
 
06:00:00.270 --> 06:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
would like them but what resonated with
 
06:00:03.948 --> 06:00:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:06.548 --> 06:00:06.558 align:start position:0%
decision Dees has a lot of great people
 
06:00:08.548 --> 06:00:08.558 align:start position:0%
they're in The Fray every
 
06:00:11.310 --> 06:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
day but somewhere along the line the
 
06:00:13.190 --> 06:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
legislature has to weigh in and say you
 
06:00:13.200 --> 06:00:14.030 align:start position:0%
legislature has to weigh in and say you
know

06:00:14.030 --> 06:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:00:18.868 --> 06:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
what it is our view that we need to be
 
06:00:18.878 --> 06:00:20.230 align:start position:0%
what it is our view that we need to be
extremely

06:00:20.230 --> 06:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
06:00:23.030 --> 06:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
cautious we need to air on the side of
 
06:00:25.510 --> 06:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
if there's a failure do we have enough
 
06:00:28.468 --> 06:00:28.478 align:start position:0%
separation between that site and a water
 
06:00:30.788 --> 06:00:30.798 align:start position:0%
supply that's all we're
 
06:00:33.990 --> 06:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
asking this is you can make this
 
06:00:36.150 --> 06:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
extremely complicated there's a lot of
 
06:00:38.468 --> 06:00:38.478 align:start position:0%
math there's a lot of science at the end
 
06:00:42.310 --> 06:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
of the day when I stand on my Dock and I
 
06:00:45.750 --> 06:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
look across and I say a huge landfill is
 
06:00:47.750 --> 06:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
going to be within sight within less
 
06:00:50.350 --> 06:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
than a half a mile from my
 
06:00:52.868 --> 06:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
Lake I just can't believe that's that's
 
06:00:54.670 --> 06:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
the best practice that's the best that
 
06:00:57.948 --> 06:00:57.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can offer its citizens it
 
06:01:01.110 --> 06:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
makes no sense and as governor governor
 
06:01:01.120 --> 06:01:02.350 align:start position:0%
makes no sense and as governor governor
aot

06:01:02.350 --> 06:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
aot
 
06:01:06.868 --> 06:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:09.230 --> 06:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
it it's an important time for us right
 
06:01:11.070 --> 06:01:11.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that it makes no sense
 
06:01:14.150 --> 06:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
coincides with we have ignored this
 
06:01:17.110 --> 06:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
issue for the better part of the last 20
 
06:01:19.548 --> 06:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
years the good news is we haven't had a
 
06:01:19.558 --> 06:01:21.030 align:start position:0%
years the good news is we haven't had a
new

06:01:21.030 --> 06:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
new
 
06:01:23.430 --> 06:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
landfill nobody can remember when we had
 
06:01:25.110 --> 06:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
a new landfill it's all been expansions
 
06:01:26.628 --> 06:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
it's all been Town dumps that have been
 
06:01:28.270 --> 06:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
bought and
 
06:01:30.590 --> 06:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
expanded we need a place to start and
 
06:01:32.270 --> 06:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
the time to start is
 
06:01:35.548 --> 06:01:35.558 align:start position:0%
now and I I I think before we get lost
 
06:01:37.910 --> 06:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
to the minutia of who shot who and how
 
06:01:40.150 --> 06:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
and and what what are all the individual
 
06:01:41.430 --> 06:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
how do you do this and how do you do
 
06:01:42.788 --> 06:01:42.798 align:start position:0%
that there's people that can figure that
 
06:01:46.150 --> 06:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
out but the policy part the part that
 
06:01:48.390 --> 06:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
really matters is the legislators
 
06:01:51.510 --> 06:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
standing up and saying we need to do
 
06:01:54.070 --> 06:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
better we need to be more protective and
 
06:01:56.868 --> 06:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
the time to do that is now and I'm here
 
06:01:59.310 --> 06:01:59.320 align:start position:0%
to say I support this bill there may be
 
06:02:00.910 --> 06:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
warts and pimples on it maybe there
 
06:02:03.270 --> 06:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be some amendments but the
 
06:02:05.070 --> 06:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
heart of this bill is the right thing
 
06:02:06.788 --> 06:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and now's the right
 
06:02:09.670 --> 06:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
time to implement it and I I urge you to
 
06:02:11.150 --> 06:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
work through this and get this
 
06:02:13.510 --> 06:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
legislation through thank you thank you
 
06:02:13.520 --> 06:02:15.270 align:start position:0%
legislation through thank you thank you
any

06:02:15.270 --> 06:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:02:18.910 --> 06:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much Mr
 
06:02:25.548 --> 06:02:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:28.510 --> 06:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
manzelli yeah I hope you're not going to
 
06:02:34.270 --> 06:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:37.830 --> 06:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
do and uh I I want to just be cognizant
 
06:02:40.990 --> 06:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
of the time please thank you thank you
 
06:02:43.310 --> 06:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair members of the
 
06:02:46.150 --> 06:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Amy manzelli
 
06:02:48.430 --> 06:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
from BCM environmental and land law
 
06:02:50.390 --> 06:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
where I am a lawyer and I'm here
 
06:02:52.548 --> 06:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
representing North Country Alliance for
 
06:02:55.830 --> 06:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
balance change as their Council uh in
 
06:02:58.750 --> 06:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
strong support of House Bill
 
06:03:01.150 --> 06:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
707 and I primarily want to talk with
 
06:03:05.990 --> 06:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
you about how this bill brings a modern
 
06:03:10.110 --> 06:03:10.120 align:start position:0%
scientific approach to citing
 
06:03:13.430 --> 06:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
landfills so I'm basically just going to
 
06:03:16.548 --> 06:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
give you an orientation to the materials
 
06:03:18.948 --> 06:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
that I've submitted um I did bring one
 
06:03:23.868 --> 06:03:23.878 align:start position:0%
hard copy this this is just one copy um
 
06:03:26.468 --> 06:03:26.478 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of uh doing what representative
 
06:03:29.750 --> 06:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
Penza threaten to do which is providing
 
06:03:32.270 --> 06:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
all of the voluminous science in support
 
06:03:32.280 --> 06:03:33.628 align:start position:0%
all of the voluminous science in support
of

06:03:33.628 --> 06:03:33.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:03:36.390 --> 06:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
hb77 um and I'm not going to read it
 
06:03:38.628 --> 06:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
we're just going to hit the highlights
 
06:03:39.868 --> 06:03:39.878 align:start position:0%
before I do that though I want to
 
06:03:42.310 --> 06:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
provide further answer to the question
 
06:03:46.350 --> 06:03:46.360 align:start position:0%
about why do we need a site specific
 
06:03:48.788 --> 06:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
setback when New Hampshire has a double
 
06:03:48.798 --> 06:03:49.868 align:start position:0%
setback when New Hampshire has a double
liner

06:03:49.868 --> 06:03:49.878 align:start position:0%
liner
 
06:03:54.708 --> 06:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
requirement so um what happened at ncees
 
06:03:56.310 --> 06:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
the landfill that's operated in
 
06:03:58.468 --> 06:03:58.478 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem may may I stop you a minute
 
06:04:00.910 --> 06:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
because that that actually wasn't my
 
06:04:05.030 --> 06:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
comment or question um I I questioned
 
06:04:06.548 --> 06:04:06.558 align:start position:0%
the um
 
06:04:11.670 --> 06:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
minus5 number with regard to comparison
 
06:04:14.708 --> 06:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
with other states that don't have a
 
06:04:16.190 --> 06:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
double liner
 
06:04:18.190 --> 06:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
requirement so
 
06:04:21.468 --> 06:04:21.478 align:start position:0%
they're they're set not not setback but
 
06:04:24.468 --> 06:04:24.478 align:start position:0%
their travel time is a lot more
 
06:04:26.628 --> 06:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
stringent because they don't have a
 
06:04:28.990 --> 06:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
double liner requirement that's what I
 
06:04:32.230 --> 06:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
was um referring to yep no I I
 
06:04:33.070 --> 06:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
understand and thank you for the
 
06:04:36.230 --> 06:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
clarification chair um but I did want to
 
06:04:39.868 --> 06:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
explain the nature of the liner failure
 
06:04:41.868 --> 06:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
um because that is part of the answer it
 
06:04:44.390 --> 06:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter how many liners you have
 
06:04:47.270 --> 06:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's one or a double or perhaps
 
06:04:50.350 --> 06:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
more than that um not only do they fail
 
06:04:52.788 --> 06:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
in and of themselves there's also
 
06:04:54.910 --> 06:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
operator error and that's what happened
 
06:04:54.920 --> 06:04:55.590 align:start position:0%
operator error and that's what happened
at

06:04:55.590 --> 06:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
at
 
06:05:00.510 --> 06:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
ncees so um over 11 years
 
06:05:04.390 --> 06:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
ago uh cassella the operating the parent
 
06:05:05.910 --> 06:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
company there was having monitor ing
 
06:05:09.230 --> 06:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
Wells installed and their contractors
 
06:05:13.310 --> 06:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
drilled holes right through an overliner
 
06:05:16.070 --> 06:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
and it took 10 years for anyone to
 
06:05:19.910 --> 06:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
figure it out and so last year they
 
06:05:24.868 --> 06:05:24.878 align:start position:0%
reported 10 years worth of a leak and
 
06:05:27.110 --> 06:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
that is not uncommon in landfill
 
06:05:29.750 --> 06:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
operation situations so when we're here
 
06:05:32.390 --> 06:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
talking about the need for a fiveyear
 
06:05:35.430 --> 06:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
setback that's a real world example why
 
06:05:37.708 --> 06:05:37.718 align:start position:0%
and there's another component of why we
 
06:05:41.590 --> 06:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
need a time-based setback um even if
 
06:05:43.990 --> 06:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
there's a double liner requirement and
 
06:05:47.230 --> 06:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
that's because most of the leachate
 
06:05:49.948 --> 06:05:49.958 align:start position:0%
handling operations at a solid waste
 
06:05:53.190 --> 06:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
facility are completely separate from
 
06:05:55.948 --> 06:05:55.958 align:start position:0%
the area where there's a liner so the
 
06:05:59.030 --> 06:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
liner is where uh you know the big hole
 
06:06:00.670 --> 06:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
is right there's the big hole where you
 
06:06:02.270 --> 06:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
put the trash that's where the single or
 
06:06:05.030 --> 06:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
double liner is and then there are other
 
06:06:08.468 --> 06:06:08.478 align:start position:0%
parts of the facility where uh the leee
 
06:06:10.670 --> 06:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
tank uh tanker truck is getting filled
 
06:06:12.548 --> 06:06:12.558 align:start position:0%
up and driving
 
06:06:16.510 --> 06:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
out there's no liner under that area so
 
06:06:20.548 --> 06:06:20.558 align:start position:0%
if there's um a leak there there's no
 
06:06:23.150 --> 06:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
double or single liner protection so I
 
06:06:25.350 --> 06:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add those
 
06:06:29.190 --> 06:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
clarifications all right so what we're
 
06:06:31.110 --> 06:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
endeavoring to do with this very
 
06:06:32.750 --> 06:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
voluminous package which you all have in
 
06:06:36.070 --> 06:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
your email is we want to give you you
 
06:06:39.270 --> 06:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
everything you need to support and
 
06:06:41.628 --> 06:06:41.638 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on with
 
06:06:44.868 --> 06:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
hb77 so that you will vote OTP which is
 
06:06:48.350 --> 06:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
what we are strongly urging you to do um
 
06:06:49.910 --> 06:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
we know this is the first time this
 
06:06:51.868 --> 06:06:51.878 align:start position:0%
committee is considering this particular
 
06:06:53.548 --> 06:06:53.558 align:start position:0%
bill so as I said I'm just going to kind
 
06:06:55.510 --> 06:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
of give you a walk through here not a
 
06:06:58.788 --> 06:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
deep dive um everybody else has talked
 
06:07:00.788 --> 06:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
about the process as to how we got here
 
06:07:03.310 --> 06:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
but in some you know what we heard from
 
06:07:05.948 --> 06:07:05.958 align:start position:0%
both the department and jail car is
 
06:07:07.510 --> 06:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
these are policy changes that the
 
06:07:11.510 --> 06:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
legislature has to make so here we are
 
06:07:14.468 --> 06:07:14.478 align:start position:0%
um we talk about the uh North Country
 
06:07:17.230 --> 06:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
Alliance for balance change team and so
 
06:07:19.948 --> 06:07:19.958 align:start position:0%
these resources include input from our
 
06:07:23.150 --> 06:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist Muriel robinet our civil
 
06:07:26.190 --> 06:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
engineer honor Bond day um as well as
 
06:07:29.548 --> 06:07:29.558 align:start position:0%
myself and the ncbac team which is
 
06:07:31.548 --> 06:07:31.558 align:start position:0%
comprised of their board and
 
06:07:34.910 --> 06:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
members and as as Mr Morrison said we
 
06:07:38.150 --> 06:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
have been this for a number of years and
 
06:07:39.590 --> 06:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
have by virtue of that gotten pretty
 
06:07:41.110 --> 06:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
well versed in these
 
06:07:45.590 --> 06:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
issues so there's an exhibit a and what
 
06:07:49.270 --> 06:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
that does is it Compares what were the
 
06:07:52.910 --> 06:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
prior rules which uh with what are the
 
06:07:57.110 --> 06:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
current rules and it breaks it down with
 
06:08:02.390 --> 06:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
red uh green and yellow um you'll see
 
06:08:06.350 --> 06:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
that as your first exhibit red is where
 
06:08:08.468 --> 06:08:08.478 align:start position:0%
the rule got weaker green is where the
 
06:08:10.510 --> 06:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
rule got stronger yellow is where the
 
06:08:13.110 --> 06:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
change was essentially neutral and we've
 
06:08:16.468 --> 06:08:16.478 align:start position:0%
provided some analysis that uh
 
06:08:18.628 --> 06:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
explains what the nature of the
 
06:08:20.590 --> 06:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
technical change was and all that
 
06:08:23.150 --> 06:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
analysis comes from our hydrogeologist
 
06:08:25.030 --> 06:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
and our civil
 
06:08:27.910 --> 06:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
engineer the next thing which is the
 
06:08:33.070 --> 06:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
bulk it's about 350 Pages it's exhibit B
 
06:08:35.990 --> 06:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
and what that is is study
 
06:08:41.110 --> 06:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
after study after study of peer reviewed
 
06:08:44.628 --> 06:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
science that supports that something in
 
06:08:48.548 --> 06:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
the range of a 10 to the4 or a 10 to
 
06:08:54.750 --> 06:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
the5 is the modern gold standard for
 
06:08:58.750 --> 06:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
landfill sighting setback hydraulic
 
06:09:02.430 --> 06:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
conductivity Mr Morrison said it just as
 
06:09:04.548 --> 06:09:04.558 align:start position:0%
plain English as you can get you know if
 
06:09:06.230 --> 06:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to have le leaking through
 
06:09:09.948 --> 06:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
sand versus lee8 leaking through clay
 
06:09:13.628 --> 06:09:13.638 align:start position:0%
clay is obviously better uh that's how a
 
06:09:15.590 --> 06:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
non-scientist would talk about it but we
 
06:09:17.708 --> 06:09:17.718 align:start position:0%
are giving you the peer-reviewed science
 
06:09:19.990 --> 06:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
so you yourselves can become familiar
 
06:09:20.000 --> 06:09:22.390 align:start position:0%
so you yourselves can become familiar
with

06:09:22.390 --> 06:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:26.390 --> 06:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
this and then the last thing is the
 
06:09:29.628 --> 06:09:29.638 align:start position:0%
multi-state survey so we've actually
 
06:09:32.310 --> 06:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
provided you with the sighting
 
06:09:35.030 --> 06:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
requirements the New Hampshire law and
 
06:09:37.670 --> 06:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
then Maine Vermont Massachusetts and
 
06:09:40.910 --> 06:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island analoges of those sighting
 
06:09:43.548 --> 06:09:43.558 align:start position:0%
requirements so instead of just sort of
 
06:09:44.670 --> 06:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
I mean it's important to make the
 
06:09:46.990 --> 06:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
statement that New Hampshire's laws are
 
06:09:50.110 --> 06:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
the weakest in the region and Beyond but
 
06:09:52.590 --> 06:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
I wanted you as the committee to have
 
06:09:54.390 --> 06:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
those resources right at your fingertips
 
06:09:56.708 --> 06:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
so if you want to look up any of those
 
06:10:07.390 --> 06:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:10.510 --> 06:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
um again being mindful of the time I
 
06:10:12.070 --> 06:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
don't have anything further to add
 
06:10:14.468 --> 06:10:14.478 align:start position:0%
except to say North Country Alliance for
 
06:10:16.750 --> 06:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
balance change wants to be a resource
 
06:10:19.230 --> 06:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
for this committee should you have any
 
06:10:21.670 --> 06:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
questions right this second I would be
 
06:10:23.590 --> 06:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
very eager to answer them and should you
 
06:10:25.310 --> 06:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
have any requests or any further
 
06:10:27.830 --> 06:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
resources we would be happy to provide
 
06:10:30.670 --> 06:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
those thank you okay thank you very very
 
06:10:32.830 --> 06:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony representative
 
06:10:35.628 --> 06:10:35.638 align:start position:0%
King then representative wheeler thank
 
06:10:36.990 --> 06:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
06:10:40.230 --> 06:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
questions how much participation did NC
 
06:10:43.708 --> 06:10:43.718 align:start position:0%
ABC have in the crafting of this
 
06:10:49.990 --> 06:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
bill um I actually I personally had none
 
06:10:52.750 --> 06:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know the answer to that
 
06:10:56.310 --> 06:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
please hold Tom are you
 
06:10:58.390 --> 06:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
testifying okay or Wayne could you
 
06:10:58.400 --> 06:11:10.948 align:start position:0%
testifying okay or Wayne could you
answer

06:11:10.948 --> 06:11:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:13.270 --> 06:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
and I can reiterate are we would Madam
 
06:11:16.070 --> 06:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
chair may he join me he may join you but
 
06:11:21.430 --> 06:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:23.830 --> 06:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
yep the answer to your question is we
 
06:11:26.110 --> 06:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
we've had some part some involvement in
 
06:11:29.430 --> 06:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
the bill um and it's that bill it's it's
 
06:11:32.548 --> 06:11:32.558 align:start position:0%
it's been in um multiple iterations so
 
06:11:34.510 --> 06:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
over over time the bill has matured
 
06:11:36.670 --> 06:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
we've learned more or so there's been
 
06:11:38.270 --> 06:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
there's been a number of different
 
06:11:40.510 --> 06:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
people involved in writing the bill and
 
06:11:42.230 --> 06:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's been written primarily by
 
06:11:44.590 --> 06:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
scientists so we've had Layman's
 
06:11:46.788 --> 06:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
involvement but it came from the science
 
06:11:48.310 --> 06:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
Community thank you thank you
 
06:11:50.990 --> 06:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you madam
 
06:11:53.830 --> 06:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
chair uh and thank you madam for taking
 
06:11:56.628 --> 06:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
my question I guess I'm wondering uh do
 
06:12:00.030 --> 06:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
you and others feel like the common
 
06:12:01.468 --> 06:12:01.478 align:start position:0%
sense approach that you tried to bring
 
06:12:03.190 --> 06:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
to the rules process do you feel like
 
06:12:05.990 --> 06:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
you were listened to respectfully
 
06:12:08.708 --> 06:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
throughout that process do people uh in
 
06:12:10.548 --> 06:12:10.558 align:start position:0%
the North Country Alliance for balance
 
06:12:12.628 --> 06:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
change feel like they were respectfully
 
06:12:14.230 --> 06:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
listened to and their concerns were
 
06:12:16.310 --> 06:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
heard when they tried to bring that to
 
06:12:18.708 --> 06:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
the process um I think those are two
 
06:12:21.390 --> 06:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
different questions there's certainly
 
06:12:23.990 --> 06:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
has been a lot of process and there has
 
06:12:27.190 --> 06:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
been a high amount of decorum and
 
06:12:31.190 --> 06:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
respect in the process um but
 
06:12:34.548 --> 06:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
meaningfully heard no I don't think that
 
06:12:37.868 --> 06:12:37.878 align:start position:0%
we have been meaningfully heard um but I
 
06:12:40.868 --> 06:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
do think that the
 
06:12:44.548 --> 06:12:44.558 align:start position:0%
reason uh provided being
 
06:12:47.350 --> 06:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
that mostly these are policy level
 
06:12:50.110 --> 06:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
changes for the legislature to make I
 
06:12:53.070 --> 06:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:55.990 --> 06:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
reason representative ger thank you
 
06:12:57.750 --> 06:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
06:12:59.948 --> 06:12:59.958 align:start position:0%
question so as you know one of the
 
06:13:03.628 --> 06:13:03.638 align:start position:0%
changes to the rules late in the game
 
06:13:05.390 --> 06:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
after a lot of after all all of the
 
06:13:08.390 --> 06:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
hearings in public input was to say that
 
06:13:10.708 --> 06:13:10.718 align:start position:0%
if a site was below a certain standard
 
06:13:13.468 --> 06:13:13.478 align:start position:0%
you could bring in 24 up to 24 Ines of
 
06:13:17.350 --> 06:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
material um so I I'm wondering if you
 
06:13:18.788 --> 06:13:18.798 align:start position:0%
could comment on that I mean does that
 
06:13:21.110 --> 06:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
mean that effectively you could site a
 
06:13:24.590 --> 06:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
landfill anywhere in the state yes it
 
06:13:26.628 --> 06:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
does I believe that that is a loophole
 
06:13:28.190 --> 06:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
so big you could drive a Mac Truck
 
06:13:31.230 --> 06:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
through it thank you okay any other
 
06:13:32.670 --> 06:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
06:13:35.110 --> 06:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very very much for
 
06:13:37.830 --> 06:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
for um for providing us with a lot of
 
06:13:40.030 --> 06:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
research and information that you know
 
06:13:43.910 --> 06:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
we can certainly uh Endeavor to dig
 
06:13:46.030 --> 06:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
through thank you madam chair in L of
 
06:13:48.548 --> 06:13:48.558 align:start position:0%
ambian no problem appreciate all of uh
 
06:13:50.468 --> 06:13:50.478 align:start position:0%
your your testimony and information as
 
06:13:53.910 --> 06:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
well and if we do have questions we will
 
06:13:58.750 --> 06:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
be asking them um Dr
 
06:14:11.670 --> 06:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:13.948 --> 06:14:13.958 align:start position:0%
no press the button there there you go
 
06:14:15.788 --> 06:14:15.798 align:start position:0%
that button okay um yes hello I'm
 
06:14:18.310 --> 06:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
Cynthia Walter and I do have a doctorate
 
06:14:22.910 --> 06:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
um in in science I um am speaking I'm
 
06:14:26.350 --> 06:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
I'm from 22 West conquer Street uh NOA
 
06:14:28.868 --> 06:14:28.878 align:start position:0%
so I um hadn't planed to speak today but
 
06:14:30.230 --> 06:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
I I didn't know this bill was being
 
06:14:32.910 --> 06:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
heard at this time I have researched
 
06:14:34.628 --> 06:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
this issue and I have personal
 
06:14:38.270 --> 06:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
experience observing I'm studying uh the
 
06:14:40.948 --> 06:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
science of water pollution especially
 
06:14:43.708 --> 06:14:43.718 align:start position:0%
above ground and below ground for 35
 
06:14:46.510 --> 06:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
years in Western Pennsylvania where
 
06:14:49.390 --> 06:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
hydrology is complicated and there are
 
06:14:51.910 --> 06:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
numerous leaks from landfills and all
 
06:14:54.670 --> 06:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
coal mines and other sorts of discharges
 
06:14:56.548 --> 06:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
that do make their way into into the
 
06:15:00.110 --> 06:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
ground and then re PE appear in the um
 
06:15:02.110 --> 06:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
surface water and in people's homes and
 
06:15:05.150 --> 06:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
in their wellwater so I have seen first
 
06:15:08.230 --> 06:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
understand how the traveling of water
 
06:15:10.468 --> 06:15:10.478 align:start position:0%
from one pollution Source through the
 
06:15:12.868 --> 06:15:12.878 align:start position:0%
ground and back over into people's homes
 
06:15:15.910 --> 06:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
and into their mouths um um CAU causing
 
06:15:17.430 --> 06:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
kidney problems and all sorts of other
 
06:15:19.670 --> 06:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
issues I've seen that happen firsthand
 
06:15:22.990 --> 06:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
so I've also read the literature on um
 
06:15:25.990 --> 06:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
landfill maliner leakage and it's it's
 
06:15:28.270 --> 06:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
fascinating to see that as good as the
 
06:15:31.990 --> 06:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
newest liners are um um very well
 
06:15:35.070 --> 06:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
regarded very well published studies of
 
06:15:39.150 --> 06:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
um stress uh uh simulations that are
 
06:15:42.948 --> 06:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
done in real real structures um of
 
06:15:45.948 --> 06:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
modern landfills show failure rates can
 
06:15:49.030 --> 06:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
occur in as soon as six
 
06:15:52.788 --> 06:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
years so it happens very quickly um in
 
06:15:56.590 --> 06:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
just due to small small fragmentary um
 
06:15:58.750 --> 06:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
flaws or in the in the placement of the
 
06:16:01.910 --> 06:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
landfill um liners and so forth so the
 
06:16:03.788 --> 06:16:03.798 align:start position:0%
idea of landfills failing it's
 
06:16:07.390 --> 06:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely so for real um and the idea
 
06:16:10.150 --> 06:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
of people being impacted
 
06:16:12.948 --> 06:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
unknowingly by water that has seeped
 
06:16:15.468 --> 06:16:15.478 align:start position:0%
from One Source above ground through the
 
06:16:18.110 --> 06:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
ground traveled and then appeared
 
06:16:20.590 --> 06:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
elsewhere below ground not sorry
 
06:16:23.468 --> 06:16:23.478 align:start position:0%
elsewhere into into well Waters and into
 
06:16:26.230 --> 06:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
surface waters without those people
 
06:16:29.030 --> 06:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
knowing that that water was contaminated
 
06:16:32.510 --> 06:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
is very real the also there's a problem
 
06:16:34.350 --> 06:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
with the um and I think it's terrific I
 
06:16:35.390 --> 06:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
mean there's
 
06:16:36.628 --> 06:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
so many good things that I'm seeing in
 
06:16:39.590 --> 06:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
this belt for example the importance of
 
06:16:44.548 --> 06:16:44.558 align:start position:0%
the uh lee8 handling components being
 
06:16:48.910 --> 06:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
subject to the profile of the perimeter
 
06:16:52.190 --> 06:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
of the subject area for the hydrology
 
06:16:55.868 --> 06:16:55.878 align:start position:0%
testing those I I again I can show you
 
06:17:00.230 --> 06:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
the reports of polluted not not po water
 
06:17:03.270 --> 06:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
that was problematic being transferred
 
06:17:05.868 --> 06:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
to treatment whether it's the trucks or
 
06:17:07.830 --> 06:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's being holding tanks and
 
06:17:09.990 --> 06:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
then the the the leakage lines the
 
06:17:12.868 --> 06:17:12.878 align:start position:0%
holding tanks um um degrade whatever it
 
06:17:16.110 --> 06:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
is that problem water the leachate
 
06:17:19.230 --> 06:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
essentially in this case leaks out
 
06:17:21.270 --> 06:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
escapes on the surface or below the
 
06:17:23.628 --> 06:17:23.638 align:start position:0%
surface and there was nothing to to know
 
06:17:25.910 --> 06:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
that it was being being handled so if
 
06:17:27.910 --> 06:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
you don't have that
 
06:17:32.070 --> 06:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
space in that time to catch those leaks
 
06:17:34.350 --> 06:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
and begin to treat them if you don't
 
06:17:38.150 --> 06:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
have space or time people will suffer
 
06:17:40.788 --> 06:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
people will be poisoned and the Water
 
06:17:43.590 --> 06:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
Supplies will be damaged irretrievably
 
06:17:46.510 --> 06:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
irrevocably because once that water is
 
06:17:49.510 --> 06:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the ground and on the surface and
 
06:17:51.830 --> 06:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
reappears it's now in the sediment of
 
06:17:53.350 --> 06:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
the stream it's now in the sediment of
 
06:17:56.628 --> 06:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
the lake and you cannot clean sediments
 
06:17:58.948 --> 06:17:58.958 align:start position:0%
of lakes you cannot clean sediments of
 
06:18:01.628 --> 06:18:01.638 align:start position:0%
rivers it's a permanent part of that
 
06:18:05.310 --> 06:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
water supply forever so we have to have
 
06:18:09.030 --> 06:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
this huge margin of error um associated
 
06:18:11.350 --> 06:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
with the landfill itself and all the
 
06:18:13.590 --> 06:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
components of the landfill operations
 
06:18:16.390 --> 06:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
including lee8 handling so I I think
 
06:18:19.270 --> 06:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
this is terrific the statistical methods
 
06:18:21.310 --> 06:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
um that are mentioned as as a pro as
 
06:18:24.708 --> 06:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
used by the EPA again standard gold Bo
 
06:18:26.468 --> 06:18:26.478 align:start position:0%
talk about gold standards guys you
 
06:18:28.270 --> 06:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
really hit the mark and hit the mark
 
06:18:30.830 --> 06:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
here so I I'm just thrilled to see this
 
06:18:33.310 --> 06:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
bill show up and and know that all that
 
06:18:35.788 --> 06:18:35.798 align:start position:0%
science is so real and um thank you so
 
06:18:37.788 --> 06:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
much for listening appreciate it
 
06:18:39.548 --> 06:18:39.558 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
06:18:41.830 --> 06:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
06:18:46.030 --> 06:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
much for coming today um I have one more
 
06:18:50.110 --> 06:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
pink card and I would invite U director
 
06:18:53.190 --> 06:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
Michael whimet from New Hampshire Dees
 
06:18:55.788 --> 06:18:55.798 align:start position:0%
to come and
 
06:18:58.110 --> 06:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
speak on this
 
06:19:05.830 --> 06:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:08.510 --> 06:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
Madam chair sorry good afternoon Madam
 
06:19:10.708 --> 06:19:10.718 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee uh thanks
 
06:19:16.990 --> 06:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
for uh inviting me to speak um I uh the
 
06:19:18.590 --> 06:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh the Hampshire Department
 
06:19:20.150 --> 06:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
environmental services is not taking a
 
06:19:22.868 --> 06:19:22.878 align:start position:0%
position on this bill um but as I have
 
06:19:24.788 --> 06:19:24.798 align:start position:0%
done with a number of other bills um we
 
06:19:27.628 --> 06:19:27.638 align:start position:0%
feel that it's important to identify any
 
06:19:30.468 --> 06:19:30.478 align:start position:0%
observations or concerns um that we
 
06:19:32.030 --> 06:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
think would be of interest to the
 
06:19:33.750 --> 06:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee as they as they consider the
 
06:19:35.590 --> 06:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
bill and that's what I'm what I'm here
 
06:19:38.510 --> 06:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
to do um and then what I'll have is a a
 
06:19:40.910 --> 06:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
handful of mixture of policy and
 
06:19:43.110 --> 06:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
technical issues that in our review of
 
06:19:46.670 --> 06:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
the bill we've identified so first off
 
06:19:49.390 --> 06:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
um regarding section three of the bill
 
06:19:52.070 --> 06:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
that establishes the setback from um and
 
06:19:56.070 --> 06:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
I use the term portable water aquafer um
 
06:19:58.670 --> 06:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
what line is that and what page um well
 
06:20:01.708 --> 06:20:01.718 align:start position:0%
it's the whole section but I can let's
 
06:20:06.750 --> 06:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
see uh page page one um L okay gotcha
 
06:20:08.868 --> 06:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah so that that whole
 
06:20:10.468 --> 06:20:10.478 align:start position:0%
section three it makes reference in the
 
06:20:13.548 --> 06:20:13.558 align:start position:0%
I think in the first paragraph to
 
06:20:16.190 --> 06:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
um the location of the facility relative
 
06:20:18.910 --> 06:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
to a portable water aquifer and this is
 
06:20:21.708 --> 06:20:21.718 align:start position:0%
really just a technical issue everybody
 
06:20:23.390 --> 06:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
has a different idea what an aquafer is
 
06:20:25.830 --> 06:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
for some people an aquafer is the ugala
 
06:20:27.468 --> 06:20:27.478 align:start position:0%
aquafer out in the midwest that provides
 
06:20:29.150 --> 06:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
you know covers several States and
 
06:20:31.788 --> 06:20:31.798 align:start position:0%
provides water to thousands of people um
 
06:20:34.190 --> 06:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
but the hydrogeologist definition of an
 
06:20:35.910 --> 06:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
aquafer is is very Broad and it
 
06:20:38.230 --> 06:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
basically means any formation water
 
06:20:41.270 --> 06:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
bearing formation that can provide water
 
06:20:43.868 --> 06:20:43.878 align:start position:0%
um to a user and that user could be an
 
06:20:47.310 --> 06:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
individual home well um and potable just
 
06:20:51.948 --> 06:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
means it's basically safe to drink so um
 
06:20:54.910 --> 06:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
almost any landfill site that a new site
 
06:20:56.910 --> 06:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
a greenfields landfill sighting is
 
06:20:59.628 --> 06:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
likely to overly something you could def
 
06:21:01.390 --> 06:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
with that definition you could Define as
 
06:21:04.390 --> 06:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
an aquafer so just as you in order for
 
06:21:06.150 --> 06:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
that section to be implementable I think
 
06:21:07.350 --> 06:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
there would need to be a little bit of
 
06:21:10.590 --> 06:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
more um exposition to explain or
 
06:21:12.270 --> 06:21:12.280 align:start position:0%
definition a clearer definition of what
 
06:21:15.590 --> 06:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
it means um and to talk about the
 
06:21:17.990 --> 06:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
location of that site relative to a
 
06:21:19.830 --> 06:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
pable water aquifer so again that's
 
06:21:24.910 --> 06:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:30.468 --> 06:21:30.478 align:start position:0%
um also um that same section makes
 
06:21:32.468 --> 06:21:32.478 align:start position:0%
existing facilities
 
06:21:35.830 --> 06:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
exempt um from the requirements and this
 
06:21:37.910 --> 06:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
is just this is a general observation
 
06:21:39.990 --> 06:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
that the department has raised in the
 
06:21:42.548 --> 06:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
context of a number of bills and we've
 
06:21:45.350 --> 06:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
made generally we there are times when I
 
06:21:46.990 --> 06:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
think it's appropriate to exempt an
 
06:21:48.548 --> 06:21:48.558 align:start position:0%
existing facility from a particular
 
06:21:49.990 --> 06:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
requirement particularly when it's just
 
06:21:52.150 --> 06:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
impracticable to implement it but where
 
06:21:53.548 --> 06:21:53.558 align:start position:0%
we're talking about potentially
 
06:21:56.030 --> 06:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
expanding existing facilities it's not
 
06:21:59.310 --> 06:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
clear to the department why the members
 
06:22:01.990 --> 06:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
of a community where a facility exists
 
06:22:04.628 --> 06:22:04.638 align:start position:0%
deserve less less protective condition
 
06:22:06.510 --> 06:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
conditions than the members of community
 
06:22:08.230 --> 06:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
where a new facility is being proposed
 
06:22:10.510 --> 06:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm not even sure where we would be
 
06:22:12.150 --> 06:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
on that but I I just want to raise it I
 
06:22:14.430 --> 06:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
think it's a question that that is
 
06:22:16.430 --> 06:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
worthy of of consideration when you when
 
06:22:21.030 --> 06:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
you look at a bill like this um also on
 
06:22:25.310 --> 06:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh page two lines 1 through five it uses
 
06:22:29.468 --> 06:22:29.478 align:start position:0%
the term maximum seepage velocity and um
 
06:22:30.990 --> 06:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
in the context where it's used there
 
06:22:33.310 --> 06:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
it's unclear whether that's a macroscale
 
06:22:35.150 --> 06:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the
 
06:22:37.350 --> 06:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
or a single location measurement and if
 
06:22:39.670 --> 06:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's the ladder um it seems that it
 
06:22:41.750 --> 06:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
could exclude virtually any site due to
 
06:22:44.110 --> 06:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
a relative the presence of a relatively
 
06:22:46.910 --> 06:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
small area or volume of a particular
 
06:22:50.788 --> 06:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
soil type so um and that may not be
 
06:22:52.948 --> 06:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
either could be neither contiguous nor
 
06:22:54.788 --> 06:22:54.798 align:start position:0%
representative of the site and its
 
06:22:57.310 --> 06:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
ability to move water so I just raised
 
06:22:58.750 --> 06:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
that I think that's again a technical
 
06:23:01.590 --> 06:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
issue where I think perhaps that Max
 
06:23:03.270 --> 06:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
that term the use of the term maximum
 
06:23:04.990 --> 06:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
cage velocity probably needs to be
 
06:23:07.350 --> 06:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
looked at in terms of a clearer
 
06:23:10.030 --> 06:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
definition um and another technical
 
06:23:14.310 --> 06:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
issue on page uh um I think it's the
 
06:23:14.320 --> 06:23:17.150 align:start position:0%
issue on page uh um I think it's the
page

06:23:17.150 --> 06:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
page
 
06:23:19.670 --> 06:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
um would be page
 
06:23:23.750 --> 06:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
two lines uh 16 through
 
06:23:27.830 --> 06:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
18 um it uses the term fully permitted
 
06:23:30.350 --> 06:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
and this is a again a technical issue
 
06:23:32.468 --> 06:23:32.478 align:start position:0%
because it's basically saying that
 
06:23:34.910 --> 06:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
expansions are or landfills are fully
 
06:23:38.150 --> 06:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
permitted or exempt and the way that we
 
06:23:39.628 --> 06:23:39.638 align:start position:0%
as I've said to this committee many
 
06:23:41.670 --> 06:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
times we administer the solid waste
 
06:23:44.030 --> 06:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
program and particular our landfill
 
06:23:45.910 --> 06:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory program through a system of
 
06:23:47.788 --> 06:23:47.798 align:start position:0%
permits and we're all you know virtually
 
06:23:49.628 --> 06:23:49.638 align:start position:0%
any change you make or any new
 
06:23:51.390 --> 06:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
advancement at a landfill there's a new
 
06:23:53.990 --> 06:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
permit modification that needs to happen
 
06:23:57.390 --> 06:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
so it could be read that if if the
 
06:23:59.708 --> 06:23:59.718 align:start position:0%
desire of the bill is to expand those
 
06:24:02.390 --> 06:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
facilities a an expansion that's been
 
06:24:04.670 --> 06:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
approved at a landfill is not really
 
06:24:06.708 --> 06:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
fully permitted until it's approved for
 
06:24:08.910 --> 06:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
construction and it's given operational
 
06:24:10.750 --> 06:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
approval and that happens very late in
 
06:24:13.350 --> 06:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
the game so I think it's just again a
 
06:24:14.910 --> 06:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
language thing that maybe should be
 
06:24:16.110 --> 06:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
should be looked
 
06:24:20.468 --> 06:24:20.478 align:start position:0%
at um also on page two line
 
06:24:25.750 --> 06:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
19 um uses the term the phrase perennial
 
06:24:28.510 --> 06:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
water bodies traversing a footprint and
 
06:24:30.430 --> 06:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me under what
 
06:24:32.830 --> 06:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances that would occur this
 
06:24:34.590 --> 06:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
suggests that there's a perennial water
 
06:24:36.910 --> 06:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
body within the footprint of the
 
06:24:39.750 --> 06:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
landfill uh and then talks about
 
06:24:41.430 --> 06:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
monitoring that would be required for
 
06:24:44.070 --> 06:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
that and um not clear that any that
 
06:24:45.708 --> 06:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
circumstance would ever get a permit so
 
06:24:47.910 --> 06:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure it make it just
 
06:24:49.310 --> 06:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
makes me think maybe I don't understand
 
06:24:50.708 --> 06:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
what it's trying to accomplish so I
 
06:24:57.788 --> 06:24:57.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise it um and then uh on uh
 
06:25:01.830 --> 06:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
page two line 24 and going on it
 
06:25:06.628 --> 06:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:08.510 --> 06:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
oh again it describes the conduct of
 
06:25:08.520 --> 06:25:09.910 align:start position:0%
oh again it describes the conduct of
subsurface

06:25:09.910 --> 06:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
subsurface
 
06:25:11.990 --> 06:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
investigations um that that look at
 
06:25:14.510 --> 06:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
surficial stratigraphy in Bedrock and
 
06:25:16.430 --> 06:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
then it makes the uses the phrase at
 
06:25:19.190 --> 06:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
least to a depth of nearby aquafers used
 
06:25:20.910 --> 06:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
and that goes back to my comment before
 
06:25:23.390 --> 06:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
about really defining aquafer I think
 
06:25:25.270 --> 06:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
the meaning here is that there's an
 
06:25:27.510 --> 06:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
offside aquifer that is nearby that is
 
06:25:29.430 --> 06:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
used for drinking water but it isn't
 
06:25:31.708 --> 06:25:31.718 align:start position:0%
really clear for that it isn't that that
 
06:25:33.628 --> 06:25:33.638 align:start position:0%
isn't clear in the language so I think
 
06:25:35.190 --> 06:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
that's maybe a technical issue that
 
06:25:38.788 --> 06:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
should be should be should be looked at
 
06:25:41.230 --> 06:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
um and then on and the sponsor has
 
06:25:42.670 --> 06:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
acknowledged this but I just do want to
 
06:25:44.548 --> 06:25:44.558 align:start position:0%
raise page two line
 
06:25:48.830 --> 06:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
35 um to page three of line three uh it
 
06:25:51.510 --> 06:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
excludes from consideration any sites
 
06:25:53.270 --> 06:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
that are located within 10 miles of a
 
06:25:56.350 --> 06:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
Superfund Site or 10 miles of another
 
06:25:59.510 --> 06:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
landfill and I'm not really sure why
 
06:26:03.070 --> 06:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
that is relevant um but even if it is it
 
06:26:04.670 --> 06:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
be important to consider what that might
 
06:26:07.548 --> 06:26:07.558 align:start position:0%
mean we have 22 super fund sites in New
 
06:26:10.110 --> 06:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and a number of landfills
 
06:26:12.030 --> 06:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
including if you talking about online
 
06:26:15.070 --> 06:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
landfills or 300 of those if you drew a
 
06:26:17.628 --> 06:26:17.638 align:start position:0%
10 mile radius around every one of those
 
06:26:19.548 --> 06:26:19.558 align:start position:0%
facilities I'm not sure any of the state
 
06:26:22.190 --> 06:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
would be left so I want to just raise
 
06:26:23.548 --> 06:26:23.558 align:start position:0%
that as a
 
06:26:28.948 --> 06:26:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:31.628 --> 06:26:31.638 align:start position:0%
um I guess two other issues that I think
 
06:26:33.628 --> 06:26:33.638 align:start position:0%
the sponsor has acknowledged but I just
 
06:26:37.590 --> 06:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate on page uh page three
 
06:26:41.230 --> 06:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
15 lines 15 to 17 regarding the Ford act
 
06:26:43.430 --> 06:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
um we' this has been vetted thoroughly
 
06:26:45.390 --> 06:26:45.400 align:start position:0%
through the rulemaking process we're
 
06:26:48.070 --> 06:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
confident that our rules invoke that and
 
06:26:49.788 --> 06:26:49.798 align:start position:0%
that it's already it's a federal law it
 
06:26:52.310 --> 06:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
applies anyways and our rules were were
 
06:26:54.830 --> 06:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
amended to make it clear that the
 
06:26:57.868 --> 06:26:57.878 align:start position:0%
applicant of a for a landfill needs to
 
06:27:00.750 --> 06:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
notify the FAA of their application and
 
06:27:02.990 --> 06:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
get a determination from them whether
 
06:27:05.110 --> 06:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
there are any Ford Act applicable land
 
06:27:07.548 --> 06:27:07.558 align:start position:0%
airports within a certain radius so
 
06:27:08.708 --> 06:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
we're confident that that is
 
06:27:10.070 --> 06:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
appropriately addressed and I don't
 
06:27:13.150 --> 06:27:13.160 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary in this bill and
 
06:27:16.190 --> 06:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
then lastly um again the sponsor
 
06:27:20.150 --> 06:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
acknowledged um the page three lines 18
 
06:27:22.590 --> 06:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
to 30 which has a lot of language that
 
06:27:25.110 --> 06:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
would exclude um anybody who who's
 
06:27:27.110 --> 06:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
committed any kind of violation of a
 
06:27:29.590 --> 06:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
state law federal law local law permit
 
06:27:32.628 --> 06:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
regulation um from getting a permit and
 
06:27:34.548 --> 06:27:34.558 align:start position:0%
you know we we administer a compliance
 
06:27:37.110 --> 06:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
Assurance program we're never out there
 
06:27:38.390 --> 06:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
as much as we'd like to be but we're
 
06:27:40.788 --> 06:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
always trying to do more and so we try
 
06:27:42.390 --> 06:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
to get to our facilities and do a
 
06:27:44.468 --> 06:27:44.478 align:start position:0%
thorough inspection and there are a lot
 
06:27:46.070 --> 06:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
of requirements and there's always going
 
06:27:49.390 --> 06:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
to be violations and so if as this is
 
06:27:51.190 --> 06:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
written I don't think anybody that's
 
06:27:52.590 --> 06:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
ever operated a landfill in New
 
06:27:54.310 --> 06:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire even if they're doing a really
 
06:27:56.868 --> 06:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
good job could get a permit the way
 
06:27:58.150 --> 06:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's written so I know that the
 
06:28:00.190 --> 06:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
sponsors acknowledge a need to look at
 
06:28:02.310 --> 06:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
that and and I would uh I would Echo
 
06:28:04.948 --> 06:28:04.958 align:start position:0%
that and I'll uh I'll leave it at that
 
06:28:07.270 --> 06:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
and um answer any questions you might
 
06:28:10.670 --> 06:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
have representative ger thank you madam
 
06:28:12.190 --> 06:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
chair thank you director for taking my
 
06:28:14.390 --> 06:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
question uh and this is a question about
 
06:28:17.708 --> 06:28:17.718 align:start position:0%
aquafers uh which I don't pretend to
 
06:28:19.310 --> 06:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
understand in any great depth pun
 
06:28:22.788 --> 06:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
intended um last year no laugh for that
 
06:28:26.150 --> 06:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
at all okay thank you thank you U last
 
06:28:28.150 --> 06:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
year uh we passed a bill that went on to
 
06:28:29.750 --> 06:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
get signed by the governor it had to do
 
06:28:32.030 --> 06:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
with classifying landfills as projects
 
06:28:35.548 --> 06:28:35.558 align:start position:0%
of regional impact and part of that bill
 
06:28:37.830 --> 06:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
in my recollection had to do with it
 
06:28:40.670 --> 06:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
referred specifically to a table of
 
06:28:43.390 --> 06:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
identified aquafers because that was
 
06:28:45.708 --> 06:28:45.718 align:start position:0%
part of that legislation so my question
 
06:28:50.708 --> 06:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
is uh do we not have a uh a kind of a
 
06:28:52.110 --> 06:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
mapped out system because I'm trying to
 
06:28:53.310 --> 06:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
remember what we referred to in that
 
06:28:55.830 --> 06:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
bill it was watersheds watersheds I'm
 
06:28:57.510 --> 06:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you very much Madam chair
 
06:29:00.190 --> 06:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
that's what I was trying desperately to
 
06:29:02.350 --> 06:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
remember thank
 
06:29:04.830 --> 06:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
you representative B
 
06:29:07.990 --> 06:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
so um it sounds like uh and and I the
 
06:29:10.190 --> 06:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
prime sponsored acknowledged this there
 
06:29:11.548 --> 06:29:11.558 align:start position:0%
is a certain amount of work to be done
 
06:29:15.150 --> 06:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
on the bill uh and I don't think that I
 
06:29:18.350 --> 06:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
think you've done a good job of Iden
 
06:29:24.110 --> 06:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
identifying um uh items of concern uh I
 
06:29:25.868 --> 06:29:25.878 align:start position:0%
don't think that we could get very far
 
06:29:29.190 --> 06:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
by trying to like figure out the answers
 
06:29:30.990 --> 06:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
to all of those right here and now but
 
06:29:33.270 --> 06:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
would you be available to work with the
 
06:29:36.708 --> 06:29:36.718 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to uh to put together an
 
06:29:38.510 --> 06:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
amendment for this or advise on an
 
06:29:40.868 --> 06:29:40.878 align:start position:0%
amendment we certainly uh assist the
 
06:29:42.390 --> 06:29:42.400 align:start position:0%

06:29:45.030 --> 06:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
be helpful thank you thank you any other

perhaps deficiencies or points where we
 
06:30:04.830 --> 06:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
need refinement in this uh in this
 
06:30:04.840 --> 06:30:06.190 align:start position:0%
need refinement in this uh in this
important

06:30:06.190 --> 06:30:06.200 align:start position:0%

hb77 and I would just like to say that
 
06:30:24.350 --> 06:30:24.360 align:start position:0%

legislation on the blue sheet and one
 
06:30:45.160 --> 06:30:48.548 align:start position:0%

06:30:55.070 --> 06:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
close out the hearing for
 
06:30:57.510 --> 06:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
hb77 I want to thank everybody who's
 
06:30:59.750 --> 06:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
come today to speak on this
 
06:31:04.948 --> 06:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
bill and I know we are running late uh
 
06:31:08.910 --> 06:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
but we still have one before us which is
 
06:31:12.670 --> 06:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
house resolution 10 uh we're running a
 
06:31:14.430 --> 06:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
half hour late I hope that we can get
 
06:31:17.070 --> 06:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
through this fairly quickly at the
 
06:31:22.150 --> 06:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:25.750 --> 06:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
hr10 um but this is a house resolution
 
06:31:27.868 --> 06:31:27.878 align:start position:0%
recognizing the fundamental right to
 
06:31:30.590 --> 06:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
have clean air clean water and a healthy
 
06:31:30.600 --> 06:31:34.230 align:start position:0%
have clean air clean water and a healthy
environment

06:31:34.230 --> 06:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:38.590 --> 06:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
so I believe the sponsor of that bill is
 
06:31:38.600 --> 06:31:49.310 align:start position:0%
so I believe the sponsor of that bill is
representative

06:31:49.310 --> 06:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:49.320 --> 06:31:52.230 align:start position:0%
 
gerana

06:31:52.230 --> 06:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
gerana
 
06:31:52.240 --> 06:31:53.788 align:start position:0%
gerana
and

06:31:53.788 --> 06:31:53.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:31:57.270 --> 06:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
um we all settle down
 
06:32:00.310 --> 06:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
here please proceed thank you so much
 
06:32:01.750 --> 06:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I promise this
 
06:32:04.388 --> 06:32:04.398 align:start position:0%
will be quick uh for the record my name
 
06:32:08.270 --> 06:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
is Nick Jana I am I represent chesher 15
 
06:32:11.708 --> 06:32:11.718 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale Chesterfield Kean Wards 1 and 3
 
06:32:14.628 --> 06:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
through five Siri Walpole and
 
06:32:18.270 --> 06:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
westerland uh unlike you know we had a
 
06:32:19.430 --> 06:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier this morning
 
06:32:21.670 --> 06:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
regarding uh house resolutions and and
 
06:32:23.430 --> 06:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
how meaningful they are also some
 
06:32:25.868 --> 06:32:25.878 align:start position:0%
discussion of the length of resolution
 
06:32:28.468 --> 06:32:28.478 align:start position:0%
so I I hope my committee colleagues uh
 
06:32:30.670 --> 06:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
will recognize the fact that this is an
 
06:32:33.868 --> 06:32:33.878 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily short uh resolution
 
06:32:36.948 --> 06:32:36.958 align:start position:0%
there are three very brief whereases so
 
06:32:38.590 --> 06:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully that will be a selling point
 
06:32:40.510 --> 06:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
for for some of my friends on the
 
06:32:43.388 --> 06:32:43.398 align:start position:0%
committee uh very quickly in terms of
 
06:32:45.750 --> 06:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
the reason why the motivation behind the
 
06:32:48.830 --> 06:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
bill I am also not generally a big fan
 
06:32:51.868 --> 06:32:51.878 align:start position:0%
of of house resolutions uh but as uh
 
06:32:54.510 --> 06:32:54.520 align:start position:0%
some will recall last year there was a
 
06:32:56.590 --> 06:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
proposed constitutional amendment to
 
06:32:57.868 --> 06:32:57.878 align:start position:0%
this effect that was brought to this
 
06:32:59.910 --> 06:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
committee and we had some good
 
06:33:01.948 --> 06:33:01.958 align:start position:0%
discussion uh and some of my colleagues
 
06:33:04.948 --> 06:33:04.958 align:start position:0%
on this committee and then on the house
 
06:33:07.230 --> 06:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
uh said that they were entirely in
 
06:33:09.830 --> 06:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
support of the spirit of the bill uh of
 
06:33:11.270 --> 06:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional Amendment they were
 
06:33:12.948 --> 06:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
just concerned about what were its
 
06:33:15.350 --> 06:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
implications what are its ramifications
 
06:33:17.070 --> 06:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
will there be lawsuits what does this
 
06:33:19.430 --> 06:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
mean in terms of practical uh
 
06:33:21.310 --> 06:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
application uh and so what I have
 
06:33:22.868 --> 06:33:22.878 align:start position:0%
brought you today in the form of a house
 
06:33:24.910 --> 06:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
resolution is a statement about
 
06:33:27.030 --> 06:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
regarding the fundamental right to a
 
06:33:29.150 --> 06:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
clean and healthy environment that has
 
06:33:31.830 --> 06:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
no practical application whatsoever
 
06:33:34.430 --> 06:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
right so I hope that my my colleagues
 
06:33:37.670 --> 06:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
who last year said they supported the
 
06:33:40.110 --> 06:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
spirit of the bill but were concerned
 
06:33:41.788 --> 06:33:41.798 align:start position:0%
because of possible implications will
 
06:33:44.910 --> 06:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
not now argue that they can't support it
 
06:33:48.548 --> 06:33:48.558 align:start position:0%
when it has no practical
 
06:33:52.628 --> 06:33:52.638 align:start position:0%
implications the logic of the bill is
 
06:33:54.788 --> 06:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
that the right to a clean and healthy
 
06:33:56.948 --> 06:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
environment is a fundamental right and I
 
06:33:59.110 --> 06:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
would argue the most fundamental right
 
06:34:01.270 --> 06:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
we articulate in our our United States
 
06:34:02.750 --> 06:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution and in our state
 
06:34:04.948 --> 06:34:04.958 align:start position:0%
constitution a series of fundamental
 
06:34:06.548 --> 06:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
rights freedom of speech freedom of
 
06:34:10.110 --> 06:34:10.120 align:start position:0%
religion the right to bear arms uh Etc
 
06:34:11.868 --> 06:34:11.878 align:start position:0%
uh but my argument is that the right to
 
06:34:13.788 --> 06:34:13.798 align:start position:0%
a clean and healthy environment is
 
06:34:16.070 --> 06:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
actually the fundamental right uh our
 
06:34:19.070 --> 06:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
ability to enjoy our other rights our
 
06:34:22.190 --> 06:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
ability to exercise our other rights uh
 
06:34:24.830 --> 06:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
is really grounded in the notion that we
 
06:34:26.830 --> 06:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
have a clean and healthy and safe place
 
06:34:30.548 --> 06:34:30.558 align:start position:0%
to do those things um so in that sense
 
06:34:32.788 --> 06:34:32.798 align:start position:0%
as you can see in the short whereas
 
06:34:34.230 --> 06:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
section of the bill
 
06:34:36.750 --> 06:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
uh this bill contends that uh our
 
06:34:39.030 --> 06:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
ability to enjoy our other already
 
06:34:40.708 --> 06:34:40.718 align:start position:0%
recognized fundamental rights is
 
06:34:42.670 --> 06:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
contingent upon our ability to enjoy
 
06:34:45.510 --> 06:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
this one uh and I just want to
 
06:34:48.750 --> 06:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
close uh by saying that fundamental
 
06:34:52.110 --> 06:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
rights have to be declared even if it's
 
06:34:54.468 --> 06:34:54.478 align:start position:0%
in a document like this that doesn't
 
06:34:56.270 --> 06:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily not necessarily doesn't have
 
06:34:58.830 --> 06:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
any uh legal impact and they have to be
 
06:35:01.150 --> 06:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
declared uh this one has to be declared
 
06:35:02.948 --> 06:35:02.958 align:start position:0%
because we decided we're not going in
 
06:35:04.590 --> 06:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
the direction of Constitutional
 
06:35:07.230 --> 06:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment but we should at least be able
 
06:35:09.868 --> 06:35:09.878 align:start position:0%
to do this in the form of a resolution
 
06:35:12.868 --> 06:35:12.878 align:start position:0%
we should at least be able to say
 
06:35:15.430 --> 06:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
officially that we recognize this as a
 
06:35:17.628 --> 06:35:17.638 align:start position:0%
fundamental right it is literally the
 
06:35:20.310 --> 06:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
least we can do uh and
 
06:35:23.150 --> 06:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
that is all I have in terms of my
 
06:35:24.750 --> 06:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
introduction I'm happy to answer any
 
06:35:27.150 --> 06:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
questions representa
 
06:35:29.350 --> 06:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you madam chair and thank
 
06:35:30.788 --> 06:35:30.798 align:start position:0%
you representative gerana for bringing
 
06:35:33.030 --> 06:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
this forward and apologies if I've
 
06:35:34.830 --> 06:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
grimaced at anyone I have contacts that
 
06:35:36.628 --> 06:35:36.638 align:start position:0%
are getting real dry I shouldn't have
 
06:35:38.310 --> 06:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
warned them when reading today if I
 
06:35:40.388 --> 06:35:40.398 align:start position:0%
Grimace at you it's not cuz I it's just
 
06:35:43.190 --> 06:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
cuz I'm trying to see you um I really
 
06:35:45.270 --> 06:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate you bringing forward this
 
06:35:48.270 --> 06:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
resolution and I'm wondering do you view
 
06:35:51.548 --> 06:35:51.558 align:start position:0%
this as comparable to uh in the New
 
06:35:53.388 --> 06:35:53.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution how we outline
 
06:35:55.788 --> 06:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
that a right to a good education is is a
 
06:35:58.708 --> 06:35:58.718 align:start position:0%
part to uh the fundamental nature of
 
06:36:00.990 --> 06:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
society such as you know do you view it
 
06:36:03.190 --> 06:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
as comparable meeting this is a clean
 
06:36:05.548 --> 06:36:05.558 align:start position:0%
healthy environment fundamental to our
 
06:36:06.910 --> 06:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
society and New Hampshire's already
 
06:36:08.868 --> 06:36:08.878 align:start position:0%
recognized some of those fundamental
 
06:36:11.230 --> 06:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
rights within its Constitution and I
 
06:36:14.868 --> 06:36:14.878 align:start position:0%
would you believe that this is a a good
 
06:36:17.270 --> 06:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
jump off of where the Constitution is
 
06:36:19.708 --> 06:36:19.718 align:start position:0%
currently thank you representative uh I
 
06:36:20.910 --> 06:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
certainly would believe that right the
 
06:36:23.230 --> 06:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution says that in order to
 
06:36:25.150 --> 06:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
exercise our rights as Citizens and to
 
06:36:27.150 --> 06:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
perform our duty as Citizens the state
 
06:36:28.990 --> 06:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
has a requirement to support education
 
06:36:31.670 --> 06:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
in this state and I see this as being a
 
06:36:34.510 --> 06:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
foundational right in that same sense so
 
06:36:34.520 --> 06:36:36.868 align:start position:0%
foundational right in that same sense so
thank

06:36:36.868 --> 06:36:36.878 align:start position:0%

um no no questions no told you it' be
 
06:36:53.070 --> 06:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
quick well I mean I I I guess I do have
 
06:36:56.670 --> 06:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
a question as in so far as the
 
06:36:58.628 --> 06:36:58.638 align:start position:0%
definition of a
 
06:36:58.638 --> 06:37:00.468 align:start position:0%
definition of a
right

06:37:00.468 --> 06:37:00.478 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:37:04.070 --> 06:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
um I mean you know we we we kind of
 
06:37:06.708 --> 06:37:06.718 align:start position:0%
throw that around that you know I have a
 
06:37:10.948 --> 06:37:10.958 align:start position:0%
right to housing I have a right to food
 
06:37:13.468 --> 06:37:13.478 align:start position:0%
you know I have a right to
 
06:37:17.430 --> 06:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
whatever um and and I and I get
 
06:37:19.150 --> 06:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
that I
 
06:37:23.430 --> 06:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
think um my question to you
 
06:37:28.310 --> 06:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
is how do you view this as a
 
06:37:30.350 --> 06:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much uh Madam
 
06:37:31.388 --> 06:37:31.398 align:start position:0%
chairman that's a great question I'm
 
06:37:32.788 --> 06:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
going to trying to think about how to
 
06:37:34.670 --> 06:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
make this decision because as a
 
06:37:36.510 --> 06:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
historian of ideas I would be happy to
 
06:37:39.388 --> 06:37:39.398 align:start position:0%
talk at length about the history of the
 
06:37:41.190 --> 06:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
debate about what right is but I will
 
06:37:43.750 --> 06:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know we but but we do take this
 
06:37:45.708 --> 06:37:45.718 align:start position:0%
seriously in so far as you know we talk
 
06:37:48.310 --> 06:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
about constitutional rights the right to
 
06:37:50.868 --> 06:37:50.878 align:start position:0%
life liberty The Pursuit of Happiness
 
06:37:55.510 --> 06:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
yes um and natural rights but um there
 
06:37:57.468 --> 06:37:57.478 align:start position:0%
are certain things I believe that you
 
06:37:59.388 --> 06:37:59.398 align:start position:0%
can guarantee in life and some things
 
06:38:03.590 --> 06:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
that you cannot guarantee in life um so
 
06:38:05.628 --> 06:38:05.638 align:start position:0%
I just want to know where where you are
 
06:38:08.590 --> 06:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
what your um what your definition or
 
06:38:10.910 --> 06:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
perception is of a right thank you
 
06:38:12.150 --> 06:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
though I think that's a fabulous
 
06:38:13.830 --> 06:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
question and I would say it's something
 
06:38:16.070 --> 06:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
which is essential to the Dignity of
 
06:38:18.270 --> 06:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
personhood right that when we Define our
 
06:38:20.150 --> 06:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
rights in terms of the right to speech
 
06:38:21.670 --> 06:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
and the right to practice our religion
 
06:38:23.388 --> 06:38:23.398 align:start position:0%
and the right to defend ourselves and
 
06:38:25.510 --> 06:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
and our property and our family these
 
06:38:27.230 --> 06:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
are rights which are and that's why I
 
06:38:29.070 --> 06:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
mean of course the phrase we all know is
 
06:38:31.948 --> 06:38:31.958 align:start position:0%
in inali inalienable or unalienable
 
06:38:34.548 --> 06:38:34.558 align:start position:0%
right and and by that Jefferson meant a
 
06:38:37.590 --> 06:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
right which Belongs To You by The Very
 
06:38:40.270 --> 06:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
essential nature of the dignity that you
 
06:38:43.150 --> 06:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
hold as a human being um and and I see
 
06:38:45.110 --> 06:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
this as a right in that respect your
 
06:38:49.750 --> 06:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
ability to as I said live to pursue
 
06:38:52.270 --> 06:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
happiness to take care of your family
 
06:38:54.990 --> 06:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
etc etc depends on your ability to live
 
06:38:57.150 --> 06:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
in an environment which is guaranteed at
 
06:39:00.990 --> 06:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
least some measure of safety we we have
 
06:39:02.830 --> 06:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
all kinds of laws to guarantee our
 
06:39:05.990 --> 06:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
personal safety in terms of uh being uh
 
06:39:08.310 --> 06:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
impacted by other people but safety is
 
06:39:10.788 --> 06:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
also about our ability to live in an
 
06:39:12.670 --> 06:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
environment that is also not posing a
 
06:39:15.150 --> 06:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
danger to our essential dignity as a
 
06:39:17.628 --> 06:39:17.638 align:start position:0%
human being so uh I don't know if that
 
06:39:20.830 --> 06:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
helps but uh to me uh the question
 
06:39:23.590 --> 06:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately is to what are we entitled by
 
06:39:26.310 --> 06:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
the very nature of our personhood and if
 
06:39:27.830 --> 06:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
these other rights that we speak of
 
06:39:29.948 --> 06:39:29.958 align:start position:0%
religion and the right to bear arms and
 
06:39:31.510 --> 06:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
and the freedom of speech are essential
 
06:39:33.388 --> 06:39:33.398 align:start position:0%
which I believe they are I believe this
 
06:39:36.430 --> 06:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
is just as essential to our ability to
 
06:39:38.830 --> 06:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh you to recognize the fundamental
 
06:39:40.830 --> 06:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
Dignity of each of our
 
06:39:43.750 --> 06:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
personhoods okay representative King
 
06:39:45.110 --> 06:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
06:39:47.548 --> 06:39:47.558 align:start position:0%
taking questions are you familiar with
 
06:39:50.670 --> 06:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
the differences in definitions of
 
06:39:53.190 --> 06:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
positive and negative rights and the
 
06:39:56.030 --> 06:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
differences between the two and if so do
 
06:39:58.830 --> 06:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
you view the rights delineated in this
 
06:40:00.990 --> 06:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
house resolution as positive or negative
 
06:40:03.030 --> 06:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
rights thank you that's a great question
 
06:40:04.990 --> 06:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
so it's like do you have the freedom to
 
06:40:06.910 --> 06:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
or do you have the freedom from right is
 
06:40:09.190 --> 06:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
the essence of a a positive right is the
 
06:40:11.270 --> 06:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
right to do something a negative right
 
06:40:13.548 --> 06:40:13.558 align:start position:0%
is the right not to be infringed by
 
06:40:17.628 --> 06:40:17.638 align:start position:0%
something right um and the right has to
 
06:40:18.948 --> 06:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
actually when we think about the freedom
 
06:40:21.910 --> 06:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
of religion it contains both right you
 
06:40:24.230 --> 06:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
have the right to practice your religion
 
06:40:26.430 --> 06:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
but you also have the freedom from
 
06:40:29.468 --> 06:40:29.478 align:start position:0%
infringement upon that right right so it
 
06:40:31.388 --> 06:40:31.398 align:start position:0%
is in a sense both a positive and a
 
06:40:32.990 --> 06:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
negative right and the essence of a
 
06:40:35.910 --> 06:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
right in our system in our system of
 
06:40:38.590 --> 06:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
liberal Western democracy is that my
 
06:40:40.430 --> 06:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
rights end at the bridge of your nose
 
06:40:43.990 --> 06:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
right so my positive right goes to the
 
06:40:46.670 --> 06:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
point where it infringes upon the right
 
06:40:49.708 --> 06:40:49.718 align:start position:0%
of another individual right so in this
 
06:40:52.510 --> 06:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
case I think that it is both uh it is
 
06:40:54.388 --> 06:40:54.398 align:start position:0%
fundamentally a negative right in the
 
06:40:57.388 --> 06:40:57.398 align:start position:0%
sense that it is a sense of safety in
 
06:40:58.708 --> 06:40:58.718 align:start position:0%
the same way that your right to defend
 
06:41:02.468 --> 06:41:02.478 align:start position:0%
yourself is a sense of safety um the
 
06:41:04.628 --> 06:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
question I think where we got into the
 
06:41:05.948 --> 06:41:05.958 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment this is all
 
06:41:07.150 --> 06:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
getting into the weeds but when we were
 
06:41:08.190 --> 06:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
talking about the Constitutional
 
06:41:10.270 --> 06:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
amendment I think the question was well
 
06:41:11.590 --> 06:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
what would it mean if you asserted this
 
06:41:14.070 --> 06:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
as a positive right right what are you
 
06:41:16.868 --> 06:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
entitled to what legal actions are you
 
06:41:19.070 --> 06:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
entitled to pursue that would be the
 
06:41:21.110 --> 06:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
question of if this were applied as a
 
06:41:22.910 --> 06:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
positive right but the negative right I
 
06:41:25.548 --> 06:41:25.558 align:start position:0%
think here that is a defense from
 
06:41:28.150 --> 06:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
infringement of your personal freedoms I
 
06:41:29.750 --> 06:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
would compare here to our freedom to
 
06:41:29.760 --> 06:41:30.948 align:start position:0%
would compare here to our freedom to
defend

06:41:30.948 --> 06:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
defend
 
06:41:32.708 --> 06:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
ourselves thank you very much I
 
06:41:35.190 --> 06:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate that answer representative
 
06:41:38.670 --> 06:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
coma thank you madam chair and thank you
 
06:41:43.990 --> 06:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative so my question is is what
 
06:41:46.788 --> 06:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
does clean and healthy mean who defines
 
06:41:48.948 --> 06:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
that and who
 
06:41:48.958 --> 06:41:51.230 align:start position:0%
that and who
determines

06:41:51.230 --> 06:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
determines
 
06:41:53.270 --> 06:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
that I think that's an excellent
 
06:41:55.990 --> 06:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
question and that is a reason why people
 
06:41:57.830 --> 06:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
voted against uh this is a
 
06:41:59.548 --> 06:41:59.558 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment I'm not sure
 
06:42:00.948 --> 06:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
that we need to split those hairs when
 
06:42:02.590 --> 06:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a house resolution
 
06:42:03.868 --> 06:42:03.878 align:start position:0%
and I don't mean to be flipping I
 
06:42:06.230 --> 06:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
literally just mean offering it as a
 
06:42:07.910 --> 06:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
house resolution as opposed to say a
 
06:42:10.150 --> 06:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
bill or a constitutional amendment I
 
06:42:12.548 --> 06:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
don't think requires us to get into that
 
06:42:14.750 --> 06:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
granular level of detail to Define what
 
06:42:18.310 --> 06:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:20.548 --> 06:42:20.558 align:start position:0%
applied representative
 
06:42:23.910 --> 06:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
Howard couldn't we just um let everybody
 
06:42:25.948 --> 06:42:25.958 align:start position:0%
sort of run with their own idea of clean
 
06:42:29.468 --> 06:42:29.478 align:start position:0%
and and pure and you know healthy
 
06:42:31.388 --> 06:42:31.398 align:start position:0%
environment right we might all have a
 
06:42:34.270 --> 06:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
different idea but we can all believe in
 
06:42:36.548 --> 06:42:36.558 align:start position:0%
that yes and I would say we've been
 
06:42:39.070 --> 06:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
arguing for almost 250 years about what
 
06:42:41.948 --> 06:42:41.958 align:start position:0%
the right to bear arms is right so there
 
06:42:44.670 --> 06:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
isn't one answer to that question the
 
06:42:46.110 --> 06:42:46.120 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech we have all kinds of
 
06:42:48.070 --> 06:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
limitations on the freedom of speech
 
06:42:49.830 --> 06:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
freedom of religion is Up For Debate in
 
06:42:51.430 --> 06:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
terms of positive and negative rights
 
06:42:53.030 --> 06:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
right so I would say any of our
 
06:42:55.110 --> 06:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights uh and and
 
06:42:56.948 --> 06:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
representative comp was I don't
 
06:42:58.350 --> 06:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
literally didn't mean to be dismissive
 
06:43:00.750 --> 06:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
of your question it's a question that is
 
06:43:03.590 --> 06:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
true of all of our fundamental rights
 
06:43:05.388 --> 06:43:05.398 align:start position:0%
how do you define them where do you draw
 
06:43:08.590 --> 06:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
the lines absolutely so I think that
 
06:43:11.708 --> 06:43:11.718 align:start position:0%
there is enough common agreement on what
 
06:43:14.110 --> 06:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
this means that for a house resolution a
 
06:43:15.788 --> 06:43:15.798 align:start position:0%
statement by the house if we were
 
06:43:17.750 --> 06:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
looking at a bill or Constitutional
 
06:43:19.990 --> 06:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment right then we would be asking
 
06:43:22.708 --> 06:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
a separate set of questions I
 
06:43:25.990 --> 06:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
think representative gr guber thank you
 
06:43:29.230 --> 06:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair um uh thank you for drafting
 
06:43:33.430 --> 06:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
this too um it seems to me that these
 
06:43:35.708 --> 06:43:35.718 align:start position:0%
words can ever be fully defined
 
06:43:36.948 --> 06:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
particularly in this case it doesn't
 
06:43:38.868 --> 06:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
matter you know to that degree but it
 
06:43:42.030 --> 06:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
does recognize our social values that we
 
06:43:45.628 --> 06:43:45.638 align:start position:0%
actually value clean air clean you know
 
06:43:47.750 --> 06:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
water healthy environment and that we're
 
06:43:49.948 --> 06:43:49.958 align:start position:0%
making a statement that we value this
 
06:43:51.948 --> 06:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
and that it's valuable for everybody so
 
06:43:53.510 --> 06:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
and since it doesn't have the force of
 
06:43:55.548 --> 06:43:55.558 align:start position:0%
law at least we're making a value
 
06:43:58.150 --> 06:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
judgment which is I think important
 
06:44:00.868 --> 06:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
thank you yes thank you I'm glad you did
 
06:44:02.708 --> 06:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
a very nice job of getting right to the
 
06:44:05.110 --> 06:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
point is a value statement uh in the end
 
06:44:06.350 --> 06:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
and I'd also say in terms of this
 
06:44:09.110 --> 06:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
question of how do we Define it uh I
 
06:44:11.070 --> 06:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
have a granddaughter who's now about
 
06:44:13.070 --> 06:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
five months old the newest member of our
 
06:44:15.350 --> 06:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
family uh and if you think about your
 
06:44:16.948 --> 06:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
loved ones your children your
 
06:44:18.990 --> 06:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
grandchildren you
 
06:44:21.468 --> 06:44:21.478 align:start position:0%
know what it means to want a clean and
 
06:44:24.388 --> 06:44:24.398 align:start position:0%
healthy environment for them right and
 
06:44:26.548 --> 06:44:26.558 align:start position:0%
again are do we need to Define that no
 
06:44:28.430 --> 06:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of a resolution
 
06:44:30.270 --> 06:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
it's a value statement and I think in
 
06:44:32.510 --> 06:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
the end we have a lot more consensus
 
06:44:35.548 --> 06:44:35.558 align:start position:0%
about what it means me then we would
 
06:44:37.868 --> 06:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
disagreement any other questions from
 
06:44:41.510 --> 06:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none I'd like the
 
06:44:44.910 --> 06:44:44.920 align:start position:0%

06:44:49.388 --> 06:44:49.398 align:start position:0%

hr10 and with that I'm going to end the
 
06:45:24.230 --> 06:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:24.240 --> 06:45:26.590 align:start position:0%
