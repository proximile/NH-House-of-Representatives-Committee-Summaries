00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
interesting tidbit about finance when i
 
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.110 align:start position:0%
interesting tidbit about finance when i
was

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
in gosh i think it was second and third
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
grade i used to attend appropriation
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
meetings with my mother my mother was
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
administrative assistants to what was
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
then called the warden of the state
 
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.189 align:start position:0%
then called the warden of the state
prison

00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
prison
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
but he actually ran the corrections
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
department and he used to come and
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
present the budget
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
um actually my mother presented the
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
budget she answered all the questions
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
and i remember at night when we'd go
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
home she spoke about the
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
appropriations committee a little
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
differently than she did when she
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
appeared before them during the day
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
so i had that perspective when i was
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
growing up about
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
how some of the members of the
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
appropriations committee
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
dealt with the employees so that i guess
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
gave me a good training of
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
how to deal with people that came and
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
appeared before the committee
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
because i remembered how some of them
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
dealt with my mom
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
and that was good training i think
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
um i have lived in concord my entire
 
00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:24.629 align:start position:0%
um i have lived in concord my entire
life

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
and went to schools here i have served
 
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:27.829 align:start position:0%
and went to schools here i have served
as

00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
a prosecutor most of my adult life was
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
female prosecutor of county attorney for
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
merrimack county
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
and have served as a police prosecutor
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
so my background is in criminal justice
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
i have probably my greatest interest in
 
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.829 align:start position:0%
i have probably my greatest interest in
division

00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
is the children and youth part of it
 
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.110 align:start position:0%
is the children and youth part of it
especially

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
um a great deal of interest in ydc
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
and with what happens with sununu and
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
the amount of money we're spending there
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
and what we're getting out of it
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
and um i think we'll all find a lot of
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
interest there i know representative
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
weiler knows the
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
complete sinkhole i guess is one word of
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
using of what we've dealt with there
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
um i also share with you representative
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
edwards a
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
great love of dogs and while i'm not a
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
college football fan i grew up with my
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
dad taking me
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
to the new england patriots or what was
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
in the boston patriots games
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
from when i was a child we would go to
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
the games
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
every year and i recently found um our
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
first tickets to the games he was a
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
season ticket holder
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
first year and the tickets were five
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
dollars a seat
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
now i still have inherited his season
 
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.310 align:start position:0%
now i still have inherited his season
tickets

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
and let's just say they're a little more
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
than five dollars a seat
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately but um i'm a huge
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
football fan
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
so we can share that as well when we
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
tend to disagree on a lot of other
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
things at least we have dogs in football
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
well i've been learning how to become a
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
patriots fan i found like
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.189 align:start position:0%
that it was uh essential to my new
career

00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%

uh unexpected but

funds
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
many of which cannot be earned without
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%

and as an auditor prior to that which is
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
why um as many of you know i sometimes
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
have strong feelings about revenues
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
and tax policy which i'm now allowed to
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
have a personal opinion on now that i no
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
longer work for the department
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%

beginning there'll be a little bit of
 
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.029 align:start position:0%
beginning there'll be a little bit of
overlap

00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
overlap
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%

even though we're not physically present
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
in the office
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
i am checking my voicemails so you can
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%

00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
provided representative edwards with my
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
shared that with the committee but
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%

00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:40.870 align:start position:0%
feel free to call me whenever you need
to

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
as we scroll down we just have a quick
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
look at the operating budget process
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
here uh
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
obviously we're in the governor's phase
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
the agency put out
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
its budget request back in october
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
and from november until the next couple
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
of weeks the governor is going to be
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
completing his
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
proposed budget and by law the governor
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
has to submit that to the legislature by
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
february 15th
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
although i think we've heard that he may
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
be presenting it a few days earlier this
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
year possibly on the 11th
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
and usually shortly after
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposed budget comes out
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks later his proposed
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
trailer bill will come out as well
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
and the committee will be hearing we'll
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
be holding a number of meetings on
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh that as well so the house phase
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
really begins in earnest
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
in mid-february after the governor has
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
presented his proposed budget and
 
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
the committee will be meeting likely
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
several times a week
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
between mid-february and late march
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
starting in mid-february usually right
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
away we'll have the agency come in
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
to talk about the various aspects of
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
their budget
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
and we can work out a calendar for that
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
a little later
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
at times uh the full finance committee
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
has heard presentations from each agency
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
or at least each of the major agencies
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
prior to the divisions beginning their
 
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.549 align:start position:0%
prior to the divisions beginning their
work

00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that's going to happen
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
this year or not but
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a possibility and then
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
finally after the house
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
finishes its work in late march we move
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
on to the senate
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
that continues on from april through
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
june and
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of june mid to the end of
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
june there'll be a committee of
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
conference phase
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh which will at which point we'll wrap
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
so moving on here we have a list of
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
helpful websites i won't visit all of
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
these but they're here for you to peruse
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
i will just bring you
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
quickly to our own website
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
if you go to the lba site and then under
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
budget division click
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
on budget and revenue documents that'll
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
bring you here so we have documents for
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
all of the operating and capital budgets
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
going back
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
to 2010. and if you look at the 2021
 
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.590 align:start position:0%
to 2010. and if you look at the 2021
page

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
you can see the type of information that
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
we tend to put up there we put up all
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
the major documents
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
for everybody to see members in the
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
public alike including
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
obviously house bills one and two as
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
they move through the process
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
the capital budget house bill 25 detail
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
change reports which are documents that
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
we produce
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
showing the changes from
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
the house finance budget to the
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
the senate budget to the house budget
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
etc so you can see what's happened in
 
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.350 align:start position:0%
etc so you can see what's happened in
each

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
we'll also post amendment packets here
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
when the full house finance committee
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
hears from the divisions they will see
 
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.510 align:start position:0%
hears from the divisions they will see
packets

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
packets
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
that contain proposed changes to house
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
bill 1 and house bill 2. we'll post that
 
00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.870 align:start position:0%
bill 1 and house bill 2. we'll post that
here

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
as well as compare reports surplus
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
statements etc so all the major
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
documents get posted here
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
because this year will be a little bit
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
different and
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
we'll be doing more work online and in a
 
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me um
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
we will also be setting up pages
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
specific to the divisions
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
they aren't online yet but we will have
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
a division three page and the idea
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
is to post their literally everything
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's distributed throughout the
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
division's work
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
so so everything that comes through the
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
division will ultimately be made
 
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.950 align:start position:0%
division will ultimately be made
available

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.909 align:start position:0%
available
online

00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
so scrolling down here the next couple
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
of pages
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
are basically different ways of looking
 
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.669 align:start position:0%
are basically different ways of looking
at

00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
the budget we have some tables we have
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
some pie charts but you can see here
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
that hhs
 
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
which makes up category 5 comprises
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
almost half of the state general fund
 
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.830 align:start position:0%
almost half of the state general fund
budget

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
and a little under 43 percent of the
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
total budget including
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
scrolling down again more ways of
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
and once again division three comprises
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
so i think at that point
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
i will take you down to the part of the
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
briefing that's specific to division
 
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:26.149 align:start position:0%
briefing that's specific to division
three

00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
which begins here on page
 
00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.430 align:start position:0%
which begins here on page
32

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
and here you can see broken out the
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
you can see the biggest component by far
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
we're looking at all funds here and the
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
office of medicaid services comprises
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
about 1.1
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
1.2 billion dollars in total funds out
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
of a 2.6
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
so scrolling down we get into some
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
specific program areas
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not necessarily going to go through
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
all of these in detail i think they're
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
they're they're here for you to read at
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
your leisure you don't necessarily have
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
to hear me
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
talk at you about them but i am going to
 
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
highlight some of the big areas
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
within the hhs budget and the first one
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
to talk about well i guess we'll gloss
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
over the child development program and
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
child protection and family services
 
00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:32.549 align:start position:0%
child protection and family services
first

00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
the child development program among
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
other things
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
funds child care scholarships for
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
families and provides assistance
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
with the cost of child care so they can
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
maintain employment
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
participate in training etc and you can
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
see here that their operating budget
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 20 was about 14.3 million
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
dollars in general funds
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
and 16 million in general funds in
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21.
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
for each of these items i've shown you
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
the general fund component for the 2021
 
00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:03.990 align:start position:0%
the general fund component for the 2021
budget

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
as well as the general fund component of
 
00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
the agency's
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
budget request for 2223 now obviously
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be the same as the
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
governor's budget but
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
for perspective you can see what the
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
moving down to child protection and
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
that contains roughly 62 to 68 million
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
in general funds per year in the current
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
2021 budget that budget
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
also added significant funding as did
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
the one before it
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
for a variety of positions specifically
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
child protective service workers
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
social workers licensed alcohol and drug
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
counselors who are contracted with the
 
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:47.669 align:start position:0%
counselors who are contracted with the
department

00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
attorneys nurses social worker services
 
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.190 align:start position:0%
attorneys nurses social worker services
etc

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
etc
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
that was in response to an independent
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
review of dcyf as well as a lot of
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
items that were in the news a while ago
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
about the caseload
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
specifically the the high load per case
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
worker within dcyf
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
so i believe that caseload has been
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
brought down a little bit the department
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
will be able to speak about and
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
speak about that in greater detail when
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
they appear before the committee in a
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
so moving down we have the sununu youth
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
services center uh this is always a
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
hot topic for division three and the
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
finance division generally
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
that's because when the sununu center
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
was constructed back in the early to mid
 
00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.590 align:start position:0%
was constructed back in the early to mid
2000s

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
2000s
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
it was constructed using partially state
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
funds partially federal funds
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
as a 144 bed facility
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
but over the past several years
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
specifically over the past four or five
 
00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.470 align:start position:0%
specifically over the past four or five
years

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
a couple of policy changes have resulted
 
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:47.750 align:start position:0%
a couple of policy changes have resulted
in

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh the daily census of the sununu center
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
dropping significantly
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh so rather than 144 beds being filled
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
i think as of the last dashboard that
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
the department put out
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
i believe there were 14
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
juveniles currently occupy currently
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
occupying the sununu center
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
and over the last couple of months it's
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
actually been as low as
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
nine occupying this new new center so
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's a very large facility for a very
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
low pop for very small population
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
there are four wings at the sununu
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
center i believe currently only two of
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
them are being used
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
so it's a large facility it has a large
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
maintenance budget that's generally
 
00:32:37.279 --> 00:32:37.830 align:start position:0%
maintenance budget that's generally
fixed

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
it has a staffing budget that to some
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
extent is also fixed for example they
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
need medical staff 24 hours a day
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of how many kids are there
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
so it'll be um
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
it'll probably be a hot topic going
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
forward there have been a number of
 
00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:53.750 align:start position:0%
forward there have been a number of
commissions

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
and a number of study committees that
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
have looked at
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
the issue of what to do with the sununu
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
center and how to fund it going forward
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
took place in 2017 2018
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
and i can find copies of all those
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
reports for you if you'd like to take a
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
look at them
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
but they recommended converting the
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
unused pods into either
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
a privately run substance use disorder
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
facility for juveniles
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
or a facility for pregnant teen and teen
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
and you may know that one of the unused
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
pods was previously used as a substance
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
use disorder facility for juveniles but
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
that i believe is no longer the case
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
so you can see there that the general
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
fund component of the sununu center's
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
budget was 10.6 million
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
in each year of the 2021 biennium and
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
that was deliberately designed to remain
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
flat with the budget in the 1819
 
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.870 align:start position:0%
flat with the budget in the 1819
biennium

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
the agency's request going forward is
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
about 14 million per year and 22 and 23.
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
and that does include some funding for
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
so i raised my hand there you probably
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
oh sorry i didn't see that
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
um okay so some of these
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
um physical locations when we get to
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
rona behind us
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
i would like to actually uh go see them
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
have they have they provided tours
 
00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.750 align:start position:0%
have they have they provided tours
before

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
they have they have and during the last
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
budget cycle we actually went over all
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
of division three went over and took a
 
00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:29.829 align:start position:0%
of division three went over and took a
tour

00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
tour
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
so yeah i think once covert is behind us
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
they should be
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
easily able to do that in the division
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
of human services is this
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
where the domestic violence fund is
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh domestic violence i believe is in
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
human services yes
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay because it's not mentioned here in
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
in your paragraph so i just wanted to
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh know where it was so it's in here
 
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.470 align:start position:0%
uh know where it was so it's in here
somewhere

00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh people have
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
raised their hand i may not have hit on
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
that in this um in this briefing
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
actually i didn't cover everything but i
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
can certainly provide information
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
uh going forward actually domestic
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
violence might be in um
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
i think about it that might be in uh
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder so
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
okay um and then as you're just
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
swinging by if you could point out where
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
new futures
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
and um wait not wayfair
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
what what's the name of that way
 
00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.910 align:start position:0%
what what's the name of that way
something

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:31.829 align:start position:0%
something
waypoint

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
where they were they fit in the budget
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
too okay sure that
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
that again would be in uh substance use
 
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
disorder services when we get there all
 
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.230 align:start position:0%
disorder services when we get there all
right

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren has her hand up
 
00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:48.390 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren has her hand up
to

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
um seems how jessa asked a question i
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
thought i could ask a question
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
um so when you're talking about house
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
bill one and two
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
you said house bill two was a trailer
 
00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.109 align:start position:0%
you said house bill two was a trailer
bill

00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
i think for the members that are new you
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
might define what that is
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
oh okay sure good point uh the trailer
 
00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.829 align:start position:0%
oh okay sure good point uh the trailer
bill

00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
the bill that basically effectuates
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
all of the changes in the budget that
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
aren't numbers so in other words if tax
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
rates change
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
those would have to be in the trailer
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
bill because the state supreme court
 
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.910 align:start position:0%
bill because the state supreme court
decided

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
decided
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
many years ago back in the 80s i believe
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
that the budget couldn't
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
change state law or state statute it
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
could only appropriate funds
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
so all the policy areas that pertain to
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
are contained in that trailer bill and
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's usually a very big
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
document it it varies by year but
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
um it's not uncommon for there to be
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
several hundred sections
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the trailer bill as it makes its way
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
through the process
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
and uh the fact that it's so big is the
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
reason it usually comes to us a little
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
bit late the governor usually gets up
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
that to us a couple weeks after his
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
proposed budget comes out
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
and as we go through this process i'm
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
sure you'll have many proposed
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
amendments to the trailer bill and
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's something that uh
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
i think the committee can take a look at
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
the division of transitional assistance
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
and tanf temporary assistance to needy
 
00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.829 align:start position:0%
and tanf temporary assistance to needy
families

00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
this is uh cash assistance and emergency
 
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
assistance to families with children in
 
00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:30.790 align:start position:0%
assistance to families with children in
which

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
one parent is absent
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
for one reason or another new hampshire
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
as as as karen alluded to uh when she
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
spoke earlier
 
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
hhs receives a lot of federal money that
 
00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.270 align:start position:0%
hhs receives a lot of federal money that
requires

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
requires
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
state funds to be spent in order to
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
receive it and tanf is a good example of
 
00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:49.670 align:start position:0%
receive it and tanf is a good example of
that

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire receives a 38 million
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
federal block grant
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
but in order to receive that funding it
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
has to spend 32 million dollars of state
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
money as a
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
so-called maintenance of effort and any
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
amount that we spend
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
below our maintenance of effort
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
requirement results in a corresponding
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
there is also a tanf reserve account
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
which isn't a formal account but it's
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
basically unspent federal tanf funds
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
and in the past that reserve has been
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
quite big it's gotten up in the 50
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
60 million dollar territory however over
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
the past few years
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
as eligibility requirements have changed
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
and his benefit levels have changed
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
and as the state has relied on tanf
 
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:34.870 align:start position:0%
and as the state has relied on tanf
funds

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
for a wide variety of programs
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
that reserve amount has has been drawn
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
down quite a bit
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
so in the last budget there was a lot of
 
00:38:45.599 --> 00:38:45.990 align:start position:0%
so in the last budget there was a lot of
work

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
done to try to make sure that the
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
reserve didn't quote fall below zero
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
even though it's
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
impossible for it to actually fall below
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
zero i think representative wallner has
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's about the tanf reserve fund i
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
wondered if we knew what the balance of
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
at this point and i don't know what it
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
right now that's not information that we
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
have access to at the lba we'll have to
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
go through the department for that
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
but they should they will be able to
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
provide that in the next couple weeks
 
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.430 align:start position:0%
provide that in the next couple weeks
usually

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
usually
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
they do provide a long document showing
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
where all the tanf funds are spent and
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
the projected balance at the end of the
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
biennium so we should get that going
 
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.310 align:start position:0%
biennium so we should get that going
forward

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
great thank you kevin sure
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
so moving on we have snap the
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
supplemental nutrition assistance
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
program this was previously known as
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
food stamps
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh not a huge state commitment here the
 
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:38.950 align:start position:0%
uh not a huge state commitment here the
cert

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
cert
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
the benefits themselves are 100
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
federally funded but the administrative
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
cost is shared 50 50 between the state
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to skip over the state
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
supplemental programs here old age
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
assistance a to the permanently and
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
totally disabled and a to the needy
 
00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:56.390 align:start position:0%
totally disabled and a to the needy
blind

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
blind
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
but we can come back if anybody wants to
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
talk about those
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
and we'll move on to the office of
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid business and policy and as i
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned that's the big one that's
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
where most of the money is
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
in hhs so we'll start with the
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care fund
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
which is sometimes also known as dish
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's the federal term uh
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
disproportional share payments to
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals that serve a disproportionate
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
share of
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
uh indigent patients basically
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
these are payments to hospitals to make
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
up for
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care from two sources one
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
is individuals without
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage who haven't been able
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
to pay their bill
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
or whose insurance coverage didn't pay
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
the entire bill
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
and the other is the gap between what
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
medicaid pays for services and the
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
actual cost to providing those services
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
so combined those are the hospitals
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care and the state makes
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
an effort
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
along with the federal government to
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
reimburse them for that uncompensated
 
00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.710 align:start position:0%
reimburse them for that uncompensated
care

00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
we fund that via a medicaid enhancement
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
tax on hospital
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
net patient service revenue now in the
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
past and i'm going
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
back in back into some of the history
 
00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.190 align:start position:0%
back in back into some of the history
here

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
the state collected met
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
matched it with federal funds and then
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
sent back to the hospitals immediately
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
that resulted in a federal audit
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
that resulted in the state paying back a
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
significant sum of money in
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
overpayments to hospitals and following
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
that audit
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
the state back in 2009 i think for the
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
first time
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
revised the the formula for dish
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
payments to hospitals
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
that revision followed by subsequent
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
revisions ended up in a slew of lawsuits
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
and the result is the agreement that we
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
have today that was put in place by 20
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
in 2018
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
and if we scroll down to the next page
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
here you can see the details of that
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
so the hospital pays back out to the
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
state rather pays back out to the
 
00:42:10.319 --> 00:42:11.589 align:start position:0%
state rather pays back out to the
hospitals

00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
an amount equal to 86 of that revenue in
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
the form of uncompensated care payments
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
an amount equal to five percent of that
 
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
revenue in the form of provider rate
 
00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.510 align:start position:0%
revenue in the form of provider rate
increases

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
increases
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
and up to 250 000 per year to each
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
deemed a disproportionate share
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
the difference between this and the
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
previous situation
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
is that hospitals don't necessarily get
 
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:37.589 align:start position:0%
is that hospitals don't necessarily get
back

00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
exactly what they paid in some may get
 
00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.069 align:start position:0%
exactly what they paid in some may get
back

00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
more than they paid in and met revenue
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
some may get back less
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
but they're not uh they're not held
 
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
harmless as they were
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.839 --> 00:42:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
2000s

00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
2000s
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
so of that net revenue that the state
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
collects a portion is paid out to the
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals and uncompensated care as i
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
just mentioned
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
a portion is dedicated to the state's
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
medicaid managed care program
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
so that met that's put towards the
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
medicaid managed care program
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
effectively reduces general funds spent
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
on medicaid because absent that met
 
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:19.349 align:start position:0%
on medicaid because absent that met
revenue

00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
the general fund would need to cover the
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
i have a costs here yes so
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
who who are the legislative subject
 
00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:32.390 align:start position:0%
who who are the legislative subject
matter

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
experts in the history of the met
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
i i would imagine we may have people on
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
the committee division three committee
 
00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.150 align:start position:0%
the committee division three committee
now

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
that were actually involved in
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
negotiating these details
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.800 --> 00:44:00.710 align:start position:0%
 
was

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
i think probably neil and maybe mary
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
jane was involved
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
i i was i yes i was i was on the
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
the committee that we met throughout the
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
summer of i can't remember what summer
 
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.390 align:start position:0%
summer of i can't remember what summer
but

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
it seemed like a long a long summer and
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
i'd like to talk agreement you about
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh so moving on
 
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
to medicaid care management
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
this is the single biggest component of
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
the hhs budget
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
this is the traditional medicaid program
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
for individuals who are
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
eligible as a result of their financial
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
status and their
 
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
falling into one one eligible category
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
or another
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
you can see that in including the
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
children's health insurance program
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
which is budgeted separately but was
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
previously part of the medicaid
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
managed care program the current
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
operating budget appropriated 743
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars and 20
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
and 760 million dollars and 21 for
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
medicaid managed care
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
and the agency budget request including
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
goes up to 813 million and 22 and 802
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
million in
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
23. this i believe is the only
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
program for which i've shown total funds
 
00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:25.839 align:start position:0%
rather than specifically general funds
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
for the reason that i just mentioned
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
because the met revenue that goes
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
towards medicaid managed care
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
can be thought of as general funds
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
because it effectively reduces the
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
general funds needed
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
so moving down we have the granted
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
advantage health care program
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
this is the expanded medicaid program
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
that went into effect as a result of the
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
federal affordable care act
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's been restructured a couple times
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
over the years most recently
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
in 2018. currently
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
under federal law the federal share of
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
program costs is 90
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
and the state share program cost is 10
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
under current federal law that's how the
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
funding mix
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
will remain so per that 2018 bill that
 
00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.470 align:start position:0%
will remain so per that 2018 bill that
restructured

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
restructured
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
the expanded medicaid program uh the
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
non-federal share of cost is to be
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
funded from three sources
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
insurance premium tax revenue
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
attributable to premiums written for
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
revenue transferred from the alcohol
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
abuse prevention and treatment fund
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
and revenue received from an assessment
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
on insurers
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
one thing that i will point out about
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
this is that this program is
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
off budget so you will not see the
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid program in the budget
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
that ultimately comes out
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
it does have an accounting unit
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
associated with it of course and i can
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
show you that at any time but it's not
 
00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:57.670 align:start position:0%
show you that at any time but it's not
actually

00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
a part of the operating budget
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's funded by a special non-budgeted
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
trust fund established in statute
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
total expenditures for the program have
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
been roughly 400 million per year and
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
that was true in fiscal 20 as well
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
with expenditures of 418.3 million
 
00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:18.950 align:start position:0%
with expenditures of 418.3 million
dollars

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
moving on to the bureau of elderly and
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
several years ago again in the in the
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
mid 2000s
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
there was an agreement struck between
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
counties and the state
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
in which the state picks up
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
the costs of services for youth
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
and counties pick up most of the cost
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
for long-term care services
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
so as you scroll through the budget and
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
you take a look at
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
nursing home services for example you'll
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
see that those are overwhelmingly
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
county funds matched with federal funds
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
relatively little overall so in the 2021
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
nursing nursing facility services cost
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
were appropriated for a total of 270
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
million per year
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
and the state commitment was about 14 to
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
16 million per year with the rest
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
split between counties and the federal
 
00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.870 align:start position:0%
split between counties and the federal
government

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
county payments though are capped in
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
state statute
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
and the amount of that cap changes with
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
each budget
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
so this is something that will be
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
included in
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill so in the previous
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
trailer bill for example the one
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
currently in effect
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
the county cap was established at 123.4
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
million in fiscal 20 and 126.9 million
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 21.
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
typically that amount does go up a bit
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
each year
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
counties also receive an aggregate
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
credit of 5 million dollars per year
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
which is intended to prevent them from
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
paying more than they would have paid
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
under the previous cost
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
there are a couple ways that the state
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
tries to leverage
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
federal funds to help out the nursing
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
facilities both private nursing
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
facilities and county run nursing
 
00:49:17.599 --> 00:49:18.790 align:start position:0%
facilities and county run nursing
facilities

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
one of those is the mqip program the
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
medicaid quality incentive program
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
which is funded by an assessment
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes colloquially known as the bed
 
00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.829 align:start position:0%
sometimes colloquially known as the bed
tax

00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
on nursing facility bed days
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
those funds are matched with federal
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
dollars and paid back out to
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
all nursing homes both public and
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
and private the pro-share program on the
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
other hand is specific to county nursing
 
00:49:46.319 --> 00:49:47.030 align:start position:0%
other hand is specific to county nursing
homes

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
homes
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
and that is an attempt to match federal
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
dollars with
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
state dollars to compensate nursing
 
00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
county nursing homes for the difference
 
00:49:56.839 --> 00:49:58.549 align:start position:0%
county nursing homes for the difference
between

00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
what medicaid pays for their services
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
and what medicare would pay for the same
 
00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:06.069 align:start position:0%
and what medicare would pay for the same
services

00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
yes okay i'm looking at
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
mqip okay a little slow on the uptake
 
00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:13.750 align:start position:0%
mqip okay a little slow on the uptake
here

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
but it looks like there's a five perc
 
00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:18.390 align:start position:0%
but it looks like there's a five perc
5.5

00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
5.5
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
effectively a tax on the nursing
 
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.309 align:start position:0%
effectively a tax on the nursing
facilities

00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
we collect it and we turn around and
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
give it back to them
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
yep so we must be taking it from
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
different people than we give it to
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
so who are who are the donors and who
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
are the recipients
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
um well that i don't know off the top of
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
my head i know we used to have
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure i can find a breakdown of
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
how enquip
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
is distributed between private nursing
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
homes in the aggregate and county
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
nursing homes in the aggregate
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if we ever had a breakdown
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
by each specific
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
nursing home uh but i'll see if we i'll
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
see what we can find on that
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's that's not a huge priority i'm just
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
i just
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
when i just it just seems like we're
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
taking money and putting in one pocket
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
and paying it out in the next and i just
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
curious about that um to some extent we
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
are but again it's an effort to match
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
federal dollars because everything that
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
we bring in is matched with federal
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
money and then
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
distributed back out to the nursing
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
homes representative irf had his hand up
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
for a moment or did you did jenna take
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
it down
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
it was the only to point out to you that
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
the real thing that's going on there
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
is the matching funds so it's actually
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
generating more money it's not just
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
taking out one pocket putting the others
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
take it out of the pocket matching it
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
and then splitting it back up again
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
fit to the same pockets with more money
 
00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:41.990 align:start position:0%
fit to the same pockets with more money
yes

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
the department's permitted under its uh
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
medicaid state plan to apply a budget
 
00:52:00.079 --> 00:52:01.190 align:start position:0%
medicaid state plan to apply a budget
neutrality

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
neutrality
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
factor to payments made to
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities and the reason for
 
00:52:07.359 --> 00:52:07.750 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities and the reason for
this

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that payments don't exceed
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
available appropriations so if the state
 
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
appropriates say
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
a total of 270 million dollars in funds
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
per year for nursing services but the
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
actual cost of services is more than
 
00:52:19.839 --> 00:52:20.470 align:start position:0%
actual cost of services is more than
that

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
the rates need to be reduced accordingly
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
so if they need to be
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
so if the budget is 20
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
more 20 less than the cost of services
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
the rates will be reduced
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
by twenty percent in order to bring them
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
in line with the budget
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh we'll move down to the division of
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
behavioral health
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
and the bureau of drug and alcohol
 
00:52:45.599 --> 00:52:50.150 align:start position:0%
and the bureau of drug and alcohol
services

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
the bureau provides oversight of
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
regional public health networks
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
and contracts with a variety of
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
providers to provide
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
impaired driver rehabilitation service
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
programs among
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
many other programs it's also
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for oversight
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
of for-profit methadone clinics
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
and this i believe you had a question
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
about this earlier representative
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
edwards um
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
this is where this is where new futures
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
would come into the
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
picture some of the funding under this
 
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:24.549 align:start position:0%
picture some of the funding under this
division

00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
scrolling down to the governor's
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
commission on alcohol and drug abuse
 
00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.390 align:start position:0%
commission on alcohol and drug abuse
prevention

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
five percent of gross liquor profits are
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
collected and distributed
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
to the governor's commission which
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
regularly meets and votes on
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
and votes to approve contracts
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
that percentage was in statute for many
 
00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:56.710 align:start position:0%
that percentage was in statute for many
years

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
but as you can see from fiscal 2004
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
through fiscal 2015 the legislature
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
suspended it
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
every year over that entire period and
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately appropriated an amount that
 
00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:06.790 align:start position:0%
ultimately appropriated an amount that
was

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
smaller than the five percent
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
from 2016 through 2018 though the
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
formula was changed
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
from 1.7 to 3.4 percent it bounced
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
around a little bit
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
but the legislature made an effort to
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
give to the alcohol commission
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
the full amount of funding that was
 
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
allowed by statute
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
and finally in 2018 as part of
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
the extension of the expanded medicaid
 
00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.470 align:start position:0%
the extension of the expanded medicaid
program

00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
the full five percent was reinstated and
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission now gets that
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
that that five percent has to be
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
transferred to the grand advantage
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
health care trust fund
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
to pay for the cost of the expanded
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
medicaid program with the department
 
00:54:56.079 --> 00:54:56.789 align:start position:0%
medicaid program with the department
essentially

00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
backfilling that amount to fund the
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
governor's commission
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
as of now that backfill comes from
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to community mental health
 
00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.150 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to community mental health
services

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
the largest components of this i think
 
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.670 align:start position:0%
the largest components of this i think
representative

00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
erf has a question here when you use the
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
word donations there is that in quotes
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
um it's it is a voluntary donation
 
00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:30.309 align:start position:0%
um it's it is a voluntary donation
there's

00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
there's an agreement with the state i
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
believe but it's a it's a voluntary
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
donation there's nothing in state
 
00:55:35.839 --> 00:55:36.549 align:start position:0%
donation there's nothing in state
statute

00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
that requires them to do it okay thank
 
00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:42.870 align:start position:0%
that requires them to do it okay thank
you

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
so if we move on to community mental
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
health services uh one of the main
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
accounts in there
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
is the cmh program support account
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
and that funds uh 10 community mental
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
health centers throughout the state i
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
believe there are now 10
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
and that received a general fund
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 22 million in fiscal 20
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
and 25 million and 21.
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
you can see the agency budget request
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
moving on to new hampshire hospital and
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
glencliff home
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
for the elderly there was a lot of
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
activity surrounding new hampshire
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
hospital in the 20 20
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
21 budget uh specifically the trailer
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
bill appropriated five million dollars
 
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
for an inpatient psychiatric facility
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
for children
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
as well as 8.75 million for the
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
construction of a new
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
25 bed facility for adults on the new
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
i don't believe those projects have gone
 
00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:39.589 align:start position:0%
i don't believe those projects have gone
forward

00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
but the department again will be in a
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
better position to talk about those when
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
moving on to developmental services
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
this is a significant part of the
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
medicaid program and state statute
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
requires the department to budget the
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
full costs of services
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
for persons with developmental
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities and acquired brain disorder
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
brain disorders and also requires the
 
00:57:08.319 --> 00:57:08.950 align:start position:0%
brain disorders and also requires the
legislative

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
legislature to provide sufficient
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
funding for those services
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
the operating budget contained 173
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
million in fiscal 20 and 183 million in
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
and you can see uh that the agency's
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
general fund request goes up a bit to
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
192 million and 22 and 212 million and
 
00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.230 align:start position:0%
192 million and 22 and 212 million and
23

00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
23
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
and i believe the intent of those
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
requests is to fully fund developmental
 
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
services for the
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
eligible populations and finally last
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
but not least moving on to the veterans
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
home which is not actually part of hhs
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
but it is part of division three's
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
purview uh the veterans homes
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
budget request is relatively flat
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
they're asking for a little bit more
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
they had 18 million and 18.4 million and
 
00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:54.390 align:start position:0%
they had 18 million and 18.4 million and
21

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
21
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
and they're requesting 18.3 and 19.1
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
million in the upcoming budget
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
so i have a question there and it's
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
actually a a request of the veterans
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
home when they come to present to us
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
okay um full full disclaimer
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
i'm eligible to be put away in this
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
veterans home someday
 
00:58:14.079 --> 00:58:19.190 align:start position:0%
veterans home someday
so

00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
having said that i i would just be
 
00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.190 align:start position:0%
having said that i i would just be
curious

00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
curious
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
what uh given their average census
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh i would like to know how much they
 
00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:29.910 align:start position:0%
uh i would like to know how much they
spend

00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
spend
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
per patient say per year
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
whatever the denominator is per day per
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
year per month whatever
 
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
per patient per period compared to
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
say a typical county home in new
 
00:58:45.359 --> 00:58:46.230 align:start position:0%
say a typical county home in new
hampshire

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
okay i'd like to just understand
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
if um if we're if we're doing what we
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
should for veterans if we're gold
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
plating it relative to county care
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
i just i'd like to i just would like to
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
know relatively
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
how we're doing is that something they
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
typically provide anyways
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
that sort of comparison um not
 
00:59:06.319 --> 00:59:07.190 align:start position:0%
that sort of comparison um not
necessarily

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
but i can let them know what you're
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
looking for and they should be able to
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
uh come in with that
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
i'll let them pick the benchmark they
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
can compare to
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
i just it should be a reasonable
 
00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
benchmark is all i ask so that we can do
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
an apples to apples for close to it
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
okay okay do you have anything else to
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
to wrap up this is a great presentation
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
i notice your style's a little different
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
than mr kane's
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
i'm glad he was here for that you'll
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
enjoy that one
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
oh i think you're i think you're muted
 
00:59:48.079 --> 00:59:49.750 align:start position:0%
oh i think you're i think you're muted
representative

00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
oh i i saw him on there i wouldn't have
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
said it otherwise
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
i was breathing off off camera i'm
 
00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.230 align:start position:0%
i was breathing off off camera i'm
breathing

00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
breathing
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
oh you're muted again let's see
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to mute in case the dogs go
 
01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.150 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to mute in case the dogs go
nuts

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
nuts
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
so unless you have any uh summary wrap
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
up on that i think that was great do you
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
want to take questions does anyone have
 
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:14.630 align:start position:0%
want to take questions does anyone have
any

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
questions given that we just went
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any okay we can come back
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
if there are some
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
so the next topic is discussion on
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
process committee deadline
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
zoom meeting best practices um
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
i uh i threw some bullets in here
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to make sure we talked
 
01:00:40.079 --> 01:00:41.270 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to make sure we talked
about

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
and that is that uh for as far as the
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
eye can see
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to have either uh well from
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
here on it's going to be hybrid
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
i believe that there's been a commitment
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
from the lba
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
to have us set up in the committee room
 
01:00:56.799 --> 01:00:57.670 align:start position:0%
to have us set up in the committee room
for

01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh one week from today uh but there is
 
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.309 align:start position:0%
uh one week from today uh but there is
absolutely

01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
no pressure for me to for anybody
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
to show up in person i i want to be
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
there in person
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
but there's no pressure from me on
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
anyone i
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
i'd kind of like to know in advance
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
where you think you're going to be just
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
in case i want to chat with you i'd like
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
to know how to do that
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
um is there any any uh commentary on on
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
hybrid meetings
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
i got a i got a note from uh somebody in
 
01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.270 align:start position:0%
i got a i got a note from uh somebody in
uh

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
leadership that they think that we could
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
use the house chamber for a
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
finance committee meeting briefing and
 
01:01:41.599 --> 01:01:41.990 align:start position:0%
finance committee meeting briefing and
the

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
plan might be for us to do that in the
 
01:01:44.319 --> 01:01:45.190 align:start position:0%
plan might be for us to do that in the
february

01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
february
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
presentation so we can get a whole
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
committee in there that's where they put
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
24 senators
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
and we could be in as they have little a
 
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
desk and a little microphone at each of
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
the places that are set up in the
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
house chamber and so we could we could
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
meet there with separation and so on
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
and each be able to be on a mic when we
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
had a question
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
and that might be what we do for the
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
governor's budget presentation because
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
they supposedly changed the whole
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
hvac system in the
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
in the house chamber so that the proper
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
ventilation and
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
i guess um ultraviolet lights have been
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
installed in the
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
events and so on so they think it's it's
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
just about ready so
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
well that's good to hear i think they
 
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
put a lot of detail in the house
 
01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:39.829 align:start position:0%
put a lot of detail in the house
calendar

01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
that i didn't intend to repeat for
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
everyone but
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
i i do think a lot of effort is going on
 
01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.549 align:start position:0%
i i do think a lot of effort is going on
to

01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
um to respect cdc recommendations on the
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
precautions and to
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
all right um representative walter do
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
you you have anything you want to add
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
on the discussion of hybrid you got your
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
are you talking uh i do have my uh my
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am representative weiler do you
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
know are we for sure
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
going to have the briefing from the
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
governor on his budget on
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
we had an earlier discussion and nobody
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
knows for sure
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
whether we'll have it on the 11th or the
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
16th the 15th
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
possibly being a holiday so you know one
 
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
would hope we would get it before the
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
holiday rather than after
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
but those for sure yet
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately okay could i have a
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
i also um will we also be seeing
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
um house bill 2 at the same time
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
i think we put that in law last time
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
that it had to be we did
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
i think you did in the last budget so
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i did
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
traditionally we did we did yeah
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
and so okay and hopefully it's delivered
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
at the same point because that's what i
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
remember we put in law
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you unreasonable to
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
wait and
 
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
see it much later representative norgren
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
i saw your hand go up but i'm gonna
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
allow mr cain to speak first in case he
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
answers your question
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
sure i i just wanted to add um that
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
the governor may present his
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
typically what happens if the governor
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
presents the full house or does the
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
state of the state on his budget
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
we've heard it could be the 11th
 
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
although that is in about two weeks so
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty quick um i think
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
f how he does that is probably something
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
that the governor's office is discussing
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
with leadership right now whether it be
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
similar to his
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
um state of the union address or his
 
01:04:54.799 --> 01:04:56.069 align:start position:0%
um state of the union address or his
inauguration

01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
inauguration
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
where it is remote but what
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative weiler was mentioning
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
is that he usually the governor usually
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
does he or she comes into the house
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
to present their budget kind of a kick
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
off to the
 
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
budget process and we'll come in with
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
the budget director so his new budget
 
01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.270 align:start position:0%
the budget director so his new budget
director

01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
matt mayo is his name and i think on the
 
01:05:16.559 --> 01:05:17.270 align:start position:0%
matt mayo is his name and i think on the
16th

01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
16th
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
and i think again leadership
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative wyler janet will work
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
with the governor to see if he's
 
01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:23.029 align:start position:0%
with the governor to see if he's
available

01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully on the 16th would come and
 
01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.309 align:start position:0%
hopefully on the 16th would come and
present

01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
present
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh either virtually or um or in person
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
probably virtually to the full finance
 
01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.430 align:start position:0%
probably virtually to the full finance
committee

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
and that would be in a hybrid capacity
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
as representative weiler had stated
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
the house chamber actually when they did
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
upgrade the air conditioning they
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
did a full upgrade of the entire
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
ventilation system so that is
 
01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
in the whole complex that's one room
 
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
that is actually a safe room and that's
 
01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:50.870 align:start position:0%
that is actually a safe room and that's
why

01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
the senate's able to meet there the
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
again smaller group the only 24 of them
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
but it does have the proper air exchange
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
has been set up
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh with hybrid capabilities so that
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
members who do not attend are still able
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
to participate
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
um as well as the agencies if they're
 
01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:08.630 align:start position:0%
um as well as the agencies if they're
presenting

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
presenting
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
um are able and so i think that's the um
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's the game plan i think there's
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
still obviously
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
it's a couple weeks anything can happen
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
between now and then but i know that
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh leadership's working to um
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
come up with the plan for that okay
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
so um i don't know if it was technology
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
or representative nordgren
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
did you did you get your question
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
answered do you still have something
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
no i think i think probably we'll know
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
more or later i'm just
 
01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
obviously concerned about showing up and
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
the mask rule and what that whole
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
uh in that room what will be the
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
situation with mass
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
and keeping people safe so i assume
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
there'll be more information coming
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
i would assume that too and i just would
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate that
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh if you're not comfortable coming in
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
please don't
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll try to figure out how to
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
accommodate you so that you feel like
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
you're a full participant
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
the next step uh public access before
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
during and after so
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh i just want to remind you that once
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
you get on zoom
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh you might uh already be
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
accessible to the public view and
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
so i i just would caution you to make
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
your setting and your dress code and
 
01:07:35.599 --> 01:07:36.549 align:start position:0%
your setting and your dress code and
everything

01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh what you're saying to your your
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
spouse all of that stuff
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know that may be live in public uh
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
as soon as you turn on zoom so that's
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's just a caution i i've asked
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
um i've asked uh mr ripple to let me
 
01:07:52.799 --> 01:07:53.750 align:start position:0%
um i've asked uh mr ripple to let me
know

01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
um if they if they go live
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
um but i i i correct me if i'm wrong did
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
i say
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
um let me tell you that we can go live
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
like five minutes before
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
or what did i say recording i forget
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
what i said
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh you talked to me i think briefly
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative edwards about
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
um like five we'll wait for you to give
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
the okay
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
before the video's turned on because if
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
it is if it is
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
a case where members are getting ready
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
getting settled there's no need to have
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
that video on
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
um but we'll wait for you if for some
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
reason you forget to notify us we'll
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
definitely start it by the time uh once
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
you open the meeting so we'll make sure
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
there's no excess
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
video i just don't want anybody
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
accidentally embarrassing themselves
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
with us being public when we shouldn't
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
so um also
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
dress codes and non-partisan backdrops i
 
01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
i would hope that we all think of our
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
virtual environment
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
as an extension of
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
the decorum of the house meaning that
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
we don't while we don't have a dress
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
code i think each individual
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
attempts to address professionally when
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
they when they go to
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
committee and so because this is subject
 
01:09:11.759 --> 01:09:12.390 align:start position:0%
committee and so because this is subject
to

01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
public uh viewing i i would hope that
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
you would use that same dress code
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
and then we're not supposed to have any
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
partisan backdrops
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
so so if you have any flags
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
hanging in the back uh please don't show
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
it that's i think the virtual background
 
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.349 align:start position:0%
it that's i think the virtual background
helps

01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
helps
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
protect against that sort of thing
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
and an extension of that is i
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
i would like you all to be comfortable
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
leaving your cameras
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
active during the meeting and
 
01:09:47.829 --> 01:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
we can talk about that but i i think as
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
i read article 38 of the new hampshire
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
constitution last 10 to 15 words
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
of it really to me say that we are meant
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
to conduct our legislative business
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
um in public view with full transparency
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
so so to me that means we should have
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
our cameras on
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
um and be live now so
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
so representative bean i don't want to
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
put you on the spot is do you have a
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
technology issue there
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
i don't know much about this tablet it's
 
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
it's relatively new
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
i'll have to uh talk to somebody
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
that's more technological than i am
 
01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
and see if i can get this squared away
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
between now and then
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay i would not ask you to spend
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
additional money
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
on technology i'd i'd just say if you
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
have the capability it'd be great if you
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
would leverage it for um being
 
01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
in viewing and then uh representative
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
nordgren uh i'd i'd
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
love to hear what you have to say go
 
01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
ahead um
 
01:11:05.709 --> 01:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
for full disclosure i'm actually in
 
01:11:05.719 --> 01:11:07.350 align:start position:0%
for full disclosure i'm actually in
dartmouth-hitchcock

01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
dartmouth-hitchcock
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with heart issues so i could
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
turn it on and you could see my room
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
but um hopefully i'll be back in
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
operation next week
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
well i i hope i hope you have a great
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
visit and you
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
have a full and speedy recovery i would
 
01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.510 align:start position:0%
have a full and speedy recovery i would
not

01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
ask anyone to have their privacy
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
violated in any way
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying you know as a general
 
01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.149 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying you know as a general
rule

01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
i i think we should be transparent
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a an aspirational goal
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
but you should definitely do it in a way
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
in which
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
and i it's a beautiful room by the way
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
and it looks like they ran your iv very
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
well so
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
right and i'm watching the construction
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
site i'm supervising
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh are there any other comments like i
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
don't want anyone to feel
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
abused and have their privacy taken from
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
them but
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh is are there any comments about this
 
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
you're the chair is this consistent with
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
the guidance you're given other
 
01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.590 align:start position:0%
the guidance you're given other
divisions

01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
divisions
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
so if if you ever have an issue with
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
that just reach out and and talk to me
 
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i'm open
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
um so as i understand
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
the feedback i'm getting from other
 
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
people who've run zoom meetings is that
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
when people
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
get on zoom they're they're kind of
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
isolated in their own
 
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
room and they don't have the same
 
01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.110 align:start position:0%
room and they don't have the same
benefit

01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
of watching people's body languages and
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
so they tend to run on a lot longer
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
so so if we are in a hybrid situation
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
and you're
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
speaking remotely i would just ask you
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
keep it succinct you know just just keep
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
in mind
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
that there is this behavioral issue
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
where people
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
speaking to zoom kind of like i'm doing
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
now just run on and on and on and on and
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
and we just need to keep it sync hit it
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
and get it
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh in line with that
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
i would say um in the previous
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
committees i've been on
 
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
the chair was in each committee was very
 
01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:20.870 align:start position:0%
the chair was in each committee was very
rigid

01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
rigid
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
or maybe the words discipline very
 
01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:23.990 align:start position:0%
or maybe the words discipline very
disciplined

01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
disciplined
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
on allowing one question at a time from
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
a representative
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
and after the question the
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative would go back to the
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
chairman to say
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like a follow-up okay because
 
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:36.550 align:start position:0%
i'd like a follow-up okay because
because

01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
we're already handicapped i think by the
 
01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.229 align:start position:0%
we're already handicapped i think by the
technology

01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
what i what i think i'd like to do is
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
once you start
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
asking questions to kind of just give me
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
an idea how many questions you've got
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
and just keep rolling i don't i
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's good given the
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
limitations of the virtual environment
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
to have to keep going back and forth
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
playing ping pong
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
with each question so so representative
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
wallner you have your hand up
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
do you want to thank you i think you
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
just covered it actually
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
um since the finance committee is a
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
little different because
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of the questioning that we have is
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
of department heads or
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
agency people to um answer our financial
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
the questions about finances
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
often you'll ask a question and often it
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
brings you to another question because
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
you need to
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
sort of go down that track
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
um and if you have to wait then to ask
 
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
to ask the follow-up question after
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
everybody else has
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
done it it it breaks the chain of
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
thought really so
 
01:14:47.189 --> 01:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
i think if we can have follow-up
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
questions and try to keep them
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay good so so you're not you're not
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
disagreeing we're all aligned there
 
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
no no i think it goes without saying
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
that i reserve the right to
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
cut off questioning at some point but i
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
just would like to know
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
i would just like to have some idea how
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know how long it needs to run
 
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
for you to be comfortable we're making
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
big decisions and i don't want anyone to
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
feel like they
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
they don't have the information they
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
need to make their own
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
um anything else on the on on those two
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
topics because
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
um i my next step would be laptops and
 
01:15:27.679 --> 01:15:29.270 align:start position:0%
um i my next step would be laptops and
fluids

01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
fluids
 
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
so my thought on this is certainly if
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
you're in a virtual environment
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
you can have um your
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
a beverage with you uh
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
i'm i and i would even say if we're
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
meeting with the department
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh i view those as probably more like
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
working sessions than public hearings
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
i i would tend to say if you want to
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
have a cup of coffee with you
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
while we're here in department briefs
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
that that's okay
 
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
would you would you agree or disagree mr
 
01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.990 align:start position:0%
would you would you agree or disagree mr
chairman

01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative weiler i i don't want to
 
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
if you're in your own home
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
and i've seen it on most of the zone
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
calls people taking a sip of something
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh you're in your own home you're fairly
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable so i don't think anybody can
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
object to that but
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
when we're in we're in the committee
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
room it's
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
because the cleaning staff doesn't want
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
to clean up crumbs and
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
right coffee stains okay so and then
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
we had a pretty hard no laptop rule
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh in the previous committees but the
 
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
world has changed
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
and now i can see us needing a laptop so
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
that we know what's going on with the
 
01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.229 align:start position:0%
that we know what's going on with the
virtual

01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
virtual
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
team members so so i would ask
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
that you you don't play games or goof
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
around on your
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
laptop but if you need it up so that you
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
can participate
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know more fully in the meeting i i
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm pro-laptop in committee hearings
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
is there is there any just disagreement
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay um now hearing none
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh that sort of wraps up the discussion
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
oh i didn't see it thank you thank you
 
01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
so much because if i couldn't have my um
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
as everybody on the committee that's
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
been there knows i live on the laptop
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
and um and take lots of notes so um
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
if i can't have my mini i would probably
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
have a nervous breakdown or somehow
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
um don't know what i'd do during the
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
session but um i don't play games and i
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
don't do whatever but
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's invaluable to me to be able to go
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
back and check
 
01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
notes of what um happened and so forth
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
so i really appreciate
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
that you would let me continue that
 
01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.189 align:start position:0%
that you would let me continue that
practice

01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
of having my laptop to take notes with
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i am fine with that and as
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
long as we're not
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
violating the finance chairs guidelines
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with it i would just ask you to
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
for one boundary condition uh a reason
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
not to have laptops is because if you
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
have the public there
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
the public wants to be able to you know
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
see you
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
and interact with you and not think that
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
you're you know messing around so
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
so as you're using your laptop if you
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
could just
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
push position it in a place where you
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
still have
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
visualization of the public that would
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
be great my mini is about
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
an inch bigger than your your cell phone
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
so oh
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay well that's not a problem um
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
all right so i had sent
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
out a template on some things that i
 
01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:53.990 align:start position:0%
out a template on some things that i
would

01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
like um to have the the departments come
 
01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:58.310 align:start position:0%
like um to have the the departments come
in

01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
ready to ask uh i should try that
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know as long as we're doing this i
 
01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
should try to do a share
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
do you want to tell me how to share
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
go to your share screen at the bottom of
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
thing and hit that there should be a
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
um right underneath the pictures if
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
you're looking at gallery view kind of
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the screen
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
yep so are you seeing something called
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
division three chairman's template or
 
01:19:27.669 --> 01:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
are you seeing much there it is
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
yes yes oh wow god this is so great
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay so um i don't know if you've had a
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
chance to look at it i
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
i did float it by representative walner
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
and irf
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
um and mr ripple before and maybe
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh maybe some others so so so these are
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
the kinds of things that i think i would
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
like to know routinely
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
when they're relevant to a particular
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
department and representative wallner
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
asked me a good question
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
kind of the goldilocks question of of
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
which departments are too big to be
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
answering these kinds of questions and
 
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
which of them are too small and i don't
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
really have
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
a a good guideline on that
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
unless mr ripple or mr kane you've come
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
up with one
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
i i would tend to just send it to the
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
departments and say
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
answer to these to the question that you
 
01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0%
perceive them
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
to be relevant to the committee's
 
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
decision making
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
and and don't go reinvent the wheel
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
or try too hard to come up with answers
 
01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:33.990 align:start position:0%
or try too hard to come up with answers
right

01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
i would i'd leave it to common sense
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
unless you've got
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
a protocol you'd like to recommend
 
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
i think that makes sense i i was unable
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
to come up with a hard and fast rule i i
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
think i mentioned when we talked about
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
this that
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
the department puts out a briefing book
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
with all accounting units
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
greater than a million dollars now that
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
much too low that would be much too low
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
a level i think to provide all of this
 
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
information but they do provide some of
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
it in there so
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
some of that information is already
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
available and perhaps they could fill in
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
so so i don't know how many of you i
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to go line by line on this
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
but i do want to make sure that if you
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
think there's a question on here that
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to you that i uh i
 
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
edit it before we send it to the
 
01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.189 align:start position:0%
edit it before we send it to the
department

01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
or if i'm missing something that you you
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
would like to normally know
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
we can add that and and i'd like to give
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
this to
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
release this to mr ripple tomorrow so
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
that the departments have a heads up
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
that we're asking this and
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
i think i saw representative rogers hand
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
go up and then representative nordgren
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
what do you have representative rogers
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
yeah my my only
 
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
request would be that we understand that
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
not every and not every question on this
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
i think can be answered by the
 
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
department in that this is as much more
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
of a business model
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
and when we're dealing with um health
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
and human service agencies
 
01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:04.719 align:start position:0%
there's not always a business answer in
 
01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:05.510 align:start position:0%
there's not always a business answer in
that

01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
um while i know that the
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
people would like to say that they're
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
customers and that they
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
they have a black and white answer
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more gray areas that we
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
deal with here
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
than in then and quite often than other
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
parts of state government when we for
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
instance deal with the
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
disability community there's an awful
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
lot of gray area
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
the way the pandemic for instance has
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
affected them
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
um with a lot of them lost their
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
caregivers because of the pandemic
 
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
the way that it affected them it's very
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
hard for agencies to then come back
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
and predict how this is going to affect
 
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
two years if it changes we don't know
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
when it changes or if
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
it however um i think there's a lot more
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
gray area than can be specifically
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
answered here so i guess i would ask
 
01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:01.590 align:start position:0%
answered here so i guess i would ask
that

01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
um we not be kind of
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
um a hundred percent say you have to
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
answer this
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
specifically because i think that
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's just
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
too much that they specifically can't be
 
01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:14.629 align:start position:0%
too much that they specifically can't be
answered

01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
answered
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
i think they can attempt to but i just
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
look at all the different areas and
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
my experience and i know that sharon and
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
mary jane have even more
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
but when you deal with child care the
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
disability community
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
the elderly community that just the way
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has affected them over the
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
and the way it will continue to and how
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
they project out and how they even look
 
01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:35.189 align:start position:0%
they project out and how they even look
at

01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
what's happened it's going to be very
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
answer some of these with black and
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
white answers black and white
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
is just impossible i think i can
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
i i i think if uh well one
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
i i don't want them to over engineer the
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
effort to answer the questions
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
i i this is the kind of things that i
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
tend to think about
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
and i think if they come across a
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
question that this just doesn't fit
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
if they were to say that and say why it
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit i think
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
that would facilitate learning on my
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
part if not others
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
so i think maybe if we can just put a
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
kind of provision at the beginning of it
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
that we do understand
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
that that's a possibility yes ma'am i
 
01:24:18.239 --> 01:24:18.870 align:start position:0%
that that's a possibility yes ma'am i
will

01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh work to um make this purpose
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
statement a little bit
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh responsive to what you just said
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you you bet so so
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
in order i i think i had representative
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
nordgren up next and then representative
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh weiler and walner in that order
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think i was just gonna make a
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
nuts and boat comment
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
so whenever the governor presents the
 
01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:46.870 align:start position:0%
so whenever the governor presents the
budget

01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
particularly to the house and senate
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
then immediately we get this giant book
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's about six inches tall
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
and uh those of us who've been around
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
around a long time
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
we take out uh section
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
five of that huge book and we put it in
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
its own little binder
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
so i guess the question will be that um
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
mr ripple and mr kane can put on their
 
01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.310 align:start position:0%
mr ripple and mr kane can put on their
list

01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
of those people who then are going to do
 
01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:20.550 align:start position:0%
of those people who then are going to do
virtual

01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
virtual
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
we will need to have that section of the
 
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:24.470 align:start position:0%
we will need to have that section of the
budget

01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
i'll let mr ripple answer that since
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
um and i can answer it just so you put
 
01:25:40.229 --> 01:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
kevin on the
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
spot yeah well um so that's what we're
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with right now is
 
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
um the logistics of
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
making sure that members who are in
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
person as well as members who are remote
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh have the same materials and so we
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
will do that represent our
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
our plan and we we were talking about
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
this last couple days
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
within the office our plan is to make
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone gets a hard copy
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
of the governor's budget if you want us
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
to separate that out
 
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:10.719 align:start position:0%
we can do that and separate just um
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
category five for the division members
 
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
um maybe we will talk about that because
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
maybe we can break it down into the
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
three divisions
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
um like three sections so instead of
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
getting one big
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh governor's budget you would get three
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
each division you'd you'd get the whole
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
thing everyone would get the whole thing
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
but you'd have them broken down so you
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
could always grab your section only as
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
you're writing notes and going through
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
that and so
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we'll talk we'll talk uh with
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
the staff in the best way how to do that
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
just to make sure you each get
 
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
everything and your own
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay i'm sure you're on the case i
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring it up to the new
 
01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:52.470 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring it up to the new
members

01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you and if and if you can uh
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
basically hardwire it
 
01:26:58.950 --> 01:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
so that we get it the way you think it
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
should be that would be really kind of
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
nice i think
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
yep so so representative weiler i
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
believe you were next sir
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh one of the
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
things that is our
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
duty in going over the budget year by
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
year is to
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
look at areas of efficiency and every
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
once in a while we're in it
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
in a situation where we have to make
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
some pretty drastic changes
 
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
so one of the things i would add in
 
01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
in writing to these different groups
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
that come into us would be
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
what you consider the most vital part of
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
your agency
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
and what which part is the least
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
vital and you probably get
 
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
90 of them 80 will say oh it's all
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
vital but every once in a while you will
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
get a disclosure where somebody says
 
01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.510 align:start position:0%
get a disclosure where somebody says
well

01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
this such and such part was imposed on
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
me i'm not comfortable with it blah blah
 
01:27:54.239 --> 01:27:54.870 align:start position:0%
me i'm not comfortable with it blah blah
blah

01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
blah
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
or it's not as important as it was when
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
i first took
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
over but it's becoming less important it
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
kind of gives us a clue
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
as to where we might be making the most
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
changes to save the most money
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
there might be some part of it that has
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
almost become you know
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
no longer relevant but they just keep
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
people there because they don't want to
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
lay anybody off
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
i mean that's that's kind of extreme but
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
there are there are instances where
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen things like that that
 
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
or maybe that division should be
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere else or that
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
piece of that the operation should be
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere else but
 
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to get some serious
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
questions now about sununu youth center
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
and if we did make further reductions
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
what would we do with this expensive uh
 
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
building that was not put up that long
 
01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:42.390 align:start position:0%
building that was not put up that long
ago

01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
to fully utilize it those are the things
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
that we've got to look at and there's a
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
big piece of property there that
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sure developers and the city of
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
manchester would like to
 
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
get their hands on so those are things
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
we've got to be thinking of when we go
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
through all this
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
and uh you know that we'd be the ones
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
that would have to make those changes
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
because quite often they have to be made
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
in law
 
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
so those are just things that you might
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
get some
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
if you asked the agencies what's your
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
most vital
 
01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
function and what's your least so i'm
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
hoping we get some
 
01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
honest answers that might give us a hint
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
so as i was thinking about that i
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
i could just imagine from my days being
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
a government employee
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh how you would not want to put in
 
01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:30.390 align:start position:0%
uh how you would not want to put in
writing

01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
writing
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
the least vital part of your department
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
because you would know that
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to get stomped on and get
 
01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:37.590 align:start position:0%
it's going to get stomped on and get
your

01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
chain of command upset at you at the
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
same time so
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
so i wonder i wonder if if there's um if
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
we we should talk about that some more
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind sir okay
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
oh thank you i'm i'm sort of going back
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
to the template
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
but i did i want to just mention again
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
it's already been mentioned that one of
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
the most useful documents we're going to
 
01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:14.950 align:start position:0%
the most useful documents we're going to
have

01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
is the briefing book from health and
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
human services
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know if all the new members have
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
actually had a look at
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
previous briefing books but it's very
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
very complete
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
i would say most of the questions that
 
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
are on this template
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
are answered that you do have some that
 
01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.189 align:start position:0%
are answered that you do have some that
were

01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
would might not have been on it but i
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
think you'll find it to be
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
probably one of the best documents we
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
have as we go through the budget
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
it really lays out um the case for
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
what the department's doing and all the
 
01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:49.830 align:start position:0%
what the department's doing and all the
financial

01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
information um it's it's quite a good
 
01:30:52.719 --> 01:30:54.070 align:start position:0%
information um it's it's quite a good
document

01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
okay well i'll i'll take a look at that
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
i have not seen one i've not looked at
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
one yet
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
but thank you for the advice
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
and i don't want i don't want redundancy
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask him to do something
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
twice i just
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that this is within
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
um representative erf
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
this is a question or a comment back for
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
lba again regarding documents
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
if when you do the splitting up of the
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
physical document the budget you'd also
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
do it
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
electronically and posting those as well
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
same thing with the brief ebook and also
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
the same thing with any documents that
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
or presentations that the department is
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
going to bring forward if they could
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
have those posted
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
or available the day before so we could
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
download them and have them ready to go
 
01:31:45.110 --> 01:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
while they're going through them
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's our plan going forward we'd love
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
for all the agencies to provide any
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
documents ahead of time instead of the
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
day of
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh kevin had briefly mentioned it this
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
year we're going to have division
 
01:31:56.239 --> 01:31:57.590 align:start position:0%
year we're going to have division
specific

01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
sites on our website so that every
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
document you have
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
will be presented and what we can do is
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
yes as you said we could have category 5
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
for instance specifically a link to that
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
on the websites too but i'll work with
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
kevin i'll work on breaking that pdf
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
down when we do receive it from the
 
01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:17.270 align:start position:0%
down when we do receive it from the
governor

01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
um in a division friendly manner and
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
then we'll make sure that we
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
post everything and hopefully keep being
 
01:32:22.639 --> 01:32:24.149 align:start position:0%
post everything and hopefully keep being
searchable

01:32:24.149 --> 01:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
searchable
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
yes and keep it searchable that's the
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
key and i have talked to uh
 
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal uh this past time was not
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
searchable but we'll make sure that all
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
the documents are searchable
 
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
um our next meeting uh is scheduled for
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
one week from today at 1 pm
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
um we've we've had new futures in
 
01:32:48.639 --> 01:32:49.430 align:start position:0%
um we've we've had new futures in
waypoint

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
waypoint
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
ask us if they could come in and talk to
 
01:32:52.159 --> 01:32:53.830 align:start position:0%
ask us if they could come in and talk to
us

01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
and i the guidelines i gave them was
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
no more than 10 minutes i gave them some
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines on
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
the kinds of things that they should put
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
in their document
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
i ask them to send the documents on a
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
read ahead basis so we can distribute it
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
you can look at it
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
i i thought it would be okay to schedule
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
this because we still have
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
a little uh dead time between now and
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
when we really get to work on the
 
01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
and this might be a way to learn
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
more about the department um if you
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
don't think this
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
adds value to you as a committee member
 
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's okay for you to not come but we'll
 
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
do a public meeting
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
and it'll be open to the public um i i
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
don't really like to talk to lobbyists
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh one-on-one just as a general rule i
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like those conversations to be as
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
public and transparent as possible
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
and so this is a way to do it the the
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh that that representative weiler and i
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
have talked about
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
is to have um the ag's office the doj
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
come over and talk to us about
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuits my original idea was i
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of know about pending
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuits so we could have some idea of
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
what kind of contingency risk reserves
 
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
we might need to be thinking about but
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
but uh but i've been convinced that
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's probably not going to
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
be available to us because of uh the
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
need for confidentiality and not
 
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh sharing information uh that shouldn't
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
be in the public domain so
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
so representative weiler has suggested
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
instead that we kind of take a
 
01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.870 align:start position:0%
instead that we kind of take a
historical

01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
historical
 
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
view of the kind of lawsuits that are
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
hitting dhhs
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
and um you know you know representative
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
weiler do you
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
do you want to talk a little bit about
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh your idea on this i think
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
i think mr ripple's been in contact with
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
the doj but
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
everyone should kind of hear what you're
 
01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.270 align:start position:0%
everyone should kind of hear what you're
thinking

01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
well as as you and i discussed um
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
and then the accountability for hhs
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
isn't very high uh you could have the
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
same person
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
getting in trouble all the time and
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
being sued a lot of the time but once
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
once the lawsuit is filed it goes over
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
the attorney general
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
and if there's a settlement the attorney
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
general comes to fiscal and says i need
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
some money
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
and we put a certain amount of money in
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
their budget anyway for
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
settlements but we never put in as much
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
as we think we'll need
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
because it becomes a target for lawyers
 
01:35:33.679 --> 01:35:34.629 align:start position:0%
because it becomes a target for lawyers
so

01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
what we do is we put in an amount they
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
come back to fiscal but
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
the hhs gets to wash their hands
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
of what could be a problem and it could
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
be a certain person that's a problem and
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
so the accountability leaves the agency
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
it goes over the ag
 
01:35:55.830 --> 01:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
and you know i i'm not comfortable with
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
the ag not even
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
involving us i mean i've i've done
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
things in the budget there was a lawsuit
 
01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:01.669 align:start position:0%
things in the budget there was a lawsuit
that

01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:05.669 --> 01:36:05.679 align:start position:0%
that occurred and i waited for the ag to
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
interview me
 
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
to know how best to reply never got an
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
interview i called them up and said
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
what statement do you want from me oh
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
we're okay
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
so you know it seems to me we're not
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
being properly represented
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
by the by the department of justice
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
if we're being sued over our actions we
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
should be involved
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
and they're just totally ignoring us
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
and i i don't find that very good
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
practice of law
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
so that's a point i'm gonna make with
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
them and if if we had
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
some accountability within hhs so that
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
if they had the same person getting sued
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
multiple times for the same sort of
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
behavior what are they doing about it
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know they're just ignoring it and
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
brushing it off to the ag so
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
i think that's a conversation we have to
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
have thank you
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um are any comments
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
on on that i mean not very loud jess
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh are there any comments on that i i
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
think from the
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh the folks that have been experienced
