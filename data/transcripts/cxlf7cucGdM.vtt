if
 
00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 align:start position:0%
I'll call a finance committee to order
 
00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 align:start position:0%
and first on our schedule we have the
 
00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services I
 
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
see the commissioner and his able staff
 
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
here to explain the handout that uh Mr
 
00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 align:start position:0%
Ripple has just passed out

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
so there we go all three of us here for
 
00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:22.909 align:start position:0%
so there we go all three of us here for
you

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
um I have a handout to sort of guide our
 
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
discussion based on what I think you
 
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
wanted to hear based on uh rumors and
 
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
innuendos about what went on and was
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
said in meetings and that you had
 
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
interest in
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
um but uh if you look at page two it's
 
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
sort of a table of contents I'm going to
 
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
talk about governance collective
 
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
bargaining inflation the classification
 
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
system reforming the system Recruitment
 
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
and hiring
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start on page three talking
 
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
about the governance system
 
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
the executive branch job classification
 
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
system and employee compensation think
 
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
of it as the civil service system I try
 
00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 align:start position:0%
to explain this to people because we use
 
00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of terms that people don't
 
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
necessarily understand
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
what do you mean what's the
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
classification system what is that what
 
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
is that thing and it you know I don't
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
want to get into a discussion of the
 
00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 align:start position:0%
obsession nation of James Garfield and
 
00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
the creation of a merit system and and
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
Social Security Act amendments from the
 
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
from the 30s but
 
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 align:start position:0%
um we're governed by state and federal
 
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
law administrative rules collective
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement between the state
 
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
and 14 different unions which is more
 
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
than it used to be and it seems like
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's growing all the time there's
 
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
probably one or two people here who
 
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
remember back when there were something
 
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
like two unions as opposed to 14.
 
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
um probably not not that many people
 
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
here who remember that but the key rsas
 
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
in case anyone wants to look at them RSA
 
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
21i which is the admin Services RSA
 
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
section 42 talks about division of
 
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
personnel establishing a job
 
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 align:start position:0%
classification system
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
273a is a public Labor Relations law uh
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining law which dates to
 
00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
1975 as some I think some people know
 
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
about what's uh what's bargained
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
and then there's some Provisions in RSA
 
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
99 about the adjustments of salaries is
 
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
primarily about classified positions on
 
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
classifying their governed in a slightly
 
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
different way
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
turning to page four I want to talk
 
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
about collective bargaining agreements
 
00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of collective
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements there are 14
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
different collective bargaining
 
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
agreements the unions are bargained with
 
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
both together and separately and to give
 
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
you an a sense of the balkanization of
 
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
I think when I started there were nine
 
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
and now there are 14 and you know I
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly the time frame but go
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
back maybe 10 years number four go back
 
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
20 years and there were two or three
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
um it's not just the sca it's a whole
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
bunch of different unions so today the
 
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
governor and the 14 unions have
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
tentatively agreed to an across the
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
board 10 Cola with uh two percent uh the
 
00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 align:start position:0%
year after and there are other
 
00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 align:start position:0%
provisions of that agreement but those
 
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
are the two that I think you're most
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
interested in talking about there have
 
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
been some discussion about can the
 
00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
legislature change the negotiated Union
 
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
contracts the answer that is no
 
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
um and I have a little thumbs up and
 
00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
thumbs down here to say that your your
 
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 align:start position:0%
role is functionally to say yes or no
 
00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:16.139 align:start position:0%
you funded or you don't fund it so to
 
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
speak it's a it's an agreement between
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
the governor on one hand and the unions
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
on the other I had a question about the
 
00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:24.419 align:start position:0%
joint committee on employee relations
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
which I was on years ago and as far as I
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
know I've talked with people that should
 
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
have been on it last December when this
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
some of this negotiation was going on I
 
00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:37.259 align:start position:0%
don't believe that committee has met on
 
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
this contract I'm not I'm not aware that
 
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.469 align:start position:0%
they have
um

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
and I think I would be aware that they
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
had because the person who would have
 
00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
come brief you works for me so um
 
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
they have not and historically they
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
haven't the history of that history of
 
00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:54.419 align:start position:0%
that agreement is the legislature
 
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
involving itself in in the process and
 
00:07:59.809 --> 00:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
updating itself on what's going on in
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
theory telling the the bargaining team
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
the governor's bargaining team if you
 
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
will what uh what they wished would be
 
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
negotiated historically it's very rare
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
that that group has ever met
 
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.110 align:start position:0%
that that group has ever met
um

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
my experience was we met on it years ago
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
on some facet and all we were told at
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
the time was you can say yes or no
 
00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
and we said no then we negotiated and
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
took out the part we disliked
 
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
and we were happy that that sounds right
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm glad that I'm glad that
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's the committee that you ended up
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
happy as a result of That's So Rare
 
00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
these days
 
00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
um it's certainly not usually my
 
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
experience but um
 
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
that group is typically more involved in
 
00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:44.099 align:start position:0%
in years when the legislature and the
 
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
governor are in different parties for
 
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
example I think it was it was somewhat
 
00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:50.459 align:start position:0%
active when Governor Hassan was governor
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
in the legislature was a Republican and
 
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
it was somewhat active in in you know
 
00:08:58.009 --> 00:08:58.019 align:start position:0%
1920 when the reverse situation existed
 
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
Republican Governor Democratic
 
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
legislature well the experience was
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
after we had
 
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
exercised some control over the
 
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
over the budget
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
subsequently the Democrats removed the
 
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.269 align:start position:0%
subsequently the Democrats removed the
committee

00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
well I think it's come back and then
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
when the Republicans took over we
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
brought it back but as far as I know I
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
don't think it's met to get involved in
 
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
any of the negotiations since the
 
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
historic ups and downs I'd have to look
 
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
at they're often involved when there's a
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
fact-finding let's say that let's say
 
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
the unions and the governor don't reach
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
an agreement in our fact-finding reports
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
I know there were hearings in in
 
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say 2019 with regard to
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
fact finder reports and and that
 
00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
occasionally comes up so uh one of the
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
questions uh in related to the
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement is how much has
 
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
inflation eroded wages and yes we have
 
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
another question oh I'm sorry yes
 
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
hello good morning good to see you so on
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
page there's no page numbers the one
 
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
regarding collective bargaining
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
agreements right yes when you use the
 
00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
term tentatively agreed can you be more
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
explicit the
 
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.050 align:start position:0%
explicit the
um

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
the agreement between a governor and a
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
governor and a union is is uh you know
 
00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:11.339 align:start position:0%
sometimes hear the shorthand oeta that
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
and what what it means is that there's a
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
tentative agreement between the two
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
bodies um they write a formal they write
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
a formal document that document becomes
 
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
effective with the with the funding of
 
00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:25.019 align:start position:0%
the cost items
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
um by the legislature so so tentative
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
agreement is a is a is a term of Art in
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining and it just
 
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
suggests it's not effective the the
 
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
agreement is not effective until after
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
the sexual act yeah so
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
back to right definitions matter right
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
if there is a tentative agreement in
 
00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:47.459 align:start position:0%
place and the legislature doesn't fund
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
it does that then kick it back to a
 
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:51.180 align:start position:0%
review of that agreement just what
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
happens in a flowchart process wise
 
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
um if you don't fund the agreement is
 
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
rejected and collective bargaining would
 
00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
have to either begin again or be in hold
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
over status for two years thank you
 
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:04.100 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards has a question
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair you know I think the
 
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to always remain
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
Vigilant to and jealous of our power of
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
the purse and so in this third bullet
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
where you say we could either say yes or
 
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
no to the agreement it seems to me like
 
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
there's probably a third way I want to
 
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
run by you uh what what if we just said
 
00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:24.899 align:start position:0%
hey there's not enough money here's five
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
percent not ten percent and you don't
 
00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
have to use it for this if you don't
 
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
want to or not but but this is what
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to appropriate so
 
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
the um the the agreement a collective
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement is an agreement
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
between both parties on a multitude of a
 
00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:42.839 align:start position:0%
multitude of items and and the
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
bargaining team on it on the one hand
 
00:11:47.329 --> 00:11:47.339 align:start position:0%
um which is which is acting on behalf of
 
00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
the governor the governor signs and the
 
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:50.579 align:start position:0%
sca president signs for example on the
 
00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
sca contract
 
00:11:54.889 --> 00:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
is a contract on a on a multitude of
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
items and in theory uh I think legally
 
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
the items are are of a whole
 
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
um in theory someone would say you know
 
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
we we agreed to ten not nine or or we
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
agreed to 10 not 11 depending on your
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
perspective based on this and this and
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
this and if the whole package isn't
 
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
there then we would have to negotiate
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
the whole package so in terms of
 
00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
partially funding
 
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
um the the effect of partially funding
 
00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:23.459 align:start position:0%
would be to set aside money in the
 
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
budget to fund a future collective
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to partially fund this
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
agreement so this agreement in because
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
of lack of funding it's a discussion you
 
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
probably ought to also have with the
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
AG's office and I know the AG's office
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
has sent you a document
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
um on this but
 
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
um the collecting of uh the bargaining
 
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
agreement is done and has to be
 
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:50.339 align:start position:0%
renegotiated you would be on behalf of
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature saying this is the limit
 
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
with which we would fund which has
 
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
sometimes happened in the past if you
 
00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
decide to partially fund cost items in a
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
document one of the things I would
 
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
suggest is that we have a conversation
 
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
about that because in the you know for
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
for example one year a few years back
 
00:13:11.329 --> 00:13:11.339 align:start position:0%
the legislature partially funded only
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
the general fund portions of an
 
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
agreement which meant that if you were
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
an employee who was not generally funded
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
for example which is the most of our
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
employees Highway funded turnpike-funded
 
00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:26.339 align:start position:0%
partially federally funded I want to let
 
00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:28.019 align:start position:0%
you know you answered my question thank
 
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
so how much so why 10 and how much is
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
inflation eroded wages if you look at
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
page five
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
which oddly does have a page number as
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
opposed to four that's odd
 
00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:42.530 align:start position:0%
opposed to four that's odd
um

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
so uh historically the you know the cost
 
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:47.220 align:start position:0%
of living agreements have have typically
 
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
kept pace with wages and only not over
 
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
the last five years and I have I have
 
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
data here just to
 
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.170 align:start position:0%
data here just to
um

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
so I did the data once a long time ago
 
00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
to amuse myself because I this is what I
 
00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.990 align:start position:0%
to amuse myself because I this is what I
do

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
um and uh but if you look at it from 93
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
to 98 the cumulative colas and inflation
 
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:08.420 align:start position:0%
were roughly the same from 98 to 2018
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
and those are picked because they're
 
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
round number periods it's about the same
 
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
if you want to look at 15 years instead
 
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
of 10 they're about the same we kept up
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
historically the state has kept up
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
inflation has been difficult over the
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
last five years as people are aware in a
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
lot of areas and so while inflation has
 
00:14:29.449 --> 00:14:29.459 align:start position:0%
been about 20 percent uh coal is have
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
been above five and I think that's
 
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
um probably not speaking for the
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
bargaining committee the source of those
 
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
numbers with with a 10 and a two we will
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
we will not quite but almost catch up
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
with inflation but not quite
 
00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
so that's the bargaining agreements
 
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
question representative McGuire thank
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you commissioner
 
00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:56.459 align:start position:0%
um is your inflation column CPI
 
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
inflation yes I'm sorry it's CPI thank
 
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.290 align:start position:0%
inflation yes I'm sorry it's CPI thank
you

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
it's um it's CPI downloaded from the BLS
 
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
website non-seasonably adjusted if
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
you're if you really want to try to
 
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.829 align:start position:0%
you're if you really want to try to
replicate

00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
replicate
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
but I can send you the table follow up
 
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
yeah I discovered fairly recently
 
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
looking at much longer terms that
 
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
inflation in wages is quite different
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
than inflation in things and so it's
 
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
possible that CPI is not the appropriate
 
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.470 align:start position:0%
possible that CPI is not the appropriate
comparison

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
thank you I think there are multiple
 
00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
things to use but historically the
 
00:15:35.689 --> 00:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
when it's discussed in bargaining I
 
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
think they use CPI because it's a
 
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
measure of what theoretically the wages
 
00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:41.579 align:start position:0%
can buy
 
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
and if you've been to Market Basket
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
lately which is a wonderful store but um
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
their prices seem to be going up
 
00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.490 align:start position:0%
their prices seem to be going up
so

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
that's a thing okay
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
if there are no other questions on that
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
the executive branch job classification
 
00:15:58.079 --> 00:16:00.110 align:start position:0%
the executive branch job classification
system

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
um what is a job classification system a
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
job classification system is designed to
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
provide an objective and Equitable
 
00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
process to group job duties and
 
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
responsibilities it's just a definition
 
00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:11.420 align:start position:0%
I think people sort of understand that
 
00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:14.459 align:start position:0%
large employers uh almost all public
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
entities and almost uh and most large
 
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
employers depending on the size use some
 
00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:21.860 align:start position:0%
sort of a classification system
 
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
to to allocate jobs and the ideas is
 
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
Broad Equity
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
a classification system is meant to
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
promote parity and titles and
 
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to have consistent job
 
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
levels and then salary ranges that are
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
determined by identified rating factors
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
I happen to list here what our current
 
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
system identifies as rating factors
 
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
know-how scope and effect complexity
 
00:16:46.449 --> 00:16:46.459 align:start position:0%
work environment communication
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
independent action this is something
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
rating factors is something we've used
 
00:16:52.329 --> 00:16:52.339 align:start position:0%
since 19
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
1950 when the when the three disparate
 
00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
systems were merged into one in in sherm
 
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
Adamsville if you will and it's
 
00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:03.899 align:start position:0%
something that I think this dates back
 
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia Rapid Transit company in
 
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
the 1890s if you really want to look it
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
up but that but that's the point we have
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
a system where every job in the state is
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
allocated and is placed in a spot in a
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
giant grid our grid happens to have 35
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
labor grades and nine steps when
 
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
everything is plopped somewhere under
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
the grid when you look at your job and
 
00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
say what do you do exactly okay this and
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
this and and in order to make a
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
comparative assessment rather than
 
00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.510 align:start position:0%
comparative assessment rather than
saying

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
um well geez I like him so why don't we
 
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
make him a labor grade 16 and you not so
 
00:17:39.409 --> 00:17:39.419 align:start position:0%
much so you're a 12. um we look at it
 
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
and say what's the position what are the
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
duties and how do and we uh and we uh
 
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
Factor them in and it produces a number
 
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
that comes out of
 
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
this is similar to how um
 
00:17:54.529 --> 00:17:54.539 align:start position:0%
unclassified jobs are measured by the
 
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
hey now corn fairy group through the
 
00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
jcec process
 
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
so reforming the classification system
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
there are a couple things to say I mean
 
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
first of all the fact that reform is
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
necessary is something people talked
 
00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:09.299 align:start position:0%
about for 50 years right and and those
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
of you who've been around for a couple
 
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
of years will remember the mid 90s there
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
was a winter commission which was a
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
National Group
 
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
I think headed by the former Governor
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
Moses's Mississippi or Missouri
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
something that begins with Miss
 
00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
um and uh around the same time there was
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
an Al Gore had a reforming federal
 
00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
government kind of commission at the
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
same time
 
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things a lot of things
 
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
they identified then and we're looking
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
at now I want to start by saying it's
 
00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
budget neutral and we say this all the
 
00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:42.020 align:start position:0%
time both to assure managers and assure
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
budgeteers and assure employees
 
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
everybody will be mapped somewhere in
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
the new system nobody's salary will go
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
up or go down as a result of this
 
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
everybody will be placed in a new
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
position but there aren't going to be
 
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
quote unquote winners and losers as part
 
00:18:58.970 --> 00:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
of the process it's an important part of
 
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
Reform that you have to start with that
 
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
everybody is mapped from a current
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
position to a new place in a new system
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
there are a handful of
 
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.190 align:start position:0%
there are a handful of
um

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
principles that we're trying to use in
 
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
the system one is simplification our
 
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
system is very complex people have
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
talked for for at least 30 years about
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
the enormous number of job
 
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
classifications job classification is is
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
the thing administrator two attorney
 
00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:26.690 align:start position:0%
the thing administrator two attorney
four

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
Etc and there there are 1400 and we're
 
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
transitioning from 1400 to 200 we've
 
00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:33.980 align:start position:0%
actually done this this transition
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
grouped in 22 major occupational groups
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
um so we're we're simplifying the system
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
to make it easier to understand for
 
00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:44.059 align:start position:0%
everybody inside and outside
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
standardization our system is New
 
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific everything is New
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific we used to have a job
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
title called administrator to the
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
Personnel appeals board there are lots
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
of those everywhere in the country
 
00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
because we have a Personnel appeals
 
00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:00.539 align:start position:0%
board other people don't
 
00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:03.299 align:start position:0%
um so we're using nationally Norm groups
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
the national standards that are done
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
routinely and regularly by the by the
 
00:20:09.169 --> 00:20:09.179 align:start position:0%
feds are called standard occupational
 
00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
classifications you'll sometimes hear
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
people talk about sock
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the advantage of the Sox is that
 
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
they link to publicly available and
 
00:20:21.049 --> 00:20:21.059 align:start position:0%
regularly updated employment data
 
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
um things about positions things about
 
00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:25.160 align:start position:0%
vacancies things about
 
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
compensation so that there is publicly
 
00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:30.299 align:start position:0%
available data we link to because we use
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
nationally normed nationally
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
standardized things we can link to them
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have to guess one of the things
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
people know is that every time the state
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
does a classification study which you
 
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
know most recently we did based on the
 
00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
2019 system we spend an enormous amount
 
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
of time hiring a consultant to look at
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
things and say who do we compare this
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
person to who do we compare this person
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
to and and how does that look like we'll
 
00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
have nationally Norm data that does that
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
for us
 
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
analysis I talked before about how we do
 
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
a factor analysis to rate positions one
 
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
of the things that we don't do we do our
 
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299 align:start position:0%
ratings on the basis of job content and
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
job content alone
 
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
something like 80 percent of uh groups
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
that do classification use a combination
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
of compensation and job content and the
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
easiest way to describe this is with
 
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
nurses you look at nurses based on
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
jobcon and you're like you do this and
 
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
you do this and you do this and you do
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
that and it factors out in your labor
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
grade 18. but
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
there's no earthly way to hire anybody
 
00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
at that salary because that's not what
 
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
nurses make that may be what the job
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
content proposes but it's not what they
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
make and so this what we're proposing is
 
00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
adding a compensation factor to other
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
job content which is to say that we
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
um we analyze based on what it would
 
00:21:54.649 --> 00:21:54.659 align:start position:0%
actually cost to hire people who do that
 
00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
for a living and so it would be one of
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
question representative papovichi Miller
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
taking the questions
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
um I was going to ask when you started
 
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
talking about the budget neutral but
 
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
then I saw the you know this point on
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
the slide a bit later and I figured it
 
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
fits better here you are saying that
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
right now with the remapping no employee
 
00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:22.700 align:start position:0%
salary will change completely understood
 
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
but obviously based on the changes in
 
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
here we would expect changings in
 
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
compensation to occur over the long term
 
00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
because we would have better data in the
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
different classifications to adjust
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
somebody may come in with their current
 
00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:39.299 align:start position:0%
salary and be at the high end or at the
 
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
low end of a range so they would either
 
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
move up more slowly or faster depending
 
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
on where they are in the new range and
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
so on would it be fair to say that while
 
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
right now it's budget neutral this
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
reclassification will change you know
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
compensations over the long term and
 
00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
that's really part of the you know
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
design goals it um it could I want to I
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
want to clarify exactly how though
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
because I think it's important in the
 
00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
current in the current system when when
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
people think that a classification is
 
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
inappropriate on the basis of
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
recruitment or retention our ability to
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
hire people that salary we do what's
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
called an enhancement to that
 
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
classification not to an individual
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
position but to entire class of
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
positions and so what happens is those
 
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
items are are done through I mean it's a
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
process and the governor's office looks
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
at them and division of personnel looks
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
at them in the end they go to governor
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
and Council we currently have something
 
00:23:36.049 --> 00:23:36.059 align:start position:0%
like 1400 positions across government
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
where there's an enhancement and it's
 
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
done for this process of enhancement
 
00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
what we're proposing doing here is is
 
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
formalizing in the system so there
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
aren't 1400 one-offs it's hard to
 
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
describe something as a one-off when
 
00:23:51.409 --> 00:23:51.419 align:start position:0%
there are 1400 of them
 
00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's clearly a flaw for how
 
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
you address that not a flaw but a
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
presumption is that they would be very
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
rare and they're not very rare so we
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
would do that in addition to that in our
 
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
current system there are two other ways
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
in which the um
 
00:24:09.529 --> 00:24:09.539 align:start position:0%
uh the place a position is slotted
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
happens is it a labor grade 12 is it a
 
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
labor grade 26 and how does that work
 
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
um if an employee or a or a or a
 
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner or somebody manager
 
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
um thinks that uh an employee is not
 
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
appropriately classified or a group they
 
00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:27.059 align:start position:0%
can ask for a reclassification I can
 
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
look and I say you know based on what
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
Cassie does you know we have her
 
00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:33.299 align:start position:0%
classified as an attorney too it's not
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
actually what she does she's more like
 
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:36.539 align:start position:0%
an administrator for based on this this
 
00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:39.539 align:start position:0%
and this and we would look at that
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's done often with vacant positions
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
and it's done less frequently with
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
filled positions but we would look at it
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
and uh there's a review process and we
 
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
would decide that position is is not
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately classified and it should
 
00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:54.419 align:start position:0%
be it should be X not Y in addition to
 
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
that you can do that with an entire
 
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
group of positions uh an entire
 
00:25:00.409 --> 00:25:00.419 align:start position:0%
classification of positions all like
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
positions across government that's
 
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
currently called a reallocation where
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
you might look at recently for example
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
people are familiar with this we did
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
this with state troopers where state
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
troopers believed based on a variety of
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
reasons that they were not appropriately
 
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
accounted for and there's a lot of
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
paperwork involved but it's on this
 
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
anticipates doing a lot of that work
 
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
similarly but doing it more explicitly
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
as part of a factor analysis rather than
 
00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
separately thank you I just wanted to
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the high quality and you
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
know you know how much we like getting
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
in the weeds when needed it's it was a
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
good time to do so well I've tried once
 
00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:37.580 align:start position:0%
in a while
 
00:25:39.649 --> 00:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
yeah the only other thing I was going to
 
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
add to it as the commissioner was
 
00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.299 align:start position:0%
talking about when we have these today
 
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
and I think this is a really important
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
um item to to notice is that agencies
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
today if they ask for a reallocation of
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
a group of positions or reality or
 
00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
reallocation of just one they still need
 
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
to fund it within their existing budget
 
00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
so when you talk about you know over the
 
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
long term can things not be budget
 
00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
neutral we have a process today for pay
 
00:26:05.049 --> 00:26:05.059 align:start position:0%
to change for a group or an individual
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
agencies still have to manage within the
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
budget that's given to them so how do
 
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
they fund it through vacancies or other
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
things that have changed but it's not
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
that there's an additional appropriation
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
that comes to them to manage that thank
 
00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:17.930 align:start position:0%
that comes to them to manage that thank
you

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
you have further questions
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative hole thank you two
 
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.190 align:start position:0%
representative hole thank you two
questions

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
in the reallocation right for a single
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
position right who is that review
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
process going before uh there's a
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
there's a a unit at the division of
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
personnel okay and then follow-up we
 
00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:36.649 align:start position:0%
personnel okay and then follow-up we
have

00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
um a large number of positions that are
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
hourly versus salaried within the state
 
00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:42.070 align:start position:0%
hourly versus salaried within the state
for

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
all of them men and well there's us
 
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
within DHHS one percent or something is
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
half a percent is is salaried versus
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
the balance that are hourly
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
is there has there been any
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
investigation into like managerial and
 
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
higher level people being salaried
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
versus hourly there's
 
00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:05.690 align:start position:0%
versus hourly there's
um

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
this gets a little too in the in the
 
00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:09.299 align:start position:0%
Weeds on this people will remember that
 
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
in in something like 2015 don't hold me
 
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
till that year
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
um there was a look the federal labor
 
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
department looked at some of the way we
 
00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
paid people and did things we ended up
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
engaging a company called littler that's
 
00:27:24.169 --> 00:27:24.179 align:start position:0%
very prominent in employment law to do
 
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
on to do a comprehensive audit uh an
 
00:27:30.289 --> 00:27:30.299 align:start position:0%
audit that I think only doj has a copy
 
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
of and it's thousands of pages to talk
 
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
about whether some of the things we did
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
are appropriate or inappropriate and if
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
you uh compared to the federal flsa law
 
00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:42.059 align:start position:0%
and in particular as it surrounds exempt
 
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
to non-exempt employees and whether the
 
00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:45.419 align:start position:0%
state is one employer or not one
 
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
employer can you work can you work a
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
second job within the state without it
 
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
with it not counting as overtime the
 
00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:54.299 align:start position:0%
answer is no you can't
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:27:57.289 --> 00:27:57.299 align:start position:0%
um and we had thought the answer before
 
00:27:59.390 --> 00:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
was yes apparently
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
um so that so some of it so that some of
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
that happens
 
00:28:06.649 --> 00:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
um we've we have considered in fact our
 
00:28:09.409 --> 00:28:09.419 align:start position:0%
director of personnel for example has a
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
has a has a thought on how to create a
 
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
group of non-exempt
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh salary salaried classified if you
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
will positions still eligible to join
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
the union still eligible to
 
00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:24.299 align:start position:0%
um to be a classified employee but who
 
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
would be functionally salaried and not
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
on salary it's a significant change and
 
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
we've had very preliminary discussions
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
with the governor about it
 
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
um and I I think of it as sort of a
 
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
second part of the classification reform
 
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
I would like to get there because it
 
00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
you have a you have an accountant making
 
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
a hundred and six thousand dollars a
 
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
year it's a little goofy that they're a
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
uh that they're an hourly employee or
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
that they're paid as if they're an
 
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire for a question
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner you said there were nine
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
steps and I'd like to learn a little
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
more about those does someone in a new
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
job always start at step one are the
 
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
differences from step one to step two
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
always X percent the same across all
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
classifications things like that there's
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
a grid I can actually refer you to the
 
00:29:18.169 --> 00:29:18.179 align:start position:0%
the pay schedules are all published on
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
on our website and uh and for the most
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
part in the collective bargaining
 
00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:24.419 align:start position:0%
agreements I think there may be some
 
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
that are not
 
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
um functionally the grid has
 
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.490 align:start position:0%
um functionally the grid has
um

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:30.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:33.299 align:start position:0%
so there let me let me start a couple
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
things about the grid the grid has
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
diagonal Equity so step two of the labor
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
grade below is the same as step one of
 
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:41.940 align:start position:0%
the labor grid above and then you
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
diagonally progress so it's and it's
 
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
about four percent roughly in in terms
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
of a grid it's not precisely four
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
percent I think some of that is over
 
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
time but generally speaking like if you
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
draw a diagonal line you can see forty
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
two thousand six hundred twelve forty
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
thousand six hundred twelve Etc and it's
 
00:29:59.810 --> 00:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
why when someone is promoted in the
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
system they there's a diagonal path that
 
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
they take you go you go diagonally to
 
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
their new salary and then up one to to
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
to get them where they were how do
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
people start is a good question in
 
00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.130 align:start position:0%
people start is a good question in
theory

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
theory
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
in theory you're meant to start at step
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
one work your career and and at the end
 
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
of I think it's 12 years that it would
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
take you to progress all nine steps the
 
00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:24.299 align:start position:0%
early steps are one year and the later
 
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
steps are two years and the final step
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
is three years
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
um and in theory that's how it would
 
00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
work that that presumes a world in which
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
people take a job and stay in the same
 
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
company for a very very very long time
 
00:30:39.049 --> 00:30:39.059 align:start position:0%
it's not actually the world we live in
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
anymore you know my dad worked for
 
00:30:42.889 --> 00:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
General Motors for 40 years
 
00:30:45.169 --> 00:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
um uh it's unlikely I'm gonna work for
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
anybody for 40 years unless I stay in
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
this job until I'm 100 which seems
 
00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:51.169 align:start position:0%
this job until I'm 100 which seems
unlikely

00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
unlikely
 
00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
um be hard to get reappointed I think at
 
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.010 align:start position:0%
um be hard to get reappointed I think at
96.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
96.
 
00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
and it depends on the climate right in
 
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
in some when the labor market is is
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
quite loose
 
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:04.730 align:start position:0%
quite loose
um

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
it's much easier for us to hire
 
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
everybody who applies to Step One when
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
the labor market is very tight like it
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
is today the hopes of attracting anybody
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
and frankly because of where wages are
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
the hopes of attracting anybody Step One
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
is difficult I want to hire somebody in
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
there you know you you already make more
 
00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
than I could hire you with at step five
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
so there's a process where you request a
 
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
waiver for hiring at a higher step
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you so so the the the
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
ten and two percent colas here are
 
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
supplemented by annual step increases of
 
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
roughly four percent is that right
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
yes uh although later in your career
 
00:31:45.889 --> 00:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
it's two years or the final year three
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
years and of course your step nine
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
you're just out of luck
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
and I think the theory behind the two
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
different things the one is for
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh longevity and experience than the
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
others for the cost of living as I think
 
00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.010 align:start position:0%
others for the cost of living as I think
the

00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
a houseman explained to me in the past
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
how much effect is there on span of
 
00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
control one person supervises three and
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
other supervises ten
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
does that make a difference if you um if
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
you think about the the rating factors
 
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
and I mentioned earlier what some of the
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
rating factors are the the idea behind
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
that is to get a job complexity when I
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
say job content a big piece of that is
 
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
complexity and it's it's your impact on
 
00:32:24.649 --> 00:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
other employees and your impact on the
 
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
state Enterprise as a whole and so there
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
there are ways to look at that and it's
 
00:32:30.529 --> 00:32:30.539 align:start position:0%
why you know we we come up with Point
 
00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:32.220 align:start position:0%
totals but there's a subjective quality
 
00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
to it in in theory somebody who
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
supervises 10 people is likely going to
 
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
have a higher score on that ranking than
 
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
somebody who supervises three
 
00:32:45.649 --> 00:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
um I I don't say that there aren't cases
 
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
where the person who supervises three
 
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:49.980 align:start position:0%
has a higher rating because of what he
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
or she is also doing but um but in
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
theory 10 is likely to yield you more
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
points if you will than three how did
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
the national standards evolve
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
I hope that's not from the feds well um
 
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
they it they did evolve from the feds
 
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
and if I mean if you look back at the
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
way the federal government works
 
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.430 align:start position:0%
way the federal government works
um

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
I mean frankly when we uh when we
 
00:33:15.409 --> 00:33:15.419 align:start position:0%
developed our system in 1950 there was a
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
lot of work done we had a consultant I
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
think from New Jersey
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
um who was who was very active in the
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
Council on state governments who had
 
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
developed model legislation and
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
classification reform you know
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
classification reform you know I said
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
the thing about Garfield getting killed
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
right by a disgruntled job seeker and um
 
00:33:36.049 --> 00:33:36.059 align:start position:0%
and it's what led to you know uh
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
President Arthur imposing a a civil
 
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
service system and then it was the
 
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
Social Security amendments in the 30s
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
Governor Murphy here at the time who
 
00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:48.539 align:start position:0%
imposed a classification system but in
 
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
1950 that you know there's a lot of work
 
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
because most states were adopting them
 
00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:54.539 align:start position:0%
in the 30s and 40s and they wanted to do
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
something much more scientific if you
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
look at that legislation there are all
 
00:33:59.470 --> 00:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
kinds of charts in it and all of that
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
the same thing happened federally and
 
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
they did a lot of work there have been
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
three or four periods of significant
 
00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
Personnel reform at the federal level
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
one was during the Reagan Administration
 
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
when when when Don Devine was director
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
of the office of personnel management
 
00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
one was during the Clinton
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
Administration when when Al Gore had a
 
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
had a commission which I think was
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
called something like Reinventing
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
government and the the
 
00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:25.379 align:start position:0%
um whether you think
 
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
Al Gore is more Progressive than you
 
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
would wish or more conservative than you
 
00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
would wish there's a lot of really good
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
data in in that many hundreds of pages
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
of report so they come out of that and
 
00:34:39.609 --> 00:34:39.619 align:start position:0%
one of the ideas was to create a system
 
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
of of measuring things and it's uh it's
 
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
both sock and then the onet database
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
which which helps tell if it's doing a
 
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
good job so it did it did come out of
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
the feds but after significant reform
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
you certainly study history
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
I uh I'm trying to learn my job well
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's my goal it's not working every day
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
um on decisions I'll just close on this
 
00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.130 align:start position:0%
um on decisions I'll just close on this
slide

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
um our idea that has is to have more
 
00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:10.700 align:start position:0%
information to make more decisions
 
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
exactly what that means
 
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
um doesn't mean anything will
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily be adjusted and it doesn't
 
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
mean just because we think you know it's
 
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
possible we'll find that the entire
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
state is eight and a half percent Below
 
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
on average below and what some states
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
that have done things like this
 
00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:29.339 align:start position:0%
um they'll have like an auditor or
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
someone like that do a list of positions
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
that are particularly anomalous and and
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
work with either the legislature or some
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
other mechanism to to reform them
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
so it's it's information with which to
 
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
make decisions
 
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.550 align:start position:0%
make decisions
okay

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
moving on to recruitment and retention
 
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:47.390 align:start position:0%
moving on to recruitment and retention
um

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
this is a big challenge for everybody
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
here right representative Edwards has a
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
question oh sure uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Arlington I I just want
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
to make sure that my big Epiphany during
 
00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:02.579 align:start position:0%
this briefing is accurate that that
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
we're sort of burying the lead a little
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
bit because people keep talking about
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
the 10 percent the two percent because
 
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
the money is so important but it seems
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
like slide seven under simplification
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
this is really the headline of what's
 
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
going on we have massive
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
um transition and reform of our personal
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
classification system that's in that's
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
in what all of this is an hp2 the the
 
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.589 align:start position:0%
in what all of this is an hp2 the the
transition

00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
transition
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
most of it isn't an hb2 most of it is
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
um if you think of governance the uh the
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
division of personnel is tasked with
 
00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:40.700 align:start position:0%
doing with doing a classification system
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
okay so you have the authority to redo
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
the classification system without an
 
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:47.579 align:start position:0%
additional legislation and you're
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
currently undergoing a massive amount of
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
reclassification work is that accurate
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
um if it were not budget neutral we
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
would have a significant
 
00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
we would have to interact significantly
 
00:37:05.569 --> 00:37:05.579 align:start position:0%
with the with the house bill one and
 
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
um but that's a piece of it recruitment
 
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
and retention
 
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
which um so we talked about the 10 which
 
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
is a big part of Recruitment and
 
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:17.700 align:start position:0%
Retention but um it's worth worthwhile
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
saying as a preface that in the past the
 
00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
state was a destination employer Sherry
 
00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:23.339 align:start position:0%
came up with that phrase which I think
 
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
is which I think is right
 
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
um a number of employees who are um I
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
was going to say who are older than I am
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
but including some who are younger than
 
00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
I am because I appear to be aging
 
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
um well say you hear people talk all the
 
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
time my goal was to get into the state
 
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
system and you know my my father always
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
told me that that that's where you need
 
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
to do you need to try to get into the
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
state system and so it's a good place to
 
00:37:46.849 --> 00:37:46.859 align:start position:0%
be and and it's been like that for a
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
long time and there are a number of
 
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
employees who want to who want to work
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
here want to both start and end their
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
career here
 
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
um but it's there are fewer and far
 
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
between times really have changed people
 
00:37:59.569 --> 00:37:59.579 align:start position:0%
don't work at General Motors for 50
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
years people don't work in a lot of
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
places for 50 years
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
what we have to do is continually
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
realign our policies to actively draw
 
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
candidates to the state it's what we
 
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
look at and it's what we do how do we
 
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:16.140 align:start position:0%
attract talent to the state the state is
 
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
the state is not just an employer it's
 
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
not just somebody who has people on
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
payroll it's it the state has lots and
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
lots of people on payroll doing
 
00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
um doing enormous things that the entire
 
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
working for the people of the State of
 
00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that they rely on and and
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work and there's a lot
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
of interaction with with with lawmakers
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
and other policy makers to ensure that
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
things happen that ensure that things
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
happen in a transparent way to ensure
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
that that policies are being followed
 
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a privilege but an enormous
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility and
 
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
um and to do that we have to we have to
 
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
attract good talent to the state I think
 
00:38:57.609 --> 00:38:57.619 align:start position:0%
you know this committee more than most
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
sees the results of that when um when we
 
00:39:02.329 --> 00:39:02.339 align:start position:0%
have good people very good things happen
 
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
when we don't they don't so there are a
 
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
lot of things that we do and so
 
00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.390 align:start position:0%
lot of things that we do and so
um

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
the first thing I'm going to mention is
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
my favorite thing because this is my
 
00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
idea and I fought very hard for this
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
which is to eliminate the the barrier
 
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
dismissed by degrees as the academic
 
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
research on this where you create
 
00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
artificial employment barriers to to
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
um well to hire you you create oh if you
 
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
have a degree if you don't have a ba you
 
00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
can't possibly have this job I don't
 
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
care if you have 20 years of experience
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
you didn't actually complete your you
 
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
complete your degree so we allow
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
experience and education to be to be
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
supplemented with each other this is a
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
significant reform that I think other
 
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
states are now following as well we're
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
very very happy about this and and it
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
allows us to attract Talent we might not
 
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
otherwise have been able to talent and
 
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
to to attract and to Reign repay retain
 
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
people we might not otherwise be able to
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
retain based upon their ability to do
 
00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:02.579 align:start position:0%
the job as opposed to having having
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
taken the requisite number of English
 
00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
literature courses
 
00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:11.220 align:start position:0%
um we're we uh we see increasing use of
 
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
promotional pass I think the new system
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
will allow for more proportional paths
 
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
and one way to think about this is this
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
we have something like 66 different
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
promotional paths in state government
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
right now but think of it as a as a bank
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
examiner Bank examiner one two three
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
four somebody gets better and better at
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
their job and they rise in in that in
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
that path they're promoted within their
 
00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.089 align:start position:0%
that path they're promoted within their
position

00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:35.099 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
um they gain the experience to do a
 
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
better job and they don't have to leave
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
to increase their compensation they can
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
stay here and do so we established a
 
00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
Statewide recruitment unit which is arpa
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
funded but to consult with and assist
 
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
every agency to identify obstacles and
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
help agencies and hiring managers
 
00:40:53.089 --> 00:40:53.099 align:start position:0%
improve hiring practices one of the
 
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
obstacles in hiring is that hiring
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
managers are managers they're not hiring
 
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
managers they weren't trained we didn't
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
hire them because of their ability to
 
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
hire we hired them because of their
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
ability as an accountant as an engineer
 
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
as an attorney as an administrator and
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
yet they're also being asked to do
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
hiring which is any manager would tell
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
you the biggest obstacle is hiring to
 
00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
hiring is that I have to do my job and
 
00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:19.619 align:start position:0%
hire on the side and so what we've done
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
is try to identify best practices and
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
improve things and look at things you've
 
00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
got 162 people who've waited more than
 
00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:29.099 align:start position:0%
30 days to be contacted after they've
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
applied for the job that's not working
 
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
in this climate none of those people are
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
going to work for you because they all
 
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
took another job already and so we work
 
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
with them and identify as ways ways to
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
do that I think that's going very well
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
um we're going to enhance the state's
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
online presence for recruitment we've
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
done some of this in the past
 
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
particularly with indeed but there are a
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
bunch of things some of which I am very
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with some of which I'm not I
 
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
never heard of handshake before but
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
apparently people who look for work have
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
heard of handshake before and know a
 
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
great deal about it
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
um and the idea is to go to people where
 
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
they are not the old-fashioned State
 
00:42:08.089 --> 00:42:08.099 align:start position:0%
Methodist that you put if you posted
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
they will come
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
you post a job people come see it that's
 
00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
just not how it works and then they're
 
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
the arpa funded Recruitment and
 
00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:17.339 align:start position:0%
Retention incentives which which I think
 
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
for the agencies that received them were
 
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
found to be beneficial I would hasten to
 
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
add though that very very few people
 
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
um in the
 
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
percentage basis had access to those
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
um retention bonuses so it didn't
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily affect them
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
Christian representative Campbells thank
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair do you promote the quality
 
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
of life in New Hampshire to do you have
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
programs like that to try to get people
 
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
from out of state to come here I I don't
 
00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
want to say that we have a formal
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
promotion of the quality of life program
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
it's not like it's not like it's a
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
separate thing but I think that when
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
we're recruiting candidates
 
00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.069 align:start position:0%
we're recruiting candidates
um

00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
we talk about it a lot and I use as an
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
example like this committee knows that
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
that for our department I do a final
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
interview on everybody we hire and it's
 
00:43:07.849 --> 00:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
um you know more than 100 people a year
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
and I would say about half of them are
 
00:43:14.329 --> 00:43:14.339 align:start position:0%
from are were born in New Hampshire and
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
half of them came to New Hampshire from
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere else including me
 
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
the quality of life in New Hampshire is
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
an enormous attraction to a job here and
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
it and you know I don't want to I don't
 
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
want to second-guess that that's a
 
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
that's a big thing I think New Hampshire
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
itself is a great place to go and we
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
want people who have decided to go here
 
00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
um to also want to work for the state as
 
00:43:40.319 --> 00:43:41.930 align:start position:0%
um to also want to work for the state as
well

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
we have further questions one from
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner then one from
 
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
representative emmerich
 
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
uh could you talk a little bit about the
 
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
arpa incentives that we were able to
 
00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.950 align:start position:0%
arpa incentives that we were able to
give

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
give
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
specifically around what types of jobs
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
um received those incentives and sort of
 
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
what the range of the incentives were
 
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
um Sherry actually has a list which
 
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
thank God because I didn't bring one
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
with me
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
um but it's I want to as a big picture
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
item they tended to be mostly jobs at 24
 
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
7 facilities if you think of Corrections
 
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
Veterans Home New Hampshire hospital Etc
 
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
and not for
 
00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:21.890 align:start position:0%
and not for
um

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
for the most part not for
 
00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:25.490 align:start position:0%
for the most part not for
um

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
most employees do you want to hit what
 
00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
they are sure so I can provide more
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
detail because I do have a pretty good
 
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
handout that has information on it but
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
just to give you a sense of a few things
 
00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
one of the early on incentive programs
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
um as the commissioner mentioned was
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
Direct Care institutional so think of
 
00:44:46.569 --> 00:44:46.579 align:start position:0%
Veterans Home
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
safety Corrections New Hampshire
 
00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
hospital glencliffe a lot of that was if
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
you work directly with clients or I
 
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
should say with with patients or
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
residents that was a two thousand dollar
 
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
one-time payment for full-time part-time
 
00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
was 500 there was some parameters in
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
terms of timing in terms of number of
 
00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:08.579 align:start position:0%
them we can send the committee uh Sherry
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
as a summary sheet which we can share
 
00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
with the committee so just to give you
 
00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:13.140 align:start position:0%
some some ranges so that you know around
 
00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
1300 individuals receive that then we
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
had anything from and I think of that
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
more as retention you had a it's an
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
existing employee but then there was
 
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
also ones that were
 
00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
um I'll call them signing bonuses to try
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
to attract a new hire so Corrections on
 
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
correctional officers and Troopers so
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
think of sworn officers in both of those
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
agencies they had ten thousand dollar
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
signing bonuses
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
that was um not as large of numbers
 
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
there was around 15 new hires in each of
 
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:42.770 align:start position:0%
there was around 15 new hires in each of
those

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
so a smaller category there also for
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
safety and Corrections you had a a bonus
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
somebody pick up the flag
 
00:46:00.599 --> 00:46:02.270 align:start position:0%
somebody pick up the flag
um

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:05.339 align:start position:0%
okay hang on my eyesight isn't what it
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
once was uh employee retention
 
00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
incentives at the veterans some for
 
00:46:10.849 --> 00:46:10.859 align:start position:0%
non-direct care workers one-time payment
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
safety retention incentives to full-time
 
00:46:17.809 --> 00:46:17.819 align:start position:0%
State and police fire and safety sworn
 
00:46:17.819 --> 00:46:18.950 align:start position:0%
State and police fire and safety sworn
personnel

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
safety recruitment incentive to new
 
00:46:21.359 --> 00:46:22.550 align:start position:0%
safety recruitment incentive to new
full-time

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
State personnel
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
the retention was five thousand the new
 
00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
is ten thousand Corrections retention
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
incentives to existing full-time sworn
 
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
correction Personnel five thousand
 
00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
Corrections recruitment incentives to
 
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
new full-time sworn Correctional
 
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
Personnel ten thousand
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then Transportation had a had a
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance thing if you agreed
 
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:45.770 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance thing if you agreed
to

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
uh be part of the winter maintenance
 
00:46:50.809 --> 00:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
on call for that um it's twenty five
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars which I gather
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
was very helpful for them in the winter
 
00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
so that's the big stuff what period do
 
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
you have to work to qualify for the sign
 
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
in bonus I mean you can't sign in get
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
the bonus and leave in six months no but
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
I think it was six months it wasn't it
 
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
wasn't you just get it but I think it's
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
six months that you had to stay I can
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:24.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
I think we lost Sherry
 
00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:29.339 align:start position:0%
he canceled his question
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
oh good okay
 
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards has one
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I want to come back to
 
00:47:41.809 --> 00:47:41.819 align:start position:0%
representative hole's question
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the things that
 
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:46.140 align:start position:0%
triggered division three wanting to have
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
this conversation with you it was the
 
00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:51.079 align:start position:0%
observation that
 
00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
DHHS only has two percent three percent
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
of their total Workforce in a salaried
 
00:47:58.560 --> 00:47:59.690 align:start position:0%
of their total Workforce in a salaried
position

00:47:59.690 --> 00:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
and that just seems odd given everyone's
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
experience with the commercial corporate
 
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
world that's a very very very low
 
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
percentage and I know you answered this
 
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
in part but what I was looking to hear
 
00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.569 align:start position:0%
in part but what I was looking to hear
is

00:48:14.569 --> 00:48:14.579 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
um to what extent does the department
 
00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:20.579 align:start position:0%
control its own destiny uh to what
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
extent can it be initiating
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
a job relook for positions that really
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
ought to be salaried and are currently
 
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
listed as hourly
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
they don't we live in a union
 
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
environment so they don't I mean the
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
short answer is they don't control their
 
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
own destiny at all
 
00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:41.930 align:start position:0%
own destiny at all
um

00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
to back up a step there are something
 
00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
like across state government 384-ish
 
00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:49.140 align:start position:0%
positions don't hold me to that but I
 
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
think it's the right number that are
 
00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
unclassified and historically those were
 
00:48:55.609 --> 00:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
meant to only be the division head and
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
the deputy in the division so in 1950
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
there were like 45 and or something like
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
that and over time it increased HHS in
 
00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
the mid 90s when Terry Morton was
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner established a set of
 
00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
positions something like 90 where he
 
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
received permission in the legislature
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
to convert 95 positions forcibly
 
00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:20.339 align:start position:0%
from classified to unclassified
 
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
positions with a
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
with a set of rules around them that's
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
the only time that's really happened
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
typically positions that are converted
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
are converted one off by the legislature
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
they can only be converted in a piece of
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
legislation or established unclassified
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
in a piece of legislation we currently
 
00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
exist in a world where
 
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:40.970 align:start position:0%
exist in a world where
um

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
almost all of the the Civil Service of
 
00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire is is paid as
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
if they're hourly and I use that
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
phrasing because I think that doj likes
 
00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
that because we we we're not a hundred
 
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
percent compliant exactly necessarily
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
with flsa
 
00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.309 align:start position:0%
with flsa
um

00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
to to take a bunch of those positions
 
00:50:05.089 --> 00:50:05.099 align:start position:0%
the let's just say for the sake of
 
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
argument the the highest labor grade
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
positions and to turn them or the or the
 
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
most managerial positions and to turn
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
them into salaried positions would
 
00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
require a negotiation with the Union
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
debate which Union depending on which
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
agency you're talking about with HHS it
 
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
would be with the sea and so that would
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
require because we're because we're a
 
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
you know a union shop if you will it
 
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
would require some discussion with the
 
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
sea and would have to be bargained So to
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
that extent they do not control their
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
own destiny in that respect
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire for a question
 
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so retention is
 
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
extremely important
 
00:50:44.809 --> 00:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
um we found out recently in discussion
 
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
with your office that fewer than 50
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
percent of group one state employees
 
00:50:53.329 --> 00:50:53.339 align:start position:0%
reach their 10th anniversary right so so
 
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
get ever get vested right I mean so this
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
is a big problem can you develop some
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
performance metrics so that we can know
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
over time whether this is getting better
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
or worse
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
and especially this could be a societal
 
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
sort of issue right I mean it could be
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
younger people have different ideas of
 
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
long-term employment versus others you
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
know older people things like that so
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
um I think we need some kind of metrics
 
00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:25.859 align:start position:0%
to say we're doing better we're doing
 
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
worse Etc yeah we uh so so we track as
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
people probably know the division of
 
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
personnel publishes an annual report
 
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
which is mostly a statistical report
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
um and it it uh they exist on our
 
00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
website going back to 2003
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sure there's hard copies
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
longer ago than that not that anybody
 
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
wants them but um that report has always
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
had in it um a list of separations from
 
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
State service and one of the metrics
 
00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
that they check on it is is separations
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
over time which is why we had that
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
discussion about about 50 percent
 
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
um what we can do what we will do
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
frankly whether we decide to or not
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
we're just we'll track that every year
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
on sort of an annualized basis on where
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
they are I think your your point about
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
societal change though is important I I
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.670 align:start position:0%
 
people

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
people expect to look I I think if you
 
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
were to talk to the average 35 year old
 
00:52:29.809 --> 00:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
let's say he or she has his resume
 
00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:31.859 align:start position:0%
perpetually updated
 
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
and keeps an updated copy of their
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
resume on their computer and updates at
 
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
every every
 
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
um so like six years ago the governor
 
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
decided to nominate me for
 
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
um in my current position and somebody
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
said to me I need a I need a resume
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
and I said are you sure because I don't
 
00:52:50.569 --> 00:52:50.579 align:start position:0%
I hadn't done a resume in in almost 20
 
00:52:52.849 --> 00:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
years and I didn't have one I went I
 
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
went and found one in an old version of
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Works and uh just to give you
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
an idea and it didn't have like my last
 
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
two or three positions and the one
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
person who I will argue was younger than
 
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
I am said what are you kidding me you
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
should have your resume should be
 
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
updated every time you get a promotion
 
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
change jobs whatever how do you not have
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
one on your I'm like I don't know I just
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
didn't but I think it I think it really
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
is a generational thing where where I
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
suspect if I surveyed people who who
 
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
work in our agency that probably
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
everybody under the age of
 
00:53:24.059 --> 00:53:25.309 align:start position:0%
everybody under the age of
50

00:53:25.309 --> 00:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
50
 
00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
40 anyway has a resume on their on their
 
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
home computer and and
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
I think that's probably not going to get
 
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:35.870 align:start position:0%
I think that's probably not going to get
better

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney for a question
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
being here on the other end of the
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
hiring Spectrum I'm curious is there an
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
average retirement age for state
 
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:49.069 align:start position:0%
average retirement age for state
employees

00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we have an average
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
um I I would say this to the extent that
 
00:53:57.049 --> 00:53:57.059 align:start position:0%
there is it's increasing from in terms
 
00:53:59.210 --> 00:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
of retirement retirement
 
00:54:02.089 --> 00:54:02.099 align:start position:0%
um the uh changes over the last about 10
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
years have affected the number of years
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
you have to say to qualify for retiree
 
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
Health which for
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
current workers is more like 20 instead
 
00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:11.339 align:start position:0%
of 10 means people are more like more
 
00:54:14.569 --> 00:54:14.579 align:start position:0%
more likely to work until they're 65.
 
00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
um the uh the cost of Health Care drives
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of those decisions as as anybody
 
00:54:23.329 --> 00:54:23.339 align:start position:0%
who is um at or near retirement age is
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
thinking about how much health care is
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
going to cost
 
00:54:28.609 --> 00:54:28.619 align:start position:0%
um when I was 25 I didn't care how much
 
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
health care it costs at all and that
 
00:54:33.049 --> 00:54:33.059 align:start position:0%
seems to have changed in my life but um
 
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
the cost of
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
um the premium cost of retired Health if
 
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
you're under 65 is significantly higher
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
than it was 10 years ago so we're seeing
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
more and more people stay until 65. but
 
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
I think 65 is still one of those
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
psychological things Social Security age
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
for people in their 50s is probably 67
 
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
normal social security age but
 
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:56.220 align:start position:0%
nonetheless 65 is when you get Medicare
 
00:54:57.530 --> 00:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
and I think people look at that and it
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
represent representative Murray for a
 
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
represent representative Murray for a
question

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:05.690 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:10.250 align:start position:0%
question
[Music]

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
surprised at some of this just coming
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
out of my own experience
 
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh I let me put the question this way
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
would people
 
00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
would you find that you might lose
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
someone's interest in a job because it's
 
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
an hourly position as opposed to a
 
00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
salaried position
 
00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
I think the opposite is true
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
um oddly I think that um in terms of
 
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
conversion we've talked a lot about
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
conversion because I because I agree
 
00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
that we should have
 
00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
um uh salary classified band of
 
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
positions but today for most of those
 
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
positions you know most of the state is
 
00:55:49.809 --> 00:55:49.819 align:start position:0%
a 37.5
 
00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
hour work week and if you work a 38th
 
00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
hour we must under flsa pay you extra
 
00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
for it
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
so in terms of
 
00:55:58.079 --> 00:55:58.609 align:start position:0%
so in terms of
um

00:55:58.609 --> 00:55:58.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:01.549 --> 00:56:01.559 align:start position:0%
doing that if I convert you from hourly
 
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
to salary one of the questions you ask
 
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
yourself is well if I'm averaging eight
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
hours of overtime
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
um what are you paying me now and one of
 
00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
the things you would have to do because
 
00:56:13.609 --> 00:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
you would you would naturally people who
 
00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
are in a flsa salary category are going
 
00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
to work something like 40 to 50 hours a
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
week and so you would have to convert
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
their salary
 
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
from 37.5 to 40 and then make that your
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
new salary base and so that becomes an
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
issue but I don't think we're losing
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
um just so that I'm clear again and
 
00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
again I'm coming from a different
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
tradition what you refer to as
 
00:56:40.849 --> 00:56:40.859 align:start position:0%
promotional pass what I possibly
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
interpret that as Merit increases
 
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
because when you're looking at the
 
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
salaried position
 
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
and you're going above and beyond you
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
know the 80 hour week there there is
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
compensation for that and it's can be
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
you know more significant in what states
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
would ever go for but
 
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:57.589 align:start position:0%
would ever go for but
um

00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
is that promotional path is your concept
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
of Merit increases it's not
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
um the difference is
 
00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.230 align:start position:0%
um the difference is
um

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
Merit increases tend to be on the basis
 
00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
of some sort of judgment that's made by
 
00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:13.309 align:start position:0%
of some sort of judgment that's made by
a

00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
judgment made by a manager somebody
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
decides there's somebody who's in charge
 
00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
of deciding how much you get and how
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
much you get and how much you get and
 
00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
whether you get something or whether you
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
don't get something in in the state
 
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
system and and again we're not we're
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
both a civil service system and a
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
unionized system
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
um everything is done by rule and and
 
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
what you would have to do is establish
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
um specific
 
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
um objective criteria on the basis of
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
which somebody would go from uh from a
 
00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
CPS W1 to a CPS W2 you received this you
 
00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
did this and it's not on the basis of of
 
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
a judgment call on the basis of a
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
supervisor follow-up thank you last one
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
so if you're really really good at what
 
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
you do how are you compensated how do
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
you how do you express to the person
 
00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
that they're doing an absolutely
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
fabulous job
 
00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.829 align:start position:0%
fabulous job
um verbally

00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:09.839 --> 00:58:10.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
you do everything you can it's a no it's
 
00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
a it's actually a really good question
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
that not financially
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
um the the system does not allow and
 
00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
again you know it's a it's a um a system
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
of rules and a system of uh of a Union
 
00:58:25.849 --> 00:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
contract and that there's there's
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
nothing specifically designed for that
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
it means that if you're a manager and
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
you're trying to retain uh retain Talent
 
00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:34.140 align:start position:0%
it's something I think about almost
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
literally every day
 
00:58:37.609 --> 00:58:37.619 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that you have to do
 
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
is is use
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know non-financial cues and
 
00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
appreciations and and and do your best
 
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
not to be a jerk
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
and that's a big thing
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I it's it sounds flipping right
 
00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
but not being a jerk is remarkably
 
00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:54.890 align:start position:0%
but not being a jerk is remarkably
important

00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
we'll always quote you on that
 
00:58:59.450 --> 00:58:59.460 align:start position:0%
representative papovichi Mueller for a
 
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and my
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
question is on Autumn time but just as a
 
00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
quick side note on what representative
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
Murray was talking about this has been
 
00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:11.220 align:start position:0%
one of my frustrations in my you know
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
three negotiations with public sector
 
00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:14.819 align:start position:0%
units that I've been in in New Hampshire
 
00:59:14.819 --> 00:59:16.309 align:start position:0%
units that I've been in in New Hampshire
that

00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
they seem to be very resistant to the
 
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
concept of any form of Merit pay but
 
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
this is something that obviously will
 
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
have to be dealt with with any
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
individual contract negotiation and so
 
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
on my question was based on the fact
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
that I used to work for the town of
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
Windham and
 
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
um we had made certain changes in your
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
time policy that led from us being
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
overly generous to some would say a bit
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
overly less than generous
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
how how do you feel the state policies
 
00:59:44.809 --> 00:59:44.819 align:start position:0%
on you know time offer and time vacation
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
and so on are in terms of our ability to
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know attract and retain employees
 
00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:53.460 align:start position:0%
I I would start by saying that if you
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
used to work for the town of Windham I'd
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
want to thank you because we stole one
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
of your best employees and made her our
 
00:59:58.859 --> 01:00:00.410 align:start position:0%
of your best employees and made her our
comptroller

01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
comptroller
 
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
um and somebody to whom I am every day
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
trying to offer
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
non-financial cues to keep her from
 
01:00:06.119 --> 01:00:07.490 align:start position:0%
non-financial cues to keep her from
leaving

01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
um so that's something
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
um are we generous are we not generous I
 
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
I would say this on on on wages the
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
state does not keep up well and I think
 
01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that on just in terms of
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
the actual salary or wage compensation
 
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
we do not necessarily keep up well we
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
have extraordinary benefits and I'm not
 
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
saying that just because it's my
 
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
department that administers the health
 
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
benefit package but we have a very good
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
very well administered and a very
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
um an above average health care plan and
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
it means if you're an employee for whom
 
01:00:43.609 --> 01:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
Health Care is important if I'm honest
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
that tends to be older not younger right
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
um that's an advantage in terms of time
 
01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:50.940 align:start position:0%
off I think we have a generous time off
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
policy we are our time off if you
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
compare us to other public sector
 
01:00:58.730 --> 01:00:58.740 align:start position:0%
employers cities sounds counties Etc it
 
01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
may not be as generous as um as some
 
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
towns tend to do better than the state
 
01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.089 align:start position:0%
towns tend to do better than the state
does

01:01:05.089 --> 01:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
um but if you compare us to the the
 
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
private sector we are generous this is a
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
this came up in our comp study
 
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
um they're they're generous we have we
 
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
have Personnel policies that
 
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
um basically keep employ keep Managers
 
01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.390 align:start position:0%
um basically keep employ keep Managers
from

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
not letting you take your time off I
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
mean there are obviously some some
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
things you have to do but if you earn
 
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
your time off you're entitled to take it
 
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
and and I think we stick with that and I
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
think in that respect I think it's
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
actually one of the advantages that
 
01:01:35.329 --> 01:01:35.339 align:start position:0%
attracts you to the state is work-life
 
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
balance thank you and just for the
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
record uh you guys making Dana an offer
 
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
she couldn't refuse was a spectacularly
 
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
wise decision thank you that's we agree
 
01:01:47.569 --> 01:01:47.579 align:start position:0%
okay members we're about to wrap this up
 
01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative Hull for a question
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman as a follow-up to
 
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
both Edwards and Murray I guess
 
01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:57.230 align:start position:0%
both Edwards and Murray I guess
um

01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
if you have an employee and you want to
 
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
do more than quote not be a jerk unquote
 
01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.150 align:start position:0%
do more than quote not be a jerk unquote
and

01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.109 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
and there's an interest on the part of
 
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
the employee
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
at becoming salary right contrary to the
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
data you just share they that's that's
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
an interest as opposed to hourly
 
01:02:16.319 --> 01:02:17.510 align:start position:0%
an interest as opposed to hourly
um

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
you're still going back to the union
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
even for a one-off to make a change or
 
01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
is this only when you're trying to do a
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
reclassification of it well no you to
 
01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
to change the terms and conditions of
 
01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
employment in a in a union situation you
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
have to negotiate with the Union that's
 
01:02:37.849 --> 01:02:37.859 align:start position:0%
that's just a thing and it's and it's
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
not about whether whether we agree or
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
don't agree it's not about whether
 
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
whether everybody's on board with it
 
01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
it's that um
 
01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
it's that it's a requirement of the of
 
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
the structure the fact that we are uh
 
01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
organized as a collective bargaining
 
01:02:55.849 --> 01:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
unit that we have to do that there are
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of one-offs there are
 
01:02:59.450 --> 01:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
occasional changes in the legislature is
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
familiar with this where a position here
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
or a position there our our Chief
 
01:03:05.569 --> 01:03:05.579 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer for example used to be
 
01:03:08.569 --> 01:03:08.579 align:start position:0%
a classified position and it is not that
 
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:12.839 align:start position:0%
those changes have to go through a um
 
01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:15.299 align:start position:0%
um go through legislation and as part of
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
that process frankly you know and I
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
think part of that is to allow the
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
employee a chance to object but in terms
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
of uh you know if you and I agree and
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
you say just pay me salary well our
 
01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
thank you what we haven't the only last
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
slide was on the hiring process because
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
I know people talked about it and there
 
01:03:35.809 --> 01:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
was there was a great deal of
 
01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
information that was presented to the
 
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
division three a few weeks ago that
 
01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't entirely in every particular
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
strictly speaking correct
 
01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
um and so I uh I I mentioned that in
 
01:03:51.049 --> 01:03:51.059 align:start position:0%
case the committee wanted to talk about
 
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:54.299 align:start position:0%
that we uh you know we make have made a
 
01:03:55.609 --> 01:03:55.619 align:start position:0%
lot of improvements over the last three
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
or four years until the hiring process
 
01:03:59.210 --> 01:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
in terms of streamlining it and making
 
01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
it easier to understand and more
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
accessible we have a long way to go in
 
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
this respect everybody has a long way to
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
go in this respect
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
um and a significant change will include
 
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
the next generation of the state CRP but
 
01:04:12.289 --> 01:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
I would just mention a couple things
 
01:04:14.089 --> 01:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
there were some discussion that perhaps
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
if you apply for a job on indeed it
 
01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't go to the job on the state's
 
01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
website that's incorrect something I
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
actually looked at myself directly with
 
01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:24.299 align:start position:0%
my staff we went on the internet went to
 
01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:26.339 align:start position:0%
indeed and occasionally you'll hear
 
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
things from employees who've not
 
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
actually done a task themselves and will
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
have heard something from somebody else
 
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
that's not strictly speaking correct and
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to bring that up in addition
 
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
in addition people have talked about how
 
01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:42.299 align:start position:0%
perhaps you have to post a job using
 
01:04:44.809 --> 01:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
some some of the archaic classification
 
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
titles that hasn't been true in decades
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
and uh and almost every agency in the
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
state does not do that because it's much
 
01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
easier to hire a vendor contract manager
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
than it is to hire an administrator too
 
01:04:59.569 --> 01:04:59.579 align:start position:0%
and if you're actually posting a job
 
01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
that says administrator two you're
 
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
making a mistake and so we we do a lot
 
01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
in that respect to try to and we try to
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
work with agencies this is actually one
 
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
of the goals of the recruitment unit
 
01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
because even within agencies there are
 
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:15.059 align:start position:0%
some people who are particularly good at
 
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
at figuring out how to hire a position
 
01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:20.220 align:start position:0%
well and there's some people who are who
 
01:05:23.809 --> 01:05:23.819 align:start position:0%
are less and our idea is to try to use
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
you know anything the Department of
 
01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
Labor learns to help the department of
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
insurance and anything the Department of
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
Insurance learns to help the Department
 
01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
of Employment Security there are 42
 
01:05:35.569 --> 01:05:35.579 align:start position:0%
state agencies depending a little bit on
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
how you count and we our goal is to help
 
01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
all of them in every respect because
 
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
they're all important
 
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
but happy to answer any questions on any
 
01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
of that or anything else thank you one
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
of the things that uh I think we've
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
observed that said on the finance
 
01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
committee both of your deputies we have
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
seen in other agencies and obviously
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's a way we also see a
 
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
constant change in LBA people that get
 
01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
trained and then move on to other
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
agencies and we forever see them coming
 
01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
back and other roles always dealing with
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
Finance of course as your deputies do
 
01:06:14.569 --> 01:06:14.579 align:start position:0%
but it is it is a wide open I guess it
 
01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:16.859 align:start position:0%
enables people to shift from one job
 
01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
within state to another fairly easily
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
without a lot of you know problems and
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
saying well you haven't been you haven't
 
01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
filled a full year yet or any of that
 
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
stuff you can move fairly easily which
 
01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
seems to be more uh help in being
 
01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
flexible in the job so I think it's
 
01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
actually very important for the state
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
system to allow people to move from
 
01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
agency to agency it creates an enormous
 
01:06:41.089 --> 01:06:41.099 align:start position:0%
situation it it happens that the two of
 
01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:42.299 align:start position:0%
them both men are a great deal of time
 
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
at HHS but and this committee's seen
 
01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
them over many years in many capacities
 
01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
I would I would say this that I am I
 
01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
benefit from having
 
01:06:55.609 --> 01:06:55.619 align:start position:0%
great employees one of whom we used to
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
work in a town of Wyndham two of whom
 
01:06:59.210 --> 01:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
used to work at HHS but otherwise you'd
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
have to rely upon my judgment rather
 
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
than theirs and you are much better off
 
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
relying on their judgment than mine and
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things we saw for years is
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
not every agency has a deep bench so
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
that you've got people lined up to
 
01:07:14.809 --> 01:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
replace as as people move up and and
 
01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
many agencies don't have that especially
 
01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
if they're not dealing much with finance
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
and they have one Finance Financial
 
01:07:22.849 --> 01:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
person where you're going to get that
 
01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:24.839 align:start position:0%
replacement from obviously somewhere
 
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
else in the state government so I'm glad
 
01:07:29.089 --> 01:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
we have that flexibility because it
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
seems to work out any other questions
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
from the members
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for this
 
01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
excellent presentation very enlightening
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
and I can't believe how much you dig
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
into history
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
happy to be here anytime thank you all
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
right we'll close that hearing
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
and we next are going to hearing on HB
 
01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
49a and I guess
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards and perhaps
 
01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn are going to make
 
01:07:56.460 --> 01:08:00.250 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn are going to make
presentations

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:00.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure of the right order to do
 
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
this Mr chair I I have I have two
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
amendments we can discuss uh either but
 
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be better to start with a
 
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
discussion on uh zero seven three eight
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's right so we have we have
 
01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:20.339 align:start position:0%
something else representative Earth
 
01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
there are two
 
01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
all right Mary Jane would you go to the
 
01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:35.630 align:start position:0%
all right Mary Jane would you go to the
mic

01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:39.179 align:start position:0%

01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:48.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:51.540 align:start position:0%

01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
Replacements I have two of three yes
 
01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:55.259 align:start position:0%

uh yes sir I would like to move
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
consideration on amendment to House Bill
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
202-30738 Hotel it's a relatively short
 
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
bill that focuses strictly on the
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
financial aspects of the sununu
 
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
replacement as well as
 
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
um making sure that we prioritize arpa
 
01:09:27.769 --> 01:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
money and we begin to go get a
 
01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:33.229 align:start position:0%
money and we begin to go get a
contractor

01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
all right I guess we're all getting
 
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
distributed that Amendment thank you
 
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
all right emotion and a second to accept
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
this is just a work session so it's at
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
best it's going to be a
 
01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:01.430 align:start position:0%
best it's going to be a
struggle

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
I'll wait for people to look over the
 
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
amendment is that all right sir
 
01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:26.810 align:start position:0%
amendment is that all right sir
certainly

01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
all right why don't we discuss the
 
01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
changes to the original Bill all right
 
01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you uh just a little bit of
 
01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:34.070 align:start position:0%
thank you uh just a little bit of
History

01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
History
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
um the sununu replacement Center has
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
been an ongoing issue for a couple of
 
01:10:40.729 --> 01:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
years at least and
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
um in the current session uh the Senate
 
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh passed sb1 24 to nothing sb1 had an
 
01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
approach appropriation in it had a lot
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
of detail about what the sununu
 
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
replacement Center how it should look
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
and feel from an operations perspective
 
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
how it should be co-located and leverage
 
01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:07.100 align:start position:0%
shared facilities and the like and
 
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
when it came over to the house the house
 
01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:12.500 align:start position:0%
was not able to
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
pass sb1 I was
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
reminded oftentimes during that effort
 
01:11:20.649 --> 01:11:20.659 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
we are a finance committee we are not a
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
policy committee and that sb1 had policy
 
01:11:30.649 --> 01:11:30.659 align:start position:0%
issues in it that was greater than what
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
our committee ought to be looking at so
 
01:11:39.169 --> 01:11:39.179 align:start position:0%
we did pass some of sb1 on a very fast
 
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
timeline to keep the facility from
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
closing prematurely on one March we did
 
01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
appropriate some money we did
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate some money for operations
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
and for
 
01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
the ability to go do a site selection
 
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
process we created a committee or
 
01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
commissioned to work with the local
 
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
community so I think we did maybe 15 to
 
01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:03.500 align:start position:0%
20 percent of sb1 what it wanted to do
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
and but we we left some major parts
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
laying on the ground and one of the
 
01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
major parts was we did not appropriate
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
the construction
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
and we did not tie up the Gopher and
 
01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
arpa money what this bill does is it
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
keeps finance and finances Lane and just
 
01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
deals with those two aspects of the
 
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
representative Earth
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chair could you just so when
 
01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
we had a meeting of divisions
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
three and one a few weeks back
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
and put Fourth Amendment this is not
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
that Amendment correct
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
this this is not I started with this
 
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
because there was a typo in the
 
01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
amendment you're referring to and that I
 
01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
think is uh now available but
 
01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
nevertheless logically I thought it was
 
01:13:05.689 --> 01:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
be better today since this is a work
 
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
session to build up from Ground Zero
 
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
you're right division one and three did
 
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
on a ten to five vote pass a version of
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.570 align:start position:0%
an amendment
so

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand how this
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
amendment relates to that Amendment this
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
is a different Amendment this is an
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that only deals with the
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
finance aspects division two has not
 
01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
heard any of this yet this is just the
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
financial consequences of us trying to
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
complete our work on the sununu
 
01:13:41.689 --> 01:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
replacement Center
 
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
if you would if you would prefer
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
here's my question it looks at this in
 
01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
some stuff in here that also was in
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
there is that just a misunderstanding in
 
01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
my part like the numbers the 21.6
 
01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:53.510 align:start position:0%
my part like the numbers the 21.6
million

01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
you know I don't remember exactly the
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
extent to which the numbers are the same
 
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
I think that the 21.6 million dollar
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
number has been floating around for a
 
01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
while so if it's the same number from
 
01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
what division one and three did I I that
 
01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
would make sense to me I think that's
 
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
where we were there's been so many
 
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
amendments on this representative Earth
 
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
that I can't remember everything that
 
01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
we've talked about okay and when we
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
talked about it
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
so are we going to see that one as well
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
or not going to see that I I think we
 
01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
can see that one this is this is uh
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
we're having a discussion on on what
 
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
this is and this is the Bare Bones
 
01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
nothing but Finance version of an
 
01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
amendment that would I think complete
 
01:14:39.649 --> 01:14:39.659 align:start position:0%
The house's work in 2023 on the sununu
 
01:14:42.410 --> 01:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
replacement Center we can we can do more
 
01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:49.669 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin for a question
 
01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
my question representative
 
01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
um is this still an 18 bed facility
 
01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:01.669 align:start position:0%
um is this still an 18 bed facility
yeah

01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
it it it would not change what's in
 
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
what's in sb1 in sp1 it it says that the
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
site selection should be looking at two
 
01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
options it should be looking at an
 
01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:16.820 align:start position:0%
option that is a six to twelve facility
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
or another option that uh staffs at as
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
though the residents were at 12
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
operationally staff at 12 but with a
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
physical capacity at 18. so so that's a
 
01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
now I went back and looked at uh the
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
women's prison
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
it costs 38 million dollars
 
01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:46.940 align:start position:0%
it serviced uh
 
01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
224 beds I believe
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
that comes out to about a hundred and
 
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand dollars a bed
 
01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
this comes out to something over a
 
01:15:59.450 --> 01:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
million dollars a bit
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
and I just there's no way in my mind I
 
01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
can justify the kind of money that's
 
01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
that's being put on the table here thank
 
01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:12.350 align:start position:0%
that's being put on the table here thank
you

01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I I think that's
 
01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
a that's a fine Financial observation I
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
would just you know point out just a few
 
01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
things that would bear on on your
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
observation one is that
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
um the uh the bonding of the woman's
 
01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
women's prison took place a number of
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
years ago and just even in the last
 
01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
couple of years we've seen a lot of
 
01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.410 align:start position:0%
couple of years we've seen a lot of
inflation

01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
01:16:40.330 --> 01:16:40.340 align:start position:0%
um also this is intentionally explicitly
 
01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:44.780 align:start position:0%
not a prison this is uh a continuation
 
01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
of the juvenile
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
mental health and Behavioral Health
 
01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
System the the the point of this
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
facility is not incarceration it's to
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
get away from an incarceration model and
 
01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:02.900 align:start position:0%
instead replace it with a
 
01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed uh I I keep forgetting
 
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
the terminology but basically being
 
01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:11.219 align:start position:0%
sensitive to the fact that these kids
 
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
probably need some mental Health
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
counseling more than they need to be in
 
01:17:16.729 --> 01:17:16.739 align:start position:0%
a prison environment so we're building
 
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
something different than what you're
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative Miller and then
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
representative Hull
 
01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair having you know just
 
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
recently visited the current facilities
 
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:33.659 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say I cannot comment on
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
whether the amount of dollars is right
 
01:17:37.729 --> 01:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
or not that will take a much deeper dive
 
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
but I would say that I I don't think we
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
should compare this with again pure uh
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
incarceration facilities because this
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
Center the whole route of the problems
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
was that it was originally treated as
 
01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
just incarceration and it created a lot
 
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
of issues there is much more that we
 
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
need to do for the very few miners that
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
will end up in those places they need
 
01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
very Specialized Care and again while I
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
cannot comment on whether this amount is
 
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
appropriate or not I would urge us to
 
01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
use a different Baseline because it is a
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
very different type of facility thank
 
01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.330 align:start position:0%
very different type of facility thank
you

01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I apologize I stepped
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
out so you may have covered this this is
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
a work session only there's a plan I
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
believe to have a follow-up work session
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
an executive session
 
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
that's true and then secondly in terms
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
of germanness on amendments right
 
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
because we're back to the original Bill
 
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
I know
 
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
that one of the Amendments that's been
 
01:18:35.689 --> 01:18:35.699 align:start position:0%
drafted has been looked at and has been
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
ruled effectively non-germaine we'll
 
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
have a hearing on that
 
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
when do we know where that line is
 
01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
between a bill that was relative to
 
01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:47.699 align:start position:0%
propose Pro to postponing the closure of
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
the sununu center to one that is now
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
discussing finances or any other changes
 
01:18:53.810 --> 01:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
of law
 
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
do we have to have all of these go
 
01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
through that hearing next week as
 
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
non-germaine since the dates already
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
we will have to determine on on the
 
01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
amendment after the committee hears it
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's non-germaine or not an
 
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate to the the line of
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
questioning we've had we obviously had
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
to do something or the sonuna Senate
 
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
would be closed by now then we also have
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
to follow up on the financing of the
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
replacement and obviously this this
 
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
gopher money came available but it had a
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
deadline so there's some urgency on
 
01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
operating on on that deadline and
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
getting make
 
01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
certain that we have the finance lined
 
01:19:41.890 --> 01:19:41.900 align:start position:0%
up and we're ready to construct
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
we will leave it up to Public Works to
 
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
how efficient or how how well designed
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
it is and we don't have that design yet
 
01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
so those are the things we have to look
 
01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
at but if
 
01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
if we decide it's germane after we've
 
01:19:59.149 --> 01:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
heard that the next Amendment at the at
 
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
the next public hearing then we may
 
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
incorporate it otherwise we may go ahead
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
with what we already have before us okay
 
01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
so but we've got to get something done
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.169 --> 01:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you for
 
01:20:17.689 --> 01:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just curious I'm
 
01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
trying to remember through the details
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
of Senate bill one and then taking this
 
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
amendment into account
 
01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
if representative Edwards could clarify
 
01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:28.490 align:start position:0%
if representative Edwards could clarify
if

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
this amendment also moves through who
 
01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
would then be the decision maker for
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
both the site and the ultimate
 
01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:36.950 align:start position:0%
both the site and the ultimate
um

01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
size of the facility or is that
 
01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
something that would be coming down the
 
01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.470 align:start position:0%
something that would be coming down the
road

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question if you if
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
you when you look at Amendment
 
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
0738 before you if you look at the end
 
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
of uh line 10 uh reading on to line 12.
 
01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
uh the department may use the final
 
01:21:00.649 --> 01:21:00.659 align:start position:0%
report of the commission established in
 
01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
RSA 169 blah blah in order to finalize
 
01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
the capacity and size selection of the
 
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
replacement Center so this moved it in
 
01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
previous versions that you saw where it
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
said governor and Council that was being
 
01:21:17.209 --> 01:21:17.219 align:start position:0%
floated this language came directly from
 
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
the governor's office this was their
 
01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:21.719 align:start position:0%
request for what we do with uh with this
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and I throughout
 
01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
this process I've been trying to figure
 
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
out how we can say yes to each other so
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
I took the governor's requested language
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
and included in in here thank you I
 
01:21:36.169 --> 01:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
appreciate the clarification
 
01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay we have two other co-sponsors in
 
01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:40.739 align:start position:0%
the room and and I'd like to recognize
 
01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
and see if they have anything they'd
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
like to add representative Lynn may have
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair um and members of
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
the committee I guess I'm I'm maybe a
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
little bit at a loss if if you are if
 
01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
the non-germaine Amendments that you're
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
talking about discussing at another
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
at another meeting uh pertain to what
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
what I've sort of referred to maybe
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
colloquially as the former House Bill
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
254 that is dealing with who who can be
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
committed for what if that's the subject
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
of the of the non-germaine amendment
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
then maybe I should wait until to
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
discuss it later uh but I'm not sure if
 
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
that is what you're talking about
 
01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
that's that's the amendment that the
 
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
house clerk has decided was non-germaine
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
and requested we have a separate hearing
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
on that so that's what's been scheduled
 
01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
that that was really the main thing that
 
01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
I want what I would that I was here to
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
to sort of talk about
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
um but and I'm happy to do that you know
 
01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
at the net whenever you have the next
 
01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
year thank you representative Earth
 
01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
when's the when's the date of the
 
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:54.169 align:start position:0%
when's the when's the date of the
hearing

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to get a straw poll on the
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
acceptance of what we've got so far
 
01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:23:03.169 --> 01:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
once I have that understanding amongst
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
all of us then we look at the the final
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
HP 49 will make a decision as to the
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
germaneness of it by this committee and
 
01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.250 align:start position:0%
germaneness of it by this committee and
then

01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
if that's the instance we'll either use
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
it and incorporate it and vote on one
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
time on the bill with all the Amendments
 
01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
or we will vote on the bill without the
 
01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
the so-called non-germaine Amendment
 
01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
which we haven't judged yet to be
 
01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:31.430 align:start position:0%
which we haven't judged yet to be
non-germaine

01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative Erv so I think I think
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
the question that representative Lynn is
 
01:23:36.770 --> 01:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
asking is are we talking about the other
 
01:23:38.209 --> 01:23:38.219 align:start position:0%
Amendment and it sounds like
 
01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards has one as well
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
I'll be discussing all these amendments
 
01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
today are we waiting until after the
 
01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
public hearing related to the
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
non-germaine one before we discuss
 
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
anything else since we don't have that
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment before us that I believe that
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh show you the people here have all
 
01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
worked hard on we don't have it before
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
us at this point we do we have it here
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
well since the clerk has said we need to
 
01:24:03.169 --> 01:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
have a hearing I think it's more that we
 
01:24:04.729 --> 01:24:04.739 align:start position:0%
more appropriate that we have the
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
hearing and let everybody know that may
 
01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
want to have input and then have have
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%
the discussion of the one that's that's
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
been told we need to have a separate
 
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
hearing for so that's that's what I'd
 
01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
like to proceed
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
that that's fine with me Miss Jared I
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
just I'll I assume they'll be noticing
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
when the hearing is and I'll I'll appear
 
01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
there and
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
um and you know uh that's what I'm fine
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
do we have a date on that representative
 
01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
Earth I work for Wednesday
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
a week from Wednesday
 
01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:34.189 align:start position:0%
a week from Wednesday
Wednesday

01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
01:24:37.850 --> 01:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
the 15th okay all right time
 
01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
10 A.M
 
01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
I'll be there thank you all right and
 
01:24:44.630 --> 01:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative leishman did you want to
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
comment on this amendment
 
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
I do support this amendment
 
01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
thank you representative walner
 
01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
I got my question answered I wanted to
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
know when the non-termaine amendment was
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
going to be heard I do want I do want to
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
ask though
 
01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
it would seem like
 
01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
we would want to hear the non-germaine
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
amendment and this one at the work on
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
this one and the non-germaine amendment
 
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
together incorporating it into one one
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment and not
 
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
a bunch of
 
01:25:21.709 --> 01:25:21.719 align:start position:0%
a bunch of separate little amendments
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
how many how many other members would
 
01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
like to see that other Amendment today
 
01:25:27.130 --> 01:25:27.140 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
the one that's been judged non-germaine
 
01:25:36.410 --> 01:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:44.159 --> 01:25:44.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
I have it I didn't print out hard copies
 
01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
because I thought it wouldn't be heard
 
01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
by the committee until next week but I
 
01:25:51.709 --> 01:25:51.719 align:start position:0%
can do that and have them available
 
01:25:51.719 --> 01:25:53.450 align:start position:0%
can do that and have them available
shortly

01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
shortly
 
01:25:55.490 --> 01:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
just people want to have it to look at
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
we're not going to discuss it till the
 
01:26:00.110 --> 01:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing but so anybody can can
 
01:26:01.729 --> 01:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
see what's in it and get a chance to
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
read it because I think it's about five
 
01:26:03.719 --> 01:26:04.729 align:start position:0%
read it because I think it's about five
pages

01:26:04.729 --> 01:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
pages
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
nine pages so it's fairly it's fairly uh
 
01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.189 align:start position:0%
nine pages so it's fairly it's fairly uh
voluminous

01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
voluminous
 
01:26:10.199 --> 01:26:11.870 align:start position:0%
voluminous
so

01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.790 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:15.649 --> 01:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for this amendment
 
01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
um and for your clarification on the
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
lines 10 through 12. uh question on on
 
01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:26.820 align:start position:0%
um on the amount and the timing that
 
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
you're putting it in in this year's
 
01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:29.689 align:start position:0%
you're putting it in in this year's
budget

01:26:29.689 --> 01:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
um the 21.6 million
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
um it it uh in in part I thought the the
 
01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
total need may be less than 21 million
 
01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
depending on the final design so
 
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
um and I believe hb2 has a number less
 
01:26:47.770 --> 01:26:47.780 align:start position:0%
than 21 I think it's 10 million
 
01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
appropriated for this purpose so
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
um uh why should we put 21.6 million out
 
01:26:57.050 --> 01:26:57.060 align:start position:0%
of this year's budget for this purpose
 
01:26:58.850 --> 01:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
what do we gain by that rather than
 
01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
putting it in the next biennium budget
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
and um uh and any comment on the
 
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
differences with hb2 thank you
 
01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
it might be because of the amount of
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
money that's available through the
 
01:27:14.689 --> 01:27:14.699 align:start position:0%
through the federal funding that's
 
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
that's going to go away
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
so represent which you want to add to
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
that yeah yes sir two things one um this
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
language also came straight from the
 
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
governor's office it's an enhancement of
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
what we had read previously and it tries
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
to tighten up the CL and clarify our
 
01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
desire to have this as much as possible
 
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
federally funded to the to the issue of
 
01:27:43.010 --> 01:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
the 21.6 million estimate Mr ribson is
 
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
uh is in the room he he might be a more
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
authoritative person to speak to that
 
01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:56.090 --> 01:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
Mr ribsom is a director ribsum is
 
01:27:56.100 --> 01:28:02.709 align:start position:0%
Mr ribsom is a director ribsum is
recognized

01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
good morning still yes good morning Joe
 
01:28:08.209 --> 01:28:08.219 align:start position:0%
rubs from director dcyf thank you uh for
 
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
hearing from me the 21.6 million dollar
 
01:28:13.729 --> 01:28:13.739 align:start position:0%
estimate is the estimate that Das Public
 
01:28:16.129 --> 01:28:16.139 align:start position:0%
Works provided for the cost of building
 
01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
uh the replacement facility my
 
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the thinking
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
behind the way that the budget in hb2 is
 
01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
crafted that has 10 million dollars in
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
general funds the idea was that that
 
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
would be I believe in addition to what
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
was what was anticipated to be 15
 
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
million dollars through ARP so that's
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
gets you actually the 25 million total
 
01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
that being said 21.6 is the agreed upon
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
number at this point that um that Public
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
Works has put forward is the cost for
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
creating a replacement facility
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
and my recollection is we had uh Mr
 
01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
cupper from Public Works saying you
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't build an 18 bed for the 15
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
million so he felt some of that was some
 
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
of that estimate was for a 12 million
 
01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
and he he came before us last week I
 
01:29:07.970 --> 01:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
believe to say you needed 21 million
 
01:29:09.530 --> 01:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards you had further
 
01:29:13.729 --> 01:29:13.739 align:start position:0%
so so my thought on this Mr chairman is
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
if if we get this version or this amount
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
out of the house and get some feedback
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
from the Senate preferably they would
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
pass it then we could adjust hb2 I think
 
01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
appropriately to take care of
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
Representative stringham's observation
 
01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
that maybe some of this money is being
 
01:29:36.410 --> 01:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
further from representative ribsum you
 
01:29:44.689 --> 01:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yes Mr Remsen um
 
01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
at I agree with representative Griffin's
 
01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
point that this is a very expensive
 
01:29:58.129 --> 01:29:58.139 align:start position:0%
facility but in my mind the real money
 
01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
here is the operational money
 
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the original House
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 49 it allocated
 
01:30:10.669 --> 01:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
um one and a half million dollars for
 
01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
um three months of operation so we're
 
01:30:15.729 --> 01:30:15.739 align:start position:0%
talking about six million dollars a year
 
01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
for operational expenses is that what
 
01:30:23.450 --> 01:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
you expect this facility once built to
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
to cost
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
so I I don't think
 
01:30:29.330 --> 01:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
um the the additional appropriation of
 
01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
1.5 million is not the total cost of
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
three months of operations at sysc that
 
01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
was the supplement even worse that was
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
the supplemental that was needed in
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
order to to close out the year given the
 
01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
reduction in
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
um outside funds that used to come in
 
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
through the Vermont contract plus the
 
01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
extensive overtime that we're paying
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
right now just to keep the facility
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
safely operating given the fact that our
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
Workforce has has essentially been
 
01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.070 align:start position:0%
Workforce has has essentially been
decimated

01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
decimated
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
um the information that I shared with
 
01:30:59.689 --> 01:30:59.699 align:start position:0%
division three and I think I have some
 
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
copies of in my folder I know Mr Ripple
 
01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
has was that we were anticipating
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
somewhere just under three million
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
dollars a year just in Personnel savings
 
01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
by being able to have a co-located model
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
so there are operational savings year
 
01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
after year by having a co-located model
 
01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
where we'd be either near in proximity
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire hospital or Hampstead
 
01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:21.900 align:start position:0%
Hospital for the purpose of being able
 
01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
to share certain types of services and
 
01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
programming you have more of an
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity for shared services at
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
Hampstead because in addition to kind of
 
01:31:32.330 --> 01:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
core functions like food laundry Etc you
 
01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
would also have the potential ability to
 
01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
share Educational Services and Clinical
 
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
Services in a way that New Hampshire
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
hospital wouldn't offer a shared service
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity so um there's that piece of
 
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
it then there's the cost of just
 
01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
maintaining this massive campus with
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
with buildings that are not in good
 
01:31:51.290 --> 01:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
shape right would end the size of the
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
facility itself we spend eight hundred
 
01:31:53.629 --> 01:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year just in
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
utilities on that campus that that
 
01:31:57.770 --> 01:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the same if we were to move
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
to a smaller facility co-located
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
elsewhere so there are definitely
 
01:32:03.530 --> 01:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
operational savings to be realized year
 
01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
after year by moving to a lake located
 
01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:06.890 align:start position:0%
after year by moving to a lake located
model

01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
model
 
01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:07.669 align:start position:0%
model
um

01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
and I do think by any estimate if you're
 
01:32:11.810 --> 01:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
looking at magnitudes of three plus
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year in operational
 
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
savings that you know the cost of the
 
01:32:18.169 --> 01:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
facility is going to pay for itself in a
 
01:32:20.209 --> 01:32:20.219 align:start position:0%
number of years
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards since this is a
 
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
work session I I it may have value to go
 
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
ahead and bring forward the other more
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Amendment so that people
 
01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
can understand that
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
at least between these two amendments we
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
have some different kinds of choices to
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
make there's some similarities but there
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
are some differences so with with your
 
01:32:58.250 --> 01:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
permission I'd like to have us bring
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
forward the Second Amendment
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
is is that the one that that was
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
referred to as non-germain or is it
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
another one you have this is not the
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
non-germaine one the the non-germaine
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
one it changes the criminal code this
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.739 --> 01:33:19.790 align:start position:0%
 
relationship

01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay this this is one that had an
 
01:33:27.850 --> 01:33:27.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
but let's let's hand it out we're for
 
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
some reason we're just having an
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
extremely unusual hard time having OLS
 
01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
and me communicate on on what words they
 
01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
ought to be putting we met at nine
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
o'clock this morning and there's a
 
01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
second error even though we met in
 
01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:47.390 align:start position:0%
second error even though we met in
person

01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
um all right we'll give we'll give Mr
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
Ripple time to pass it out so everybody
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative hole did you have a
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
question while this is going on thank
 
01:33:58.679 --> 01:33:59.510 align:start position:0%
question while this is going on thank
you

01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:34:03.649 --> 01:34:03.659 align:start position:0%
um looking at 0738 right lines 11 and
 
01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
following sorry lines 13 and following
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
this has to do with whether we can use
 
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
arpa funds for any of this I'm not sure
 
01:34:15.410 --> 01:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
if the committee is aware
 
01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:16.070 align:start position:0%
if the committee is aware
um

01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
our neighboring state of Maine is
 
01:34:21.290 --> 01:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
currently being sued by the ACLU of
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
Maine for the use of just a mere 1.2
 
01:34:25.970 --> 01:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
million dollars of arpa funds for the
 
01:34:29.689 --> 01:34:29.699 align:start position:0%
renovation of a facility we should tread
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
carefully on this I'm not sure that that
 
01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
money was being it will be available so
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
I think the committee should be aware of
 
01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:38.090 align:start position:0%
I think the committee should be aware of
that

01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
do you recall the nature of why they're
 
01:34:42.649 --> 01:34:42.659 align:start position:0%
suing and what they're objecting to in
 
01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
the use of Opera funds
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
I can yes I can read the news article
 
01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:48.950 align:start position:0%
I can yes I can read the news article
right

01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
um the American Rescue plan was intended
 
01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
to support local governments and
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
responding to the impacts of covid-19 on
 
01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
their communities although Penobscot is
 
01:34:59.570 --> 01:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
is correct the arpa funds could not be
 
01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
used to build a new jail it is wrong for
 
01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:03.179 align:start position:0%
arpa funds to provide a blank check for
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
all jail Renovations so they're already
 
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
clear that it can't be used for a new
 
01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
jail and this is a juvenile facility not
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
a jail there are differences but in some
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
cases there's a lot more similarities
 
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
between these I don't want the committee
 
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
to blindly believe that we have this
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
blank check available that we might not
 
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
have available so I I want to bring it
 
01:35:27.649 --> 01:35:27.659 align:start position:0%
to the committee's attention now before
 
01:35:29.689 --> 01:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
we proceed
 
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'll ask representative a correct
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
correction I'll ask director ribson if
 
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
he has any knowledge about the arpa
 
01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
funds and whether or not there'd be any
 
01:35:43.970 --> 01:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:45.470 align:start position:0%
 
hey

01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
hey
 
01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
um I think it was in division three that
 
01:35:50.209 --> 01:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
we talked about this issue as well I am
 
01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
certainly not the expert on the on on
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
the use of our funds what I can tell you
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
is that this is conversations that have
 
01:35:58.129 --> 01:35:58.139 align:start position:0%
been had with gopher
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
um you know for well over a year now
 
01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:01.860 align:start position:0%
when this was first being thought about
 
01:36:03.709 --> 01:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
last year and it was an approved expense
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
through their processes but I think they
 
01:36:07.689 --> 01:36:07.699 align:start position:0%
would be the ones who'd be best
 
01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
positioned to go deep on that issue
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
which as far as you know the question
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
has been raised and dealt with
 
01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:16.490 align:start position:0%
has been raised and dealt with
yes

01:36:16.490 --> 01:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
um the way that the process works is you
 
01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
know we put forward what the what the
 
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
intended use is they have a legal review
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
and all types of other things that they
 
01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
do before they move forward and my
 
01:36:27.649 --> 01:36:27.659 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that had been done
 
01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
and that there was funding put aside
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
specifically for this purpose thank you
 
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative erf thank you Mr chair
 
01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:35.699 align:start position:0%
and this is not a question from Mr ribs
 
01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
and this is just a a point of
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
information so we have tried and I
 
01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
personally but also others have to try
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
to get the legal opinion from gopher
 
01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
regarding this and we're not
 
01:36:48.290 --> 01:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
heard from them they also invited to
 
01:36:50.209 --> 01:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
several of our work sessions and they
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
haven't shown it that had any of them to
 
01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
talk about this so we don't really have
 
01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
a definitive answer to the question
 
01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
which I think is what representative
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
is there anyone present that can comment
 
01:37:08.570 --> 01:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
on the Gopher situation please come
 
01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:12.729 align:start position:0%
on the Gopher situation please come
forward

01:37:12.729 --> 01:37:12.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh good well I guess it's still morning
 
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Chase Hageman I'm
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
the deputy director at the governor's
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
office for emergency relief and Recovery
 
01:37:35.169 --> 01:37:35.179 align:start position:0%
do you spell your last name
 
01:37:38.570 --> 01:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
h-a-g-a-m-a-n thank you
 
01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
uh so I guess I can just jump right in
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh to the question at hand about whether
 
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
arpa State fiscal recovery funds could
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
be used on the facility of this nature
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
um the gopher's opinion on this based
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
off of federal guidance is that yes it
 
01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
can based on the eligibility category
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
that we would recommend using for those
 
01:37:57.229 --> 01:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
funds on the facility
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
the I don't know the nature of the
 
01:38:01.610 --> 01:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
lawsuit with our neighbors or what
 
01:38:03.649 --> 01:38:03.659 align:start position:0%
eligibility category the state may have
 
01:38:06.410 --> 01:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
used for their facility and use of funds
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
but the eligibility category for
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
government services is a very broad one
 
01:38:13.610 --> 01:38:13.620 align:start position:0%
that treasury has given quite a bit of
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
latitude to states to use on a variety
 
01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
of types of facilities and and
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures and this would this would
 
01:38:22.729 --> 01:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
qualify for it
 
01:38:25.729 --> 01:38:25.739 align:start position:0%
thank you represent hole did you have a
 
01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
question for this gentleman
 
01:38:30.410 --> 01:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
not at this time thank you
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative erf
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
could you just provide us that uh
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
written opinion so we have that for
 
01:38:41.090 --> 01:38:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%

then I I would like to start a
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
conversation about uh the Second
 
01:38:58.090 --> 01:38:58.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
2023-0757 hotel that's been handed out
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
for those people who have looked at uh
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
sb1 and you start to flip through this
 
01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
this is going to look extremely and feel
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
very familiar to you because this is
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
this is the part of sb1 that we did not
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
pass when we did our truncated version
 
01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
to uh for uh for close the closure
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
so so this uh we'll go ahead and
 
01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
maintain the whole statement of findings
 
01:39:36.110 --> 01:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
that has been vetted numerous times it
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
it goes on to describe who's going to be
 
01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
responsible for it it goes on to
 
01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
describe that the facility is going to
 
01:39:45.729 --> 01:39:45.739 align:start position:0%
be managed
 
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
by the department and not be contracted
 
01:39:53.330 --> 01:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
out it describes on the second page some
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:39:59.649 --> 01:39:59.659 align:start position:0%
characteristics of the facility design
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
it talks about the facility programming
 
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
and and operations
 
01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:07.310 align:start position:0%
and and operations
um

01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
so this is this is essentially it talks
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
about on the bottom page three the
 
01:40:15.610 --> 01:40:15.620 align:start position:0%
reporting that we're expecting
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
in other words this is all of the
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
components of sb1 that we said we didn't
 
01:40:24.649 --> 01:40:24.659 align:start position:0%
have time to consider last time and this
 
01:40:27.649 --> 01:40:27.659 align:start position:0%
is our second bite at the Apple
 
01:40:29.930 --> 01:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
um I I apologize to the committee
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
because on page
 
01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.390 align:start position:0%
because on page
4

01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
4
 
01:40:39.890 --> 01:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
lines 10 through 12. I I thought we had
 
01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
a very specific conversation this
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
morning that that language lines 10
 
01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
through 12 about the governor and
 
01:40:48.770 --> 01:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
Council was to be removed
 
01:40:52.450 --> 01:40:52.460 align:start position:0%
and replaced with the phrase that's on
 
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
zero seven three eight that phrase being
 
01:40:58.189 --> 01:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
the department may use the final report
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
of the commission established in RSA 169
 
01:41:03.890 --> 01:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
in order to finalize the capacity and
 
01:41:05.689 --> 01:41:05.699 align:start position:0%
site selection of the replacement Center
 
01:41:08.209 --> 01:41:08.219 align:start position:0%
that that it was supposed to be there I
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know why it's not but um
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
but otherwise this is a pretty good
 
01:41:18.169 --> 01:41:18.179 align:start position:0%
document I think for conversation it's
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's basically the rest of sb1 it's got
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's language in there about
 
01:41:26.689 --> 01:41:26.699 align:start position:0%
the authority to select a version of the
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
of the building and it should have Mr Mr
 
01:41:33.169 --> 01:41:33.179 align:start position:0%
Ripple I'm going to look at you it it it
 
01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
does have the same language for the the
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
Gopher money at the last bottom of the
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
sheet right so we're we're at least in
 
01:41:43.729 --> 01:41:43.739 align:start position:0%
sync that we got the governor's language
 
01:41:46.850 --> 01:41:46.860 align:start position:0%
relative to the the arpa money in here
 
01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:48.590 align:start position:0%
relative to the the arpa money in here
so

01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:49.370 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:54.050 --> 01:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
so so so that is the longer Bill uh I
 
01:41:56.209 --> 01:41:56.219 align:start position:0%
offered it if the
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee had the appetite to
 
01:42:02.209 --> 01:42:02.219 align:start position:0%
finish the sb1 work
 
01:42:05.570 --> 01:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
this will get us through all of the sb1
 
01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:06.410 align:start position:0%
this will get us through all of the sb1
work

01:42:06.410 --> 01:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
the shorter amendment was for those
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
people who didn't have the appetite to
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
go through all of that and wanted to see
 
01:42:15.770 --> 01:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
children and family law involved and
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to see perhaps some other
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions involved the second one is
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
merely let's do our job and complete the
 
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
finance work so so that's that's what
 
01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
is everyone clear about looking at the
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
three amendments I'd probably do a straw
 
01:42:38.090 --> 01:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
vote on each of them the first one is
 
01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:41.649 align:start position:0%
vote on each of them the first one is
zero

01:42:41.649 --> 01:42:41.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
what's the first one here
 
01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:49.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
all right I guess it's two amendments
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
we're looking at here
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner
 
01:42:57.770 --> 01:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we wait until we had seen the
 
01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
non-drain amendment at the at the
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
hearing before we started taking straw
 
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
votes I mean it's like people are trying
 
01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:06.350 align:start position:0%
votes I mean it's like people are trying
to

01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
decide which one they prefer or like
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
which parts of each one so I'm
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we now have
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
two amendments before us there's another
 
01:43:22.370 --> 01:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
one coming I think next Wednesday
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't we wait and put it all
 
01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
together once we've seen all the pieces
 
01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
I'm feeling they're all part of the same
 
01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:31.090 align:start position:0%
I'm feeling they're all part of the same
thing

01:43:31.090 --> 01:43:31.100 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
0758 talks about
 
01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
0738 rather talks about
 
01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
can we can we adopt the funding while
 
01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
it's available
 
01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
then 0757
 
01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
talks about some of the details of what
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
is what's going to happen when it's
 
01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
built so they're all part of the same
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
thing without one replacing another and
 
01:43:58.490 --> 01:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
then the other one we'll look at so what
 
01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do is if everybody's happy
 
01:44:02.810 --> 01:44:02.820 align:start position:0%
with the funding that we're looking at
 
01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:03.850 align:start position:0%
with the funding that we're looking at
here

01:44:03.850 --> 01:44:03.860 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:44:07.129 --> 01:44:07.139 align:start position:0%
0738 and and the process we've heard
 
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
from the gentleman from gopher and Mr
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
ribson on how this figure was derived
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
from it is very expensive granted but we
 
01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:17.159 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of choice here and if
 
01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
if we can get a lot of this money from
 
01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
the federal government it isn't
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
something we'd have to incorporate into
 
01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
hb2 or hb1 so if people are satisfied
 
01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
with what the the explanation we've
 
01:44:32.209 --> 01:44:32.219 align:start position:0%
heard I'd like to do the straw vote
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
first on 0738 so we're satisfied that
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
there is a source of funds there is a
 
01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
source of perhaps gopher or arpa funds
 
01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
that will
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
supplant some of the
 
01:44:48.169 --> 01:44:48.179 align:start position:0%
State money
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
to get this built and it also has a
 
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
deadline that we have to be aware of
 
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
Representative Hewitt
 
01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry but I I don't think I'm in a
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
position to make any judgments on this
 
01:45:02.209 --> 01:45:02.219 align:start position:0%
um we have a different language in in
 
01:45:04.729 --> 01:45:04.739 align:start position:0%
two different amendments as an old bill
 
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
that is no longer being considered I
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
guess and then we've got another one
 
01:45:09.239 --> 01:45:10.189 align:start position:0%
guess and then we've got another one
coming

01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh we need to be able to put the whole
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
thing together and see how how it's
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
going to work and just to say that well
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
the Opera funds would be good or
 
01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
something else would be good it's not
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
going to not going to do any good in
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
terms of deciding what the heck to do I
 
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
think that before we take a straw vote
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
we need to know what the heck we're
 
01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
going to do in the final analysis and
 
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
not uh just take little pieces and put
 
01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
them down the table and say this is what
 
01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to do I can see that as
 
01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
causing a great deal of commotion once
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
we get to the point where we've seen all
 
01:45:47.930 --> 01:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
the moving pots put together
 
01:45:49.729 --> 01:45:49.739 align:start position:0%
how many agree with that statement by
 
01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
all right sufficient that we won't do a
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
straw vote on these we'll wait until
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday a week from Wednesday
 
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
when we'll see the last Amendment where
 
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
we'll have Judgment of putting it all
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
together and I know that Mr Ripple is
 
01:46:11.689 --> 01:46:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
we we can hand it out now so people will
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
have all these pieces together to look
 
01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
at and and decide whether it all fits
 
01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
together or not so
 
01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards so I understand
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
what we just did but
 
01:46:30.410 --> 01:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
for somebody who's been pushing this
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
rock up the hill for two years one thing
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
that we seem to be able to do every
 
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
single time is to find another reason to
 
01:46:39.420 --> 01:46:40.910 align:start position:0%
single time is to find another reason to
delay

01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
delay
 
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
it's just the the these two amendments
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
that I offered today are well within the
 
01:46:51.890 --> 01:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
defined terrain of everything this house
 
01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:54.719 align:start position:0%
has seen this year that the Senate voted
 
01:46:57.770 --> 01:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
on 24 to nothing the non-germaine
 
01:46:59.689 --> 01:46:59.699 align:start position:0%
amendment that's being brought in at the
 
01:47:02.570 --> 01:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
11th Hour dealing with the criminal code
 
01:47:06.290 --> 01:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
by the finance committee is the
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
exception to the process
 
01:47:11.810 --> 01:47:11.820 align:start position:0%
um and I'm
 
01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
fine let's let's wait but uh I I guess
 
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just losing my patience for
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
um the way in which we find new ways
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
creative ways to delay the process at
 
01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
some point we ought to have an honest to
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
God conversation about what we're
 
01:47:35.090 --> 01:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
willing to do and do it
 
01:47:37.370 --> 01:47:37.380 align:start position:0%
representative Hall thank you Mr
 
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
chairman it is my understanding that any
 
01:47:43.010 --> 01:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
deadline regarding use or potential use
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
of arpa funds is in the December 2025
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
time frame I may be wrong but there was
 
01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
a discussion in division three
 
01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:53.510 align:start position:0%
a discussion in division three
um

01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
and it has to do right and it's not
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
something where the additional week of
 
01:48:00.890 --> 01:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
discussing various options is going to
 
01:48:03.290 --> 01:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
put that at Jeopardy it's not like we
 
01:48:05.570 --> 01:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
have to commit to and use these funds by
 
01:48:08.090 --> 01:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
even the end of April or the end of of
 
01:48:10.010 --> 01:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
this session right it's about having
 
01:48:12.169 --> 01:48:12.179 align:start position:0%
turning the keys over to this facility
 
01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
to a new to DHHS to have as operational
 
01:48:20.209 --> 01:48:20.219 align:start position:0%
um and then secondly I don't know how if
 
01:48:23.450 --> 01:48:23.460 align:start position:0%
there's a way I I can Mr Ripple put this
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
up under the division three or under the
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
finance so other citizens can see and
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
weigh in on this if we're gonna have a
 
01:48:30.890 --> 01:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
public hearing for full transparency I
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
think it makes sense to be a that this
 
01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
document be allowed to be visible now
 
01:48:36.649 --> 01:48:36.659 align:start position:0%
even though it's only going to come up
 
01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
next week it should be something we can
 
01:48:41.570 --> 01:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
post as a as a discussion item
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
under the the LBA
 
01:48:46.609 --> 01:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
he left the room though I don't see Mr
 
01:48:49.490 --> 01:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
Ripple here now but we can we can ask
 
01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
that he do that
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
I I would ask that um that instead of
 
01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
posting zero seven five seven that we
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
know OLS continued the error that we uh
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
post the correct version of the
 
01:49:08.570 --> 01:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
amendment when it's available
 
01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:10.129 align:start position:0%
amendment when it's available
done

01:49:10.129 --> 01:49:10.139 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Mueller
 
01:49:15.169 --> 01:49:15.179 align:start position:0%
and then representative McGuire just a
 
01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
very quick statement I do not think that
 
01:49:20.689 --> 01:49:20.699 align:start position:0%
I will be comfortable in the next three
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
weeks looking at any policy decisions on
 
01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:23.990 align:start position:0%
weeks looking at any policy decisions on
this

01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:49:26.510 --> 01:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
we don't I barely don't see how we'll
 
01:49:28.250 --> 01:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
have the time to do the state budget let
 
01:49:30.050 --> 01:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
alone start making complex policy
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
decisions so as far as I'm concerned I
 
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
will look at funding this but I'm not
 
01:49:36.169 --> 01:49:36.179 align:start position:0%
gonna really spend a lot of time and
 
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
effort frankly looking at last minute
 
01:49:40.370 --> 01:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
policy changes here there are other
 
01:49:42.590 --> 01:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
committees other places to discuss that
 
01:49:44.689 --> 01:49:44.699 align:start position:0%
we have enough on our table
 
01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGuire
 
01:49:49.490 --> 01:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just a comment on
 
01:49:51.770 --> 01:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
zero seven five seven
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
um on page two where it says the
 
01:49:56.209 --> 01:49:56.219 align:start position:0%
facility shall be designed to include
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
all these things
 
01:49:58.080 --> 01:49:59.209 align:start position:0%
all these things
um

01:49:59.209 --> 01:49:59.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:01.729 --> 01:50:01.739 align:start position:0%
some of these things I think may be
 
01:50:05.450 --> 01:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
taken care of by the co-location with
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
the other facility in Hampstead and
 
01:50:10.490 --> 01:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
maybe this should be written in such a
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
way that the facility and the co-located
 
01:50:17.209 --> 01:50:17.219 align:start position:0%
um other facilities shall provide these
 
01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
things you see what I mean because
 
01:50:21.649 --> 01:50:21.659 align:start position:0%
because like I I could read C and and
 
01:50:25.609 --> 01:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
possibly G as being things that might be
 
01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.209 --> 01:50:32.219 align:start position:0%
for two years now I've asked for people
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
to provide written documentation on what
 
01:50:37.790 --> 01:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
they'd like to see in this bill and I I
 
01:50:39.410 --> 01:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
would be happy to take whatever language
 
01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
you have to offer okay
 
01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
I'll try to help him yeah
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple while you were out it was
 
01:50:49.729 --> 01:50:49.739 align:start position:0%
asked that you
 
01:50:53.450 --> 01:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
post this zero seven
 
01:50:57.229 --> 01:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
five seven on the website and also that
 
01:51:00.609 --> 01:51:00.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Mr chair if I may to post zero seven
 
01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
four six on the website and to post zero
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
seven five seven H as re with the
 
01:51:21.890 --> 01:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
Amendments that uh representative
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
Edwards has asked for in section on page
 
01:51:29.209 --> 01:51:29.219 align:start position:0%
four in section or set lines 10 through
 
01:51:29.219 --> 01:51:31.430 align:start position:0%
four in section or set lines 10 through
12.

01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
12.
 
01:51:33.709 --> 01:51:33.719 align:start position:0%
yeah she he wanted that to go back to
 
01:51:37.310 --> 01:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
where we allow the the um
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
the agency after the to proceed with the
 
01:51:44.330 --> 01:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh report from the commission
 
01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:48.410 align:start position:0%
uh report from the commission
so

01:51:48.410 --> 01:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:50.209 --> 01:51:50.219 align:start position:0%
all right so I guess it's zero seven
 
01:51:51.950 --> 01:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
four six we're going to post which isn't
 
01:51:53.810 --> 01:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
there already in zero seven five seven
 
01:51:56.689 --> 01:51:56.699 align:start position:0%
after it's corrected
 
01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.689 --> 01:52:05.699 align:start position:0%
four six I think I mentioned that yes
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair representative erf
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
so just for clarification understand
 
01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:13.850 align:start position:0%
so just for clarification understand
where

01:52:13.850 --> 01:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:52:17.149 --> 01:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
zero seven five seven came from as I
 
01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
recall when division one and division
 
01:52:21.530 --> 01:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
three met jointly
 
01:52:23.410 --> 01:52:23.420 align:start position:0%
um a vote was taking place of some sort
 
01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:25.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering what was is this what
 
01:52:27.290 --> 01:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
we voted is this what was voted on that
 
01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
day or is this something else
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
this this is 96 of that with the changes
 
01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
proposed by the governor that I I
 
01:52:39.169 --> 01:52:39.179 align:start position:0%
referred to earlier about different
 
01:52:41.090 --> 01:52:41.100 align:start position:0%
language around
 
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
um protecting the Gopher money and on
 
01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
the final who would make the decision so
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
those two components are different from
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
the 10-5 straw poll that division one
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
and three took follow-up
 
01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up so and I'll just make a
 
01:52:59.149 --> 01:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
comment it doesn't need to be a question
 
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
but it appears that taking taking that
 
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
those changes into this in conjunction
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
with the earlier Amendment we heard
 
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
about the 0738 that if I'm not mistaken
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's basically what division one and
 
01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
division three looked at and can vote it
 
01:53:15.169 --> 01:53:15.179 align:start position:0%
out of sort of voted out of whatever
 
01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
that was a couple weeks ago and just for
 
01:53:20.570 --> 01:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
information for the committee this new
 
01:53:24.109 --> 01:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment zero seven four six is exactly
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
what came out of
 
01:53:28.250 --> 01:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
that division one division three meeting
 
01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
several weeks ago with changes so just
 
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
to understand that the basis of zero
 
01:53:37.370 --> 01:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
seven four six is identical to what the
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
division and division three division one
 
01:53:40.490 --> 01:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
and three people looked at with
 
01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
additional changes to it but in terms of
 
01:53:44.689 --> 01:53:44.699 align:start position:0%
the underlying everything the money is
 
01:53:46.850 --> 01:53:46.860 align:start position:0%
back in is in here there's some other
 
01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
changes about it I guess I won't go into
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
today we'll wait for the till next week
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
but you can other than the changes that
 
01:53:52.669 --> 01:53:52.679 align:start position:0%
are in here is identical to what came
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
out of division one division three a few
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
weeks back
 
01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
clarification on the clarification
 
01:54:03.290 --> 01:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
on your page six of that Amendment it
 
01:54:06.109 --> 01:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
the changes of the criminal code are
 
01:54:07.490 --> 01:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
included there
 
01:54:11.149 --> 01:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
and and I believe you subsequently had a
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
conversation with the representative
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
Lynn who suggested some tweaks to that
 
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
language so so while it's very close to
 
01:54:22.729 --> 01:54:22.739 align:start position:0%
what got discussed in that joint
 
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
division one and three work session it's
 
01:54:29.890 --> 01:54:29.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
that is not what I said
 
01:54:34.729 --> 01:54:34.739 align:start position:0%
what I said was
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
the basis of zero seven four six is
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
identical to what was voted out of
 
01:54:44.810 --> 01:54:44.820 align:start position:0%
division one division three what I see
 
01:54:47.290 --> 01:54:47.300 align:start position:0%
in these other two pieces
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
738 and 757 are components of that but
 
01:54:56.209 --> 01:54:56.219 align:start position:0%
they are also not identical to that
 
01:54:58.370 --> 01:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
and we sort of touched on some changes
 
01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
apparently but not everything I thought
 
01:55:02.510 --> 01:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
we were not yet discussing the seven
 
01:55:04.910 --> 01:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
four six today because you want to wait
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
till after the Germaine hearing the
 
01:55:09.709 --> 01:55:09.719 align:start position:0%
non-germaine hearing so yes you're right
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
there there are changes in here a number
 
01:55:14.330 --> 01:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
of them for sure and the I will discuss
 
01:55:16.129 --> 01:55:16.139 align:start position:0%
those we will discuss those at whatever
 
01:55:21.649 --> 01:55:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative Hull thank you Mr
 
01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:25.010 align:start position:0%
representative Hull thank you Mr
chairman

01:55:25.010 --> 01:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:55:27.290 --> 01:55:27.300 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the comments
 
01:55:29.629 --> 01:55:29.639 align:start position:0%
um from the member from the Gopher
 
01:55:31.609 --> 01:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
committee is it possible to ask for the
 
01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to weigh in on use of
 
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
arpa funds because at some point if this
 
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
state has to defend that this is not
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
about the go for committee making a
 
01:55:43.129 --> 01:55:43.139 align:start position:0%
recommendation it truly would be the AG
 
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
having to defend that action in court
 
01:55:48.530 --> 01:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
and knowing of several lawsuits across
 
01:55:51.050 --> 01:55:51.060 align:start position:0%
the country right now on this I would
 
01:55:53.689 --> 01:55:53.699 align:start position:0%
want their opinion on this more so than
 
01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
a committee
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
I will see if we can get that opinion
 
01:56:01.250 --> 01:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's anybody here from
 
01:56:03.770 --> 01:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
the attorney general
 
01:56:06.530 --> 01:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
no one seems to volunteer that so we'll
 
01:56:11.450 --> 01:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:16.490 --> 01:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:19.609 --> 01:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt uh I I just want
 
01:56:22.970 --> 01:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
to add that probably at some point we're
 
01:56:26.209 --> 01:56:26.219 align:start position:0%
going to come to a conclusion and if we
 
01:56:28.129 --> 01:56:28.139 align:start position:0%
come to con a conclusion it's going to
 
01:56:31.129 --> 01:56:31.139 align:start position:0%
be one bill we can't vote to adopt all
 
01:56:33.050 --> 01:56:33.060 align:start position:0%
of these in all of these amendments and
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
previous bills that haven't amounted to
 
01:56:39.050 --> 01:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
a hell of beans we need to have a
 
01:56:41.209 --> 01:56:41.219 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Bill and it has to be
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
something that can be enacted one of the
 
01:56:48.050 --> 01:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
things that I have noticed is that in
 
01:56:51.290 --> 01:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
terms of the funding there's been
 
01:56:53.629 --> 01:56:53.639 align:start position:0%
there's been talk around around the
 
01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:57.679 align:start position:0%
around the uh lob here about
 
01:57:00.129 --> 01:57:00.139 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking in the state either the
 
01:57:04.609 --> 01:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
Missouri Missouri or Mississippi has
 
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
been sued concerning this but they're
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
talking about the ultimate uh the
 
01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:12.310 align:start position:0%
talking about the ultimate uh the
ultimate

01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
ultimate
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
ability of the state to actually spend
 
01:57:18.290 --> 01:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
the money one of the things I noticed in
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
at least one of these amendments is a is
 
01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
a statement of the money being expended
 
01:57:26.270 --> 01:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
but if it if it turns out that it can't
 
01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
be something else is going to happen
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's one of the ways you get around uh
 
01:57:34.430 --> 01:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
all these uh these lawsuits that are
 
01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
filed all over the country which which
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
many of them probably don't have a don't
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
have a chance in in Hell of getting
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
getting a
 
01:57:47.089 --> 01:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
getting a positive result so I think
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
that we can we can proceed with
 
01:57:52.250 --> 01:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
analyzing the information we have in
 
01:57:54.910 --> 01:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
front of us and coming to a conclusion
 
01:57:58.010 --> 01:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh as to what ought to be presented to
 
01:58:01.149 --> 01:58:01.159 align:start position:0%
the to the to the legislature as a whole
 
01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh rather than just debate amongst the
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
Amendments such and such Amendment so
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
and so let's just get out get all our
 
01:58:13.370 --> 01:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
our eggs in one basket here and decide
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
what to do and then we can take the
 
01:58:18.109 --> 01:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
necessary steps to put the the exact
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
document that the legislature wants out
 
01:58:24.169 --> 01:58:24.179 align:start position:0%
so that it can be voted on are you
 
01:58:26.089 --> 01:58:26.099 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we try to have OLS put
 
01:58:28.189 --> 01:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
it into one document
 
01:58:32.089 --> 01:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
I was thinking about that actually Mr
 
01:58:32.099 --> 01:58:33.649 align:start position:0%
I was thinking about that actually Mr
chairman

01:58:33.649 --> 01:58:33.659 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:39.890 --> 01:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
Mr chairs isn't that why we were going
 
01:58:43.250 --> 01:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
to release the Mr Ripple's reply
 
01:58:47.209 --> 01:58:47.219 align:start position:0%
what do you think of asking the OLS to
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
combine the parts of this that are the
 
01:58:53.089 --> 01:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
same into one Amendment separating it by
 
01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
section one section two and so on and
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
then we can vote separately on the
 
01:58:57.119 --> 01:59:02.870 align:start position:0%
then we can vote separately on the
sections

01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:05.209 align:start position:0%
 
ice

01:59:05.209 --> 01:59:05.219 align:start position:0%
ice
 
01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
I I think you could definitely do that
 
01:59:12.530 --> 01:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.510 --> 01:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
I think that would work I'm not sure if
 
01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%
they should all be listed as
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
non-germaine amendments for the
 
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
upcoming hearing next week
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
I'm really not sure how that would be
 
01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:24.300 align:start position:0%
noticed but it could definitely be
 
01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
definitely be done they could be broken
 
01:59:27.770 --> 01:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
out into individual amendments yeah I
 
01:59:29.570 --> 01:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
think if if we
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
it seems to be a a need to see one
 
01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:33.470 align:start position:0%
it seems to be a a need to see one
document

01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
because Raven go back and forth well
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
that's the same in this one same in that
 
01:59:38.990 --> 01:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
one if if they're all if there's
 
01:59:40.669 --> 01:59:40.679 align:start position:0%
sections that are the similar that can
 
01:59:43.010 --> 01:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
be combined so we don't have to keep
 
01:59:45.550 --> 01:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
looking back and forth and we can just
 
01:59:48.290 --> 01:59:48.300 align:start position:0%
obviously one will say
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
here's we're going ahead with funding
 
01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
the second one will will say something
 
01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
to the effect that you know these are
 
01:59:55.850 --> 01:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
the things that need to be incorporated
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
in in the building and the other one
 
02:00:00.350 --> 02:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
will say here's the things that need to
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
change in the uh the reasons to uh
 
02:00:08.330 --> 02:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
incarcerate people so we put them in
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
like section one section two section
 
02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
three I would propose that we vote on
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
them separately and whatever survives
 
02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:17.820 align:start position:0%
with them with the majority vote will go
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
forward the ones that do not survive
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
those sections may be eliminated
 
02:00:25.310 --> 02:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
so so just to be clear so you you're
 
02:00:27.290 --> 02:00:27.300 align:start position:0%
requesting only one Amendment but you
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
want the individual components broken
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
out separately within that Amendment yes
 
02:00:33.169 --> 02:00:33.179 align:start position:0%
and things that are common in the
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
different amendments could be in the
 
02:00:37.010 --> 02:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
separate sections okay where they're
 
02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:39.350 align:start position:0%
separate sections okay where they're
common

02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:42.109 --> 02:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
for the representative Earth
 
02:00:45.169 --> 02:00:45.179 align:start position:0%
so I would just point out
 
02:00:49.250 --> 02:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
that 746 is that single amendment that
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
contains everything that's in
 
02:00:52.609 --> 02:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
the thing that came out of division one
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
and three
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
and the these other two pieces are
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
components of that as well
 
02:00:59.689 --> 02:00:59.699 align:start position:0%
and then there are changes
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
and if you do what you just suggested
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't think you'll pass anything
 
02:01:08.930 --> 02:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
out of committee because 746 is intended
 
02:01:09.770 --> 02:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
a hole that will capture the appropriate
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
sense of the house as to what the house
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
believes should be
 
02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:20.810 align:start position:0%
believes should be
come

02:01:20.810 --> 02:01:20.820 align:start position:0%
come
 
02:01:24.410 --> 02:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
the continuation of the sununu bill and
 
02:01:26.209 --> 02:01:26.219 align:start position:0%
yes it does go beyond
 
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
what was in what came out of division
 
02:01:29.810 --> 02:01:29.820 align:start position:0%
one and three specifically with regard
 
02:01:31.729 --> 02:01:31.739 align:start position:0%
to the change of law but that's only a
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
component of what is in there we passed
 
02:01:37.370 --> 02:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
a thing called HB 254 out of the house
 
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
last year twice
 
02:01:42.169 --> 02:01:42.179 align:start position:0%
and that is what we've well maybe we
 
02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
haven't all heard but most of us have
 
02:01:45.169 --> 02:01:45.179 align:start position:0%
heard that that was what died in
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
committee last year with the Senate so
 
02:01:47.870 --> 02:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
for those that haven't heard now you
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
haven't had that as well
 
02:01:52.669 --> 02:01:52.679 align:start position:0%
and it's important that it be considered
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
as a whole that changes to the law in
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the zenunda center
 
02:01:59.930 --> 02:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
because the changes to the law relate
 
02:02:03.169 --> 02:02:03.179 align:start position:0%
directly to the kind of minors that
 
02:02:05.689 --> 02:02:05.699 align:start position:0%
should be incarcerated well either
 
02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
detained or committed at the sununa
 
02:02:10.729 --> 02:02:10.739 align:start position:0%
center so I would suggest if you want to
 
02:02:12.910 --> 02:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
have two versions
 
02:02:17.209 --> 02:02:17.219 align:start position:0%
you have 746 as one and that could mean
 
02:02:19.370 --> 02:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
like the second version and then you go
 
02:02:21.290 --> 02:02:21.300 align:start position:0%
back to what came out of division what
 
02:02:23.810 --> 02:02:23.820 align:start position:0%
division division ones and threes and
 
02:02:25.370 --> 02:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
then have representative Edwards add in
 
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
the changes that he put into the two
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
pieces that he has here so then that's a
 
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
unified version
 
02:02:33.770 --> 02:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
and you had two unified versions to
 
02:02:38.750 --> 02:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
can both get together with Mr Ripple and
 
02:02:43.729 --> 02:02:43.739 align:start position:0%
the OLS and try to work this out and
 
02:02:46.189 --> 02:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
bring us something that will be isolated
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
because I see there are Parts like
 
02:02:50.689 --> 02:02:50.699 align:start position:0%
section five in your bill might be
 
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
section one in one of the other bills so
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
I just want to separate them out where
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
it's very obvious are we approving the
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
construction are we approving this the
 
02:03:01.490 --> 02:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
way it's used are we approving who can
 
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
go there so I see them as three separate
 
02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:05.750 align:start position:0%
go there so I see them as three separate
things

02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:07.030 align:start position:0%
things
question

02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:10.860 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I just would want to remind
 
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
folks that HP 254 was last term that was
 
02:03:18.530 --> 02:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
a different house that house has been
 
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
dissolved that doesn't exist
 
02:03:23.689 --> 02:03:23.699 align:start position:0%
the criminal code changes they're being
 
02:03:27.530 --> 02:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
brought to finance at the 11th Hour have
 
02:03:29.770 --> 02:03:29.780 align:start position:0%
not been heard anywhere in this house
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's being brought into the finance
 
02:03:35.450 --> 02:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
committee at the last moment and that's
 
02:03:38.990 --> 02:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
why this is non-germaine I I I think
 
02:03:40.970 --> 02:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
given that we have
 
02:03:43.609 --> 02:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
a budget that we need to do in the next
 
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
few weeks that we ought to stick to our
 
02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
knitting which is let's do the finance
 
02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
things and either of my amendments will
 
02:03:54.649 --> 02:03:54.659 align:start position:0%
do the finance things and let and then
 
02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
we can we can turn the rest of this over
 
02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:57.790 align:start position:0%
we can we can turn the rest of this over
to

02:03:57.790 --> 02:03:57.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:04:01.070 --> 02:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
criminal and family law they've retained
 
02:04:04.629 --> 02:04:04.639 align:start position:0%
House Bill 120 and they can
 
02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
include their consideration on the
 
02:04:09.649 --> 02:04:09.659 align:start position:0%
criminal code changes in in due course
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
rather than us trying to jam a
 
02:04:14.450 --> 02:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
non-germaine Amendment through into a
 
02:04:16.970 --> 02:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
that will be the discussion for a week
 
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
representative Hull for a question
 
02:04:27.890 --> 02:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so looking at the
 
02:04:30.410 --> 02:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
various versions in front of us in
 
02:04:31.850 --> 02:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
particular the section labeled
 
02:04:31.860 --> 02:04:33.709 align:start position:0%
particular the section labeled
appropriation

02:04:33.709 --> 02:04:33.719 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
02:04:39.709 --> 02:04:39.719 align:start position:0%
which is Section Five in hold on in 746
 
02:04:42.770 --> 02:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
and it's Section 1 in 738 and I don't
 
02:04:44.510 --> 02:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
know where it is in the other one
 
02:04:46.250 --> 02:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
the language in the appropriation
 
02:04:49.609 --> 02:04:49.619 align:start position:0%
section changes into representative who
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's come in earlier right about they
 
02:04:55.729 --> 02:04:55.739 align:start position:0%
may use these funds and if they can't
 
02:04:57.950 --> 02:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
use type language they should be pulled
 
02:04:59.689 --> 02:04:59.699 align:start position:0%
from General funds
 
02:05:02.330 --> 02:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not the attorney here but whichever
 
02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
one is the best version of those various
 
02:05:07.310 --> 02:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
appropriation sections relative to the
 
02:05:09.890 --> 02:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
management of the arpa funds and I leave
 
02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
that to people who know the law better
 
02:05:12.589 --> 02:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
than I do
 
02:05:14.750 --> 02:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
let's put that in there because it looks
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
like the latest version references
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
statute part of sb1 that passed into law
 
02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
and the older version was in reference
 
02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
to where we were when we were working on
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
this a couple weeks ago
 
02:05:27.890 --> 02:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the right one is but
 
02:05:30.290 --> 02:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
whatever the appropriate appropriation
 
02:05:32.330 --> 02:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
language let's get that into this
 
02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:34.850 align:start position:0%
language let's get that into this
version

02:05:34.850 --> 02:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:37.729 --> 02:05:37.739 align:start position:0%
you're all invited to attend with with
 
02:05:39.169 --> 02:05:39.179 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
that want to have some input to OLS
 
02:05:45.410 --> 02:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
they have very small cubicles but I'm
 
02:05:47.089 --> 02:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
sure they can make an arrangement maybe
 
02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:50.219 align:start position:0%
we can meet them somewhere else but to
 
02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
get something cogent that is separate
 
02:05:56.689 --> 02:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
sections because I believe there are
 
02:05:59.089 --> 02:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
agreement on some sections but not all
 
02:06:00.290 --> 02:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
of them
 
02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:02.450 align:start position:0%
of them
further

02:06:02.450 --> 02:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
this reminds me of a committee of
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
conference and I bite my tongue when I
 
02:06:08.930 --> 02:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
say that but is there a way to have a
 
02:06:13.010 --> 02:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
a versus B versus C comparison
 
02:06:15.169 --> 02:06:15.179 align:start position:0%
um Excel file that kind of highlights
 
02:06:17.209 --> 02:06:17.219 align:start position:0%
the differences between them so we can
 
02:06:18.589 --> 02:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
track it
 
02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple there are multiple amendments
 
02:06:22.609 --> 02:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
we can do a side by side comparing the
 
02:06:24.770 --> 02:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
Amendments yes
 
02:06:26.990 --> 02:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:30.109 --> 02:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
further on this question
 
02:06:32.570 --> 02:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
all right before they work in the
 
02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:33.830 align:start position:0%
all right before they work in the
afternoon

02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
division one are you having a meeting
 
02:06:39.530 --> 02:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
one o'clock for division one and you
 
02:06:43.729 --> 02:06:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:45.950 --> 02:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
work session on the budget in division
 
02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:47.330 align:start position:0%
work session on the budget in division
one

02:06:47.330 --> 02:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:06:49.850 --> 02:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
District Two one o'clock
 
02:06:51.709 --> 02:06:51.719 align:start position:0%
work session on the budget division
 
02:06:51.719 --> 02:06:52.729 align:start position:0%
work session on the budget division
three

02:06:52.729 --> 02:06:52.739 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh we're gonna do some of that but we
 
02:06:57.410 --> 02:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
also have four specific bills that have
 
02:06:59.689 --> 02:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
been put into the calendar
 
02:07:01.790 --> 02:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
and you will have they been advertised
 
02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
that you will meet with them this
 
02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:04.370 align:start position:0%
that you will meet with them this
afternoon

02:07:04.370 --> 02:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
02:07:07.129 --> 02:07:07.139 align:start position:0%
yes and they're posted very good and I
 
02:07:08.209 --> 02:07:08.219 align:start position:0%
would just point out that that's at two
 
02:07:10.370 --> 02:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
o'clock not one that's division three
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
two o'clock for division three Okay so
 
02:07:16.129 --> 02:07:16.139 align:start position:0%
if you all want to go and have a meeting
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
now or or ask Mr Ripple I will try to
