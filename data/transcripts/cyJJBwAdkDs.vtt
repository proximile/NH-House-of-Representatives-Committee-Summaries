00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
we will get started um I just wanted to
 
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
say I'm I'm planning to try to start all
 
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
of our meetings right on time okay
 
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
because because um it it it works a lot
 
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
more smoothly if if we're all here and
 
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
we're all on time and keep to the clock
 
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 align:start position:0%
and and that sort of thing um and I'm
 
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
also planning to have us have an hour
 
00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 align:start position:0%
and 15 minutes for lunch in general
 
00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
because because sometimes an hour is a
 
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 align:start position:0%
little you know it's a little tight but
 
00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately representative rung uh
 
00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 align:start position:0%
has pneumonia so we're hoping to see her
 
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
next week but um she's she's on
 
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
antibiotics and stuff so she won't be
 
00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
here today all right and so today we
 
00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
have with us um our so we're such a good
 
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
such an important division we don't have
 
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
just one LBA assistant we have two right
 
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
because if you looked at that list of um
 
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
Personnel we have um in our division in
 
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
our uh
 
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
agencies um half more than half I guess
 
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
of the employees of of the state right
 
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
so uh so this is you know there's a lot
 
00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 align:start position:0%
of a lot of agencies we have to deal
 
00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
with you know they're they're on the
 
00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 align:start position:0%
smaller side but um but they're all
 
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
quite important um so I'll introduce um
 
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
our our sort of senior assistant is
 
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
Melissa Rollins and uh Jack Mullen just
 
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
just joined us this year and so one of
 
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
the most important pieces of paper in
 
00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
this booklet is this second page which
 
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
will tell you which
 
00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 align:start position:0%
agencies each one is responsible for
 
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
right so this is something I never got
 
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
straight last time so uh so this is a
 
00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 align:start position:0%
really good list right and so um and
 
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
they're authorized if you have any
 
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
questions about any agencies or want to
 
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
contact somebody in an agency they will
 
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
help you out you don't have to go
 
00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
through me to to get to them right so
 
00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll help you out as you need
 
00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
it and with that Melissa is going to get
 
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon division one and welcome
 
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
welcome new members and it's good to see
 
00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 align:start position:0%
you guys again happy to be here um I
 
00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 align:start position:0%
think representative Maguire took some
 
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
of my presentation so that's great less
 
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
for me to say less for you to have to
 
00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
listen to me speak to um most of you
 
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
here are familiar with me I have been
 
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
with the LBA for three years now I
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
previously came from Department of
 
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue where I spent most of my Adult
 
00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
Career there um I landed as a senior
 
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
financial analyst my last several years
 
00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
there I worked mostly with Ways and
 
00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 align:start position:0%
Means at that time so I was on the
 
00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
revenue side of Staff projecting
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
estimates um and living in that world so
 
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
it's been interesting to swing over here
 
00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
the last three years to see now how the
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
state spends the money in the budgeting
 
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
side of things um as representative
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
Maguire stated we have Jack Mullen now
 
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
who is part of our team you don't see
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
Mike Hoffman here he did retire however
 
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
he will be helping us in February sort
 
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
of in the background with any additional
 
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh workload that we might need so it'll
 
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
be good to have him back um Jack I'll
 
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
let you introduce yourself and talk
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
about where you came from so my name is
 
00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
Jack Mullen I previously worked in the
 
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
Senate clerk's office for the past 10
 
00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 align:start position:0%
years so I have a little different
 
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
perspective of the process so it's going
 
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
to be fun to help you guys and learn
 
00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
with you guys through this budget
 
00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
process this
 
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
year we're very excited to have Jack so
 
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
some of this presentation before I start
 
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
I did steal from Mike KES just because I
 
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
saw thought there was some overlap as
 
00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 align:start position:0%
well as him giving 92 pages I didn't
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
know where this document would end up
 
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
for you guys like he said as a coaster
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
holding the door open extra reading
 
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
materials so ours is skimmed down to be
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
a third of that uh with some additional
 
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
information there but some of this might
 
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
be a little bit repetitive is just our
 
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
office it has the new emails we did hand
 
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 align:start position:0%
out our card because I don't believe
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
these new emails are effective until
 
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
next week and if there's any issues feel
 
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
free to use our old emails because I
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
believe those are going to be active for
 
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
a while so they will forward over but I
 
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure you had both
 
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
ways to contact us in case the new one
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't work or there's some hiccups
 
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 align:start position:0%
along the
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
way on the second page as representative
 
00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
Maguire alluded to you have two of us in
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
here uh Jack and I do have distinct job
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
duties within this group uh
 
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
Jack is taking over what I pre
 
00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 align:start position:0%
previously did which was the General
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
government in category one which will'll
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
go over on the next page I have taken
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
over what Mike Hoffman did which was
 
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
Category 2 and three we also have Mickey
 
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
landan who does category uh oh excuse me
 
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
who does division two which is safety
 
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
and education fish and game and then
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
Kevin does uh Department of Health and
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
Human Services in division 3 we do have
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
a lot of agencies which is why you do
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
have two analysts in here there's a lot
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
to cover um a lot to get through but
 
00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 align:start position:0%
we'll help make sure that we're tackling
 
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
all of those agencies and staying on
 
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
track for the
 
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
timeline so as I alluded to if you turn
 
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
page it's just the the division of work
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
between Jack and I is not just randomly
 
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
divided there are different categories
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
mik Kane spoke about them but I was
 
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
going to go over them as well so
 
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
division one is General government those
 
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
are your bigger agencies like
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
Services uh Department of State Treasury
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
oplc and then it switches over to
 
00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:10.759 align:start position:0%
category two and three which is what I
 
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
will be handling which is your category
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
two is Administrative Justice and public
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
protection and then category three is
 
00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:19.479 align:start position:0%
resource protection and development and
 
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
you can see the agencies within each of
 
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
those different categories it has below
 
00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
each category how the division is broken
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
up for within the departments or some of
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
the administratively attached agencies
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
to each of the Departments but this is a
 
00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:36.879 align:start position:0%
good resource guide just to know when we
 
00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:39.639 align:start position:0%
start talking about categories or what
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
agencies do I handle that because I
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
don't see it on the first page of the
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
big overarching departments but it's a
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
good reference guide to see what
 
00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
agencies you are responsible for I do
 
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
want to note too that although Jack and
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
I have distinct agencies we do work well
 
00:07:58.589 --> 00:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
together if you're like I don't remember
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
who's handling what but feel free to
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
email whoever you want throw us both on
 
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
the email we'll get the email to the
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate person or answer if needed
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
we'll both be in here quite a bit
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
together we'll be hearing this
 
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
information uh so don't feel like you
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
can email um Jack or you can't email me
 
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
on a certain specific topic we will get
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
it to each other and we'll make sure
 
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
we're providing you the best service
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
without a delay of who does
 
00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
what if you turn to the next page so you
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
probably got the not already next week
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
we will start be start to hear some
 
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:35.240 align:start position:0%
bills I think believe next Thursday full
 
00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:38.039 align:start position:0%
Finance we'll have four bills I wanted
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
to bring in a couple of examples for a
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
fiscal note we made some minor changes
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
but I also just wanted to talk about
 
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
Appropriations versus expenditures there
 
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
were some questions that came up over
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years and maybe some
 
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
misinterpretations of how the bills are
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
written and how that works you may
 
00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
already know this if you do feel free
 
00:08:59.710 --> 00:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
not to listen but I did want to just
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
point it out so we can make sure we're
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
providing you with the most accurate
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
information so the the one biggest
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
change with our fiscal note it doesn't
 
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
look exactly like this this is just a
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
sample but up top you'll see after
 
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal uh impact there is a statement
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
for this example bill that I threw
 
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
together it says this bill does this
 
00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
bill does provide funding it should have
 
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
said not sorry about that of course
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
first issue I'm sure there'll be a
 
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
couple of those uh this bill does not
 
00:09:34.069 --> 00:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
provide funding nor does it authorize
 
00:09:34.079 --> 00:09:35.470 align:start position:0%
provide funding nor does it authorize
new

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
positions so we thought if we called
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
that out in the beginning there may be
 
00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
less confusion about does it provide
 
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
funding I see a number in the
 
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
expenditure line so we're giving the
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
agency this money or the agency says
 
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
they need positions so we're giving
 
00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:53.079 align:start position:0%
those them those positions just because
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
an agency States they need x amount of
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
positions or they State this bill will
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
cost x amount of does not mean they're
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
authorized to use that funding or to
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
hire for those positions so in this
 
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
example that I gave you you'll see the
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
expenditure line says 500,000 for each
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
for 26 and 27 and in DET terminable for
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
28 the next line that you really want to
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
pay attention to is that appropriation
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
line so the appropriation line in this
 
00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:26.519 align:start position:0%
bill is zero which means there is no
 
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
authorization for that agency to have
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
that funding that is strictly the cost
 
00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
of what the agency or the LBA has
 
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
determined what the bill will cost for
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
them to uh
 
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
Implement so just something to be aware
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
of because what that means is if this
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass the agency is required
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
to stand up that program however they
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
may not be able to do it because they
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
don't have the funding or they don't
 
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
have the positions to do it they are not
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
authorized to spend an additional
 
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
$500,000 they won't have that those
 
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
dollars in their budget so just an an
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
important concept because the bulk of
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
our bills that do come down that we will
 
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
see in finance will have an expenditure
 
00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
line but they will not have an
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation for that those
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
expenditures and that can be okay
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes because the legislature this
 
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
division could say I think you could
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
absorb that into your budget or I think
 
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
you could shift resources to do it so we
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
are not going to provide the funding
 
00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:26.519 align:start position:0%
however on some of these big programs
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
you may want to make an amendment to add
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
an approv ration to it or you may want
 
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
to hold the bill retain the bill study
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
the bill or kill the bill because they
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
won't have the proper funding to stand
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
up and do what um what is authorized of
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
them in the bill so I just wanted to
 
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
point that out we have little asterisks
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
down there as well on the fiscal note
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
now that says expenditure is cost of
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
Bill appropriation is authorization to
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
fund cost of
 
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.629 align:start position:0%
fund cost of
Bill

00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
questions no well let me make clear so
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
when you say does not provide funding
 
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
you mean that the Appropriations line is
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
zero correct is that right corre because
 
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
when I first read it I thought well that
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
means the revenue line is zero but
 
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
that's not true that's not true okay so
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
the only does not provide funding would
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
only be in terms of covering
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
expenditures that's what we mean when it
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
funding so if you flip to the second
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
page this is just showing you that exact
 
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
same example except you'll notice up top
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
for fiscal impact it says this bill does
 
00:12:39.629 --> 00:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
not authorize new positions but it
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about the funding
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
and that's because if you go down to the
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
appropriation line you will see that
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
there is an appropriation or
 
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
authorization for the agent agency to
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
have and spend
 
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
$500,000 out of General funds in 26 and
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
in 27 however the agency still does
 
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:01.959 align:start position:0%
state that they need uh I think two
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts is what I put in
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
there but they don't have authorization
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
to fill those positions so just an sort
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
of a overview and just something to look
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
at when we're getting these bills and
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
we're like we can't spend this but are
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
we actually spending it or is it just an
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
expent that that the agency
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
States Representative Ms thanks Mr
 
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
chairman so I guess I'm that one
 
00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
confuses me that they they've so they're
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
saying that these new positions is going
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
to are going to cost
 
00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:34.519 align:start position:0%
$500,000 there's authorization to spend
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
$500,000 but they can't spend it because
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
they can't hire the
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
positions partly correct so it does say
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
that it's as well as for new office
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
space equipment as the cost so
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
essentially they could get the office
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
space and they could get the equipment
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
but yes you are correct they have funds
 
00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:52.839 align:start position:0%
or dollars now for a position but the
 
00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
position cannot be established because
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
that has to be authorized by the
 
00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:58.519 align:start position:0%
legislature in the bill so there if you
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to give them that $500,000 and
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
these bills do come through like this
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
where they're a little bit deficient in
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
what is actually needed and it could
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
have been that the sponsor didn't
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
realize they needed additional positions
 
00:14:12.509 --> 00:14:12.519 align:start position:0%
until after the um after the fiscal note
 
00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:13.389 align:start position:0%
until after the um after the fiscal note
came

00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
came
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
out but there could be an amendment if
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
you felt that $500,000 per year was
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate and you wanted to pass this
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
bill you could do an amendment which
 
00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:22.759 align:start position:0%
Jack and I could prepare to give
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
authorization to hire two new positions
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
so sorry so anytime um any time there's
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
a new POS a an agency wants to hire a
 
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.790 align:start position:0%
a new POS a an agency wants to hire a
new

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
position they they have to get specific
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
authorization to hire those people it's
 
00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:40.759 align:start position:0%
not just spend the money they have to be
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
they have to get authorized to hire the
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
position that's correct okay thank you
 
00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:46.759 align:start position:0%
yeah we we control spending in sort of
 
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
two ways one is the dollar amount but
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
also there's an authorized number of
 
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
employees and so if that doesn't grow
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
that tends to keep the dollar amount
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
lower yes representative evil yeah I
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
mean just slightly more nuanced
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative Ms is that the budget has
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
to authorize the creation of a new
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
position and that position will have you
 
00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
know a
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
classification associated with it it's a
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
fairly detailed thing to create so you
 
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
don't just authorize the agency to hire
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
somebody it's a very specific
 
00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:25.030 align:start position:0%
somebody it's a very specific
statutory

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
authorization and again if you um needed
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
an amend for that we would help make
 
00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
sure that you have all the information
 
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
in there that is needed for the position
 
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
detail so moving from fiscal notes into
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
the operating budget process I wasn't
 
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
sure Mike Kane was going to go over this
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
he did go over this so it's a little bit
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
redundant but I I will just break it
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
down for division one purposes um as we
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
get those bills they are going to come
 
00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
in we will typically retain division one
 
00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:00.519 align:start position:0%
will retain the Bill if they feel they
 
00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
might do something with it until we're
 
00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:04.839 align:start position:0%
getting hb1 and hb2 and then we'll add
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
it on to hb2 I'm going to go over that
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
further in the presentation but just as
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
a high level of where we're at um like
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
Mike Kane said the agency phase started
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
a while ago before most of us were even
 
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
aware of it that was March through octo
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
October what's a little bit different
 
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
this time around versus um when the
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
members who this is their second uh
 
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
second session doing this was that
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
the same process occurred two years ago
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
however it was governor sununu's budget
 
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
then and he was the incoming Governor so
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
he was just sort of sliding that
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
responsibility over for him to do his
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
own Governor face budget in November and
 
00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
February this one's a little bit
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
different different as we are handing
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
off to a different Governor so um there
 
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
may be I say that because there may be
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
more significant changes than those of
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
you who attended the agency phase
 
00:16:57.959 --> 00:16:59.389 align:start position:0%
you who attended the agency phase
presentation

00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
I imagine they're going to look quite
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
different now as it's being handed off
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
to um Governor aot to
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
present so we will get that presentation
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
maybe somewhere between
 
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:14.919 align:start position:0%
um want to
 
00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
see let's actually we'll Turn the Page
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
just because we do have dates there um
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
we will get the
 
00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039 align:start position:0%
governor's presentation um or she'll
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
give it probably between the 12th and
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
the 13th as what we're guessing because
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
it has to be before that 15th which is
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
on a Saturday um and then she'll come
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
and her budget director will come to the
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
full finance and give the presentation
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
to the full Finance at that point our
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
committee work can begin on the budget I
 
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
looked back two years ago and it looks
 
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
like we did start hearing agencies that
 
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
day so we will start uh start our work
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
on that day at least getting the
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
agencies come because at that point they
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
will be able to talk about what is in
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
their budget we do have agencies
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
starting to be scheduled on the 22nd I
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
think we have a pretty full day that's
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
strictly for them to come over and come
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
and give an overview of their budget
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's more of like a training for some of
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
the new members it's uh can help jog our
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
memory of what they do how they work
 
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
what they're responsible for before they
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
come in for the budget because that can
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
be a lot to to remember especially with
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
so many agencies of learning what they
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
do what they handle and then also
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
talking about the budget all at the same
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
time can be a lot so that will be
 
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
helpful for us to get sort of our feet
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
on the ground understand what the
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
agencies look like but then they'll
 
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
they'll start coming in like I said
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
probably around that week the the week
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
of February 17th through the 20th we'll
 
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
start scheduling in these agencies to
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
come in and they'll come in and they'll
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
talk about their budget they'll talk
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
about what the governor gave them what
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
reductions they had and then they may
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
also have additional
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
requests we have about six weeks to get
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
through all of these agencies and that
 
00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:02.919 align:start position:0%
is hb1 and hb2 so as Mike Kane said hb1
 
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
is about 800 Pages we have a big chunk
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
of that to go through that we'll be
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
looking at budgets class lines um and
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
figuring out where changes need to be
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
and then we also have hb2 we don't know
 
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
what that's going to look like this year
 
00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
but that's also another large bill that
 
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
we have to get through simultaneously
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
with hb1 as Mr Kane stated we will be
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
getting hb2 a little bit sooner
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
typically before we try to get something
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office the LBA
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
office would go through and come up with
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
something for you guys to see but we NE
 
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
we didn't have the language for you so
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
it will be great to have the language in
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
front of us it will allow us to get
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
moving a little bit quicker before we
 
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
document Melissa just shut do you happen
 
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
to have a an extra one of these handouts
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
yep there's a pile right over there does
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
represent of vol me you need one or
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
you're all set okay I'm
 
00:19:59.789 --> 00:19:59.799 align:start position:0%
sorry okay very good
 
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
all I'm sorry continue yeah no
 
00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
problem um so we have about six weeks
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
the division work needs to be done
 
00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:09.799 align:start position:0%
probably around March 26th that's going
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
to be a pretty tight hard deadline for
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
us to get to and the reason that is a
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
little bit early is
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
because representative Maguire will need
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
to and possibly with representative
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
crails will need to present to full
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
Finance what divisions one did and that
 
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
will probably be somewhere between March
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
31st and the 2nd April 2nd because it
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
needs to be add of full Finance by April
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
3D so just saying it one more time so
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
it's all in the Calendars our deadline
 
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919 align:start position:0%
is probably about March 26th for
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
work and at that
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
point once the uh the house is all set
 
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
we stop here we switch gears and we go
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate and start working
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
with them so we're not as available
 
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:00.039 align:start position:0%
after that that point however we still
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
be we still will be over here in limited
 
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
capacity to hear bills but Senate does
 
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
point and you can turn the page to page
 
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
eight which is just Senate deadlines in
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
case again you needed it and just wanted
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
a uh small handout versus the big
 
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
handout of what Senate looks like and
 
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
then when uh Committee of conference
 
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.990 align:start position:0%
then when uh Committee of conference
occurs

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
occurs
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
which most of you well if you of you in
 
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
this room who have been in uh this is
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
your second term in finance did not get
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
to experience a committee of conference
 
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago so that will be a
 
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.430 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago so that will be a
new

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
experience all right we can go to page
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
nine again I didn't know Mike Kane was
 
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
going to cover this page in depth so I
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
think you have heard most of these I
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
just wanted to get this out here as a
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
good definition of what some of the
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
terms are for the new members of what
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
they look like when we speak to them but
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
also again just to have this hand out
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
with your stuff so when you're getting
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
the big hb1 which will be a binder um in
 
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
hb2 you can reference this if we're
 
00:22:12.029 --> 00:22:12.039 align:start position:0%
start using words or you look through
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
that document and you'll start to see
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
some of the you know accounting unit or
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
you'll see um Mike Kane's Surplus
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
statement you can kind of look back at
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
this and maybe not have to glance
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
through the 92 pages to find it so
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's in
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
there so moving on to page
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
10 I'll just interrupt and say I find
 
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
the Surplus statement to be hugely
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
useful that's something you definitely
 
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
want to learn how what's in it and and
 
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
how to read it
 
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
so I agree with you on that it's one of
 
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
the most important documents probably
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
that our office
 
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
creates so moving on to page
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
10 again for members who have been here
 
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
this looks familiar but I really wanted
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
to walk you through the process so
 
00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:58.039 align:start position:0%
you're familiar again with what the
 
00:22:59.549 --> 00:22:59.559 align:start position:0%
documents look like cuz I'm sure your
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
first session on here was maybe a
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
whirlwind of a representative Ms this is
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
going to be brand new to you but this is
 
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
what we compile so you're going to get
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
hb1 again 800 pages will have that tab
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
for you index for you and you're going
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
to start going through
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
and when the agencies come in they're
 
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
going to have requests Jack and I's job
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
is to keep track of all those requests
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
so we make sure we can add them to a
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
document so this document is just for
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
hb1 only and it keeps track of all the
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
additional not what's in the governor's
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
budget this is all the additional
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
requests that are coming from the agency
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
that the division has to decide on
 
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:45.039 align:start position:0%
whether to approve or not approve so
 
00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
this is the tracking sheet and you'll
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
become very familiar with this we will
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
have a new one updated for you every
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
time there's decisions made every time
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
there's changes made it's posted online
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
we post all our documents online
 
00:24:00.029 --> 00:24:00.039 align:start position:0%
typically before the meeting happens
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
we'll have it and we'll have copies for
 
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
you so this is going to be your document
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
to keep looking through it's more of a
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
highlevel document it doesn't break it
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
out by accounting unit or class code but
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
it does help keep track of where those
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
funds are what we're spending what's
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
approved what we didn't approve and to
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
get to the point that the whole entire
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
document is shaded because we have
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
requests representative M thank you um
 
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
so these additional requests are they
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
additional agency budget requests that
 
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
the governor has kind of gone along with
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
he's willing or she she would be willing
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
to support or is this the
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
agency's kind of wish list outside of
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
the governor's office so a little bit of
 
00:24:53.789 --> 00:24:53.799 align:start position:0%
a complicated answer right because I
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
don't exactly know I don't want to speak
 
00:24:57.549 --> 00:24:57.559 align:start position:0%
for the governor of whether she approved
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
these items or not these are the items
 
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
that did not make it into her budget why
 
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
they W won't make it into her budget
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
would be her choice sometimes it is
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
merely an oversight that it didn't get
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
put in there we have approved some of
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
those items where it should have been in
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
the budget and to make um make the
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
budget work properly you need this item
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
in there because maybe it accompanies
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
something that's in her hb2 but they
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
forgot to put the corresponding
 
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
expenditure into
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
hb1 sometimes it may not have been a
 
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
prioritization of the governor or a
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
priority of the governor so she may not
 
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
have wanted in there or sometimes it may
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
be something after the P after the fact
 
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
Because by the time the governor's
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
office is presenting this budget and by
 
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
the time it you know comes to us when
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
she's finalized that she's probably
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
finalized it well before February 15th
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
so something may have popped up that
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
needs to be implemented or put in here
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
um that the agency comes to us so
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of reasons I don't
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer on exactly which
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
ones come in but they are not in the
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
governor's budget these are all new
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
requests and sometimes a request is does
 
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
not necessarily mean it spends more
 
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
money right sometimes they want to shift
 
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
something from one place to another I
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
have an extra employee here I'd rather
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
have them here something's like that and
 
00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
those things go into the budget anyways
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
right because they affect money exactly
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
where it's spent and they change House
 
00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
Bill one so you know instead of spending
 
00:26:29.549 --> 00:26:29.559 align:start position:0%
in that column you're spending in this
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
column so some of these requests are
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
relatively easy to Grant because there
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
isn't a change in money this we expect
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
this budget uh bium to be very very
 
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
difficult revenues have been declining
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
Etc and so um we're going to be we're
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
going to have to be very ruthless with
 
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
approving requests for more money or
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
more Personnel um because any every one
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
of those we add we got to subtract even
 
00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
more from somebody else right so uh to
 
00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
make the budget balance so uh those kind
 
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
of requests are going to be very
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to to fund but of course
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
presumably there will be some because
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know that's a really important thing
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
and this thing over here is not quite so
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
important and you know that kind of
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
thing thank you that's a very good point
 
00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
ref end McGuire thank you for adding
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
that there are just simply transferring
 
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
class lines that need to come through
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
here because they have to have
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
authorization in hb1 to move One Fund to
 
00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:30.799 align:start position:0%
refunds from one class line to another
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
so from a travel expense into software
 
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
purchasing could be one it's a zero net
 
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
change but we do still have to put this
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
in here and sometimes if you look down
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
to the second approved item um that
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
one's put in there because there was a
 
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
keying error in the hb1 so of course
 
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
that would get approved because it needs
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:55.519 align:start position:0%
fixed so again this is the tracking
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
sheet change um will live in breathe of
 
00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.750 align:start position:0%
sheet change um will live in breathe of
this

00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
document so that's just did you have
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
what what's the graying out why so the
 
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
graying out is when we approve the item
 
00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:11.559 align:start position:0%
or make a decision so the grade out is
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
those sections have already been tackled
 
00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
so that's when I was saying you hope by
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
the or by the end of the session or by
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
the end of our due date the whole entire
 
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
uh sheet will be great out because we
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
have taken action on all of it whether
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
it is to approve it to deny it I see way
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
14 that was hb1 this is HB 2's tracking
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
sheet so once we receive hb2 Jack and I
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
are going to comb through that document
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
learn it we're going to put
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
together this spreadsheet for you that
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
says and identifies which sections
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
belong to division one there's a lot in
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
there that typically doesn't impact us
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's for other divisions to worry
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
about not for us to worry about so these
 
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
are just the sections that impact
 
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
division one we'll put the section
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
number in there the page number in there
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
so it's easy to reference what we're
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
talking about you'll have hb2 in front
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
of you you can flip back and
 
00:29:21.789 --> 00:29:21.799 align:start position:0%
forth you will need to make decisions as
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
a division what you want to do with
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
every single one of those items that
 
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
impact division one whether it's
 
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
accepting the item
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
you can turn the
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
page whether it's doing an amendment to
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
change what is an hb2 to reduce an
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
amount to increase amount whether it's
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
to delete a section that needs an
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
amendment whether we hold the item which
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
means we need to go we being Jack and I
 
00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
need to go back to the agency and get
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
some follow-up information before the
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
committee feels comfortable enough to
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
make a decision on that
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
item or or if you keep scrolling through
 
00:30:03.389 --> 00:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
to page 20 whether it's to add new
 
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
sections to hb2 so the pages
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
before page 20 were just making changes
 
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
to the current document page 20 was all
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
the new sections that we added into hb2
 
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
and that reverts back to what we were
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
previously talking about where will the
 
00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
division will retain bills and then add
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
those bills with Appropriations into
 
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
hb2 so if you look at the first one for
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
instance ads content of HB
 
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
374 you'll scroll down to you know a
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
couple down and you'll see ads content
 
00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.070 align:start position:0%
couple down and you'll see ads content
from

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
hp230 and a bulk of these are just
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
adding bills that the division has
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
retained but would like to see go forth
 
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.389 align:start position:0%
retained but would like to see go forth
in

00:30:51.389 --> 00:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
hb2 again with hb2 there are amend
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
amendments needed with anything that we
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
t change within that unless we approve
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
it no amendment is needed those
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
amendments will flow through Jack and I
 
00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
we work really closely with OS to get
 
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
those done and turned around pretty
 
00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
quickly uh it's much faster if they flow
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
through us so we do ask that they all
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
flow through us we can keep track of
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
them we keep track of the amendment
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
numbers on this sheet if you go outside
 
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
of us it makes it a little bit difficult
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
to figure out what's going where and we
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we don't miss anything
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
so again please float any amendments
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
through Jack and I
 
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and hp2 is a huge part of the time
 
00:31:34.509 --> 00:31:34.519 align:start position:0%
we spend on things because our section
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
is going to be so much larger than the
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
sections that other agent other
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
divisions deal with and so we'll tend to
 
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
um if we're meeting with an agency for
 
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
an hour and it only takes 45 minutes
 
00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:50.519 align:start position:0%
we'll stick 15 minutes of talking about
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
the next few sections of hp2 into that
 
00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
time so that you know we get things done
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
if you turn to the next page page
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
21 so we went over we're back on hb1 now
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
so we went over what the tracking sheets
 
00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:12.519 align:start position:0%
looked like for TW for hb1 this is the
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
final change for hb1 what it looks like
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
for this Division and this is what Jack
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
and I will compile for you this is
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
called the detailed change so this tells
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
you what accounting units were changed
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
what the impact is and then the comments
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
of why we changed it so this is
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
something that representative Maguire
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
will present to the Full House Finance
 
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
this is the document this is what was
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
used last year when represent or two
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
years ago when representative leishman
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
and representative Maguire presented
 
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
they will go through all the changes
 
00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:46.519 align:start position:0%
that have been approved to division one
 
00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
and you'll see a comment side on the
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
right so it can help remind you why we
 
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
document oh representative I did want to
 
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
point out because you did have that
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
question um you had the question about
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
doit and what that looks like and if you
 
00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.230 align:start position:0%
doit and what that looks like and if you
go

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
to page
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
22 at the
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
top you will see there it says it salary
 
00:33:18.159 --> 00:33:19.430 align:start position:0%
top you will see there it says it salary
and

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
benefits you'll see the statement of
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
funds is O which is other and then it
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
has an amount there and then it says two
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
new technical support
 
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
Specialists U for revenue for Dr if you
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
turn the page to line
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
49 of the next page you will see that
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
corresponding line for those positions
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
that come from the general fund so
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's where that that devil accounting
 
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
does happen so you're going to have the
 
00:33:53.629 --> 00:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
general fund receives the appropriation
 
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
or the authorization for that position
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
but then
 
00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:00.519 align:start position:0%
um you have to have the corresponding
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
line because that money does get
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
transferred to oit but it's an inter
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
agency transfer it's for the books just
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
to keep track of what
 
00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.950 align:start position:0%
to keep track of what
doit

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
doit
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
um how they're allocated their funds for
 
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.270 align:start position:0%
um how they're allocated their funds for
their

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
budget and I'm
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry another question um on page
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
21 uh I just want to make sure that I I
 
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
get the termin ology right so in the
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
column the what do each of those numbers
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
represent like 01 is that the what is
 
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
that is that the governmental unit or it
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
is the governmental unit and we have in
 
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
our notes from your presentation we're
 
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
going to send you um a link to
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
das's website they have a great manual
 
00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:52.599 align:start position:0%
that will break down all these and a
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
definition for every single code that's
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
helpful for you but it is the overall
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
government one then it has the agency
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
codee or the department code then it has
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
the agency code yeah that's what I
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to understand what so the O the O
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
if we could just 01 is the governmental
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
unit yep and then the O3 I'm looking at
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
line 11 03 represents the first 03
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
represents what the agency agency the
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
second 03 is Department it's also within
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
the agency so that number would change
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
um when we met the other day we talked
 
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
about administratively attached agencies
 
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so that number would change if it
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
was an administratively attached agency
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
right but because this is um it for
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
liquor it's the same those two are going
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
to be the same and then the six digigit
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
that's that's a combination of the
 
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
department and the agency code and the
 
00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
funding oh okay and then the 7677 that's
 
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
the accounting unit okay so that will
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
drill down to a specific part of the
 
00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.190 align:start position:0%
drill down to a specific part of the
agency

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
okay and then it e it does even go
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
further for us where there is a class
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
code at the end of that which will be
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
which will identify the specific expense
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay that it goes with whether it's
 
00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
office space or co uh Personnel cost or
 
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
benefits Etc but we will get you a
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
document that will help you understand
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
that a little bit better and if the
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
whole whole division would like it we
 
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
can also email it out it's a pretty big
 
00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
document but it does have thank you a
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
lot of items in it so again if you turn
 
00:36:28.829 --> 00:36:28.839 align:start position:0%
to page
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
24 you'll
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
see that this is what was done for
 
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
division one the total funds that were
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
spent um by the funding source and this
 
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
is just for division one category one
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
because we do break it out uh for
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
category the different categor sorry I'm
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid the Sun a little bit you
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
and then the next couple of pages I just
 
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to show you because we do Break
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
It Out by category we do have category
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
two this is what we did excluding safety
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
safety um it has the breakout of those
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
funds you'll notice when you get to
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
category two how much smaller the
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
general funds look like versus what they
 
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
look like for category one because as
 
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
you get into Category 2 and three you do
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
start to shift away from General funds
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
funds and then on page 28 that's
 
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
3 and then at the very end on page 29
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's a summary of everything combined
 
00:37:52.589 --> 00:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
from all the categories of what division
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
one did for uh whether it's a reduction
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
sources on page 30 we talked about
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
hb1 on page 30 the bulk of that is hb2
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
this is the final presentation again
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
that will be given by the division chair
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
to full
 
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
Finance it's a summary for them to go
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
through it will say what we did to hb1
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
or hb2 there's always typically a couple
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
of hb1 amendments um that do need to be
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
put in there whether there is an
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
abolished position the estimates of
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue always comes
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
through division one so that is always
 
00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
put into the
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
document and then in this case there was
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
a new hb1 where they put an
 
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation for a position for
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
that section is typically pretty
 
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.470 align:start position:0%
that section is typically pretty
small

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
hb2 when we went back to the other
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
document that I was going through this
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
is the finalized version so this will
 
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
have have the list of everything that
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
was changed deleted or added for hb2 it
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
goes from page 30 to
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
31 and within this packet we only put a
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
couple on here but within the packet
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
that goes that is presented in front of
 
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
full finance will be all of the
 
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
Amendments um however many is listed
 
00:39:20.589 --> 00:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
here you know 20 or so amendments behind
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
there so people can look at what was
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
done and talk about what is done and
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
Jack and I will coate this entire
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
document to have for full
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
Finance that's the end of the
 
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
presentation I have as the sun is
 
00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
aggressive do you want to explain page
 
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
32 what it
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
does I know what it does oh sorry I do
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
that yeah sure but not so page 32 it
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
looks a little weird you're like what is
 
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
any of this mean so we had a um we had
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
during the budget process
 
00:39:59.550 --> 00:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue received a couple
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
of positions and in order to receive
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
those we unfunded or um abolished a
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
couple of positions so this is an
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to hb1 if you looked at hb1 it
 
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
is just numbers there are not words
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
besides the footnotes at the end so this
 
00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
talking representative mums if I can see
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
you over there um this is the codes that
 
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
we talked about so here's the exact
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
position identified in das's budget
 
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.079 align:start position:0%
system of what needs to happen so this
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
abolish abolishes three positions within
 
00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:33.079 align:start position:0%
the Department of
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue so it doesn't look like a lot
 
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
but when entered into the budget system
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
it takes care of what is needed yeah and
 
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
you would have to know that section five
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
is the section that abolishes and
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
section four is the section that adds or
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
something like that right because the
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
the thing that adds positions looks very
 
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
similar yes and and the and the numbers
 
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
are they the um represent of M oh sorry
 
00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
sorry sliding
 
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
and the numbers are they the um the the
 
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.870 align:start position:0%
and the numbers are they the um the the
fiscal

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
year uh numbers the the three numbers
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
what do they
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
represent position those are the
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
position the position numbers yeah so
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
position numbers every employes job has
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
a five-digit number and I don't know
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
that they're in some kind of a system
 
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
right I think they're just
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
numbers yeah I'm not sure how Das
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
assigns it but we all do have a specific
 
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
employee code attached to us right yeah
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
Melissa's job as a number Jack's job as
 
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
Etc so that means we're limited to
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
100,000 employees right
 
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
so all right thank
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
Jack well you know you're the one that
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
hasn't been through this before
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
but take yeah yeah we're good we're here
 
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
and happy happy to help with whatever
 
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
you need we'll learn along the way we do
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
not know all the answers but we are good
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
at getting answers so if there anything
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
pops up and you're you have a question
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
for an agency um you're always welcome
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
to go to the agency yourself but if
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
you'd like us to just if you want to
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
throw it at us we'll go through and we
 
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
can do that for you um we'll let you
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
know if it's going to take a while or if
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's a heavy lift and if we can fit it
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
in as well because obviously there's two
 
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
of us who are trying to fit this all in
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
but for the most part I think the
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
members would feel we accommodate most
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
of your needs that are requested yeah
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
all right so Janet and and Melissa and
 
00:42:38.109 --> 00:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
Jack and I have started to schedule our
 
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
meetings with
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
agencies um and they're just sort of
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
overview stuff for for now right they're
 
00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to tell
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
us this is what we put in hb2 or this is
 
00:42:51.309 --> 00:42:51.319 align:start position:0%
what we put in hp1 they'll just be able
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
to tell us about their agencies and in
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
general what's going on with their
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
budget and so those are going to start
 
00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday and we'll be here pretty
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
much full days on the following four
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays I think um and and then we'll
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
get to February 15th and then we'll be
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
here most of the days um or you know as
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
many as as needed so um plan on just
 
00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
being here all Wednesdays if possible
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
for the next
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
months okay would uh representative Wier
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
or Lehman like to add anything cuz I
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
don't I don't have anything specific to
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
to we're just going to keep an eye
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
on yeah if he pulls out a white board
 
00:43:40.109 --> 00:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
look you know I found out I I I found
 
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
out that was totally against house rules
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
right so I shouldn't have done that yeah
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
yeah all that that stuff because we're
 
00:43:50.589 --> 00:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
not allowed to have the reason we have
 
00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
so much paper is we're not allowed to
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
have charts and and displays and you
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
know all that other stuff right so
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
um even though I think it would make
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
sense but it's it is a house rule
 
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
against all that kind of stuff
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
so an admission against interest
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
yes so yeah that was a good question um
 
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
and so what I said was we'll we'll try
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
to avoid taking votes during that um
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
that week and but I don't know I hearing
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
from representative wer I'm
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
not okay no but the question was about
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
about vacation week break week yeah
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
right cuz my other committee won't be
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:55.829 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
else want to say something no okay we'll
