currently on the regular agenda only
because

00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
the veterinary previous
 
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
rule for fees for the veterinary board
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
had expired
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
however at the july meeting the oplc had
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
put forward rules for fees as
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
and encompassed in those rules
 
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:17.990 align:start position:0%
and encompassed in those rules
were

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.750 align:start position:0%
were
the

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
since the july meeting those rules have
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
been adopted they were adopted on august
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
1st 2022 so there are now rules in
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
effect for the veterinary board to
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
collect fees
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%

collecting fees
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
during that time in which they were
 
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.829 align:start position:0%
during that time in which they were
expired

00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
expired
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
but attorney recorded already noted at
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
that time we
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
oplc had not been collecting fees once
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
the vet rules had expired up until we
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
started collecting fees again when the
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
oplc 1002s came into
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
an effect
 
00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.470 align:start position:0%
an effect
okay

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
do we need to take any action
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
had that on the regular agenda
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
because of the fee issue but also the
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
rules themselves are expired so in case
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
the committee also had any general
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
questions about the rules being expired
 
00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.829 align:start position:0%
questions about the rules being expired
and

00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
what action the board has been taking
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
with regard to licenses and
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
so the board has been approving
 
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.430 align:start position:0%
so the board has been approving
applications

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440 align:start position:0%

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
during the time but has not been
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
collecting fees as the board did not
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
have authority to collect the fees but
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
still had the authority in which to
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
approve and review applications
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%

updating all of their rules at this time
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
and you'll have that done
 
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.949 align:start position:0%
and you'll have that done
i

00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
think so i apologize i'm not the one
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
that works on the vet rules i'm covering
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
someone today but um we should have that
 
00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:53.430 align:start position:0%
someone today but um we should have that
done

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
by the end of the year i know a number
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
of them
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
are going through each board meeting
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
they're working on rules so
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
i know we have the 500s if this is the
 
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.110 align:start position:0%
i know we have the 500s if this is the
300s

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
300s
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
there are i wouldn't expect it to be
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
very long before the
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
the entire um rules are updated
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay veterinary medicine has a long
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
checkered history
 
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
with shell car
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
so somebody should try a little bit
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
harder yes and i know oplc has been
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
working regularly with the board
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
especially since i've come on in may
 
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.430 align:start position:0%
especially since i've come on in may
okay

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:37.910 align:start position:0%
any questions
here

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
so is the executive director in today uh
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
because i would like to speak with her
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
some other issues but i'm i would if she
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
is in i will discuss with her the
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
question that the chair has raised with
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
regard to where we are on this because
 
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.590 align:start position:0%
regard to where we are on this because
um

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
she is she had a
 
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:57.990 align:start position:0%
she is she had a
family

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.110 align:start position:0%
family
um

00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
conflict this morning so she will be in
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
later today that's why i'm here
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:11.429 align:start position:0%
 
sir

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
so mr chair this particular rule did
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
have a conditional approval request and
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
an amended conditional approval requests
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
so the committee will just need to vote
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
on whether to accept those
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
prior to voting on the rule and you're
 
00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:24.870 align:start position:0%
prior to voting on the rule and you're
good

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
i am good yes thank you okay need a
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%

discussion

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear mr chair the vote
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
was on the conditional
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
approval request and the amended thank
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.390 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so with regard to
item

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
9a on the agenda 2022 41
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
the agency had submitted a conditional
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
approval request
 
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.270 align:start position:0%
approval request
the

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request addressed
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
the majority of staff comments the only
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
two remaining issues were
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
first is a legislative intent comment on
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
page one
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
that comment is
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
that these rules have been expired
 
00:18:53.039 --> 00:18:54.549 align:start position:0%
that these rules have been expired
for

00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
a little while now since january 1st of
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
2022 so the committee may have questions
 
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.029 align:start position:0%
2022 so the committee may have questions
about

00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh how the agency has been enforcing
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
this particular rule
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
since it's been expired
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
the second comment is also on page one
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's an edit unclear comment
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
the initial
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
proposal had cited to rsa 161 j4 which
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
laid out the requirements for a standard
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
disclosure summary the comment asked
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
that they also include rsa 161 j5 which
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
has a requirement that the standard
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
disclosure summary be provided to the
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
potential resident 24 hours in advance
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
prior to the resident moving into
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
the particular
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
organization's rooming
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
the comment was misunderstood by the
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
agency and the agency deleted rsa 161 j4
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
to replace it with rsa 161 j5
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
which does address the issue of the
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
notice however the comment states that
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
they can put back in rsa
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
161 j4 to layout the requirements of
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
what's needed on the standard disclosure
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
and your new faces so tell us who you
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%

administrative rules coordinator at
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%

and your comment your response
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to the um edit unclear on
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
the first page there for uh 605.04a
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh yes correct reading the the note from
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
ols was misinterpreted as it only
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
referenced 161 j5 we are going to
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
include both
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
reference to j4 and j5 we did include
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
the language that was recommended by ols
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
so we will make that that edit and
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
and regarding whether we've been
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
enforcing the rule while it's expired we
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
have not
 
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.029 align:start position:0%
have not
okay

00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
nothing further
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
from me
 
00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.470 align:start position:0%
from me
yeah

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
yes carol
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that for three years you
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
haven't been enforcing a rule because
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
why do you need it in that case i mean
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
or why
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
or how are you managing to run your
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
i think you're looking at the other one
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
yeah oh okay this is only this year's
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a good question
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
i will reserve my comments for the next
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.909 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
um at this time i have no further
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
comments of
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh committee would like to take up the
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes mr chair so this rule there was
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
only one comment on page one once again
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
as a legislative intent comment as this
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
rule is also expired and this rule has
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
been expired since november 18th of 2019
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
so the committee may have questions
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
about how the agency has been enforcing
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
this particular rule or if they have
 
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.510 align:start position:0%
this particular rule or if they have
now

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
tell us about this
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
uh for the record again nicole

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.310 align:start position:0%
i will let brian clark speak to the
expiration

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
expiration
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
hi uh brian clark bureau of el dorado
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
adult services uh so what happened here
 
00:23:05.679 --> 00:23:06.390 align:start position:0%
adult services uh so what happened here
is

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
in 2019 when the rule was scheduled to
 
00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:10.149 align:start position:0%
in 2019 when the rule was scheduled to
expire

00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
expire
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
the department was planning legislation
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
to change how the
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
adrd respite care program worked in 2020
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
um the rule expired in the interim
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
and then in 2020 the legislation was set
 
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
to we would were planning to re-adopt
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
the rule in 2020 under the new
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
legislation that would change the
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
program however um kovid 19 shifted
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
priorities both within the department
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
and presumably within the legislator and
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
that brings us to today
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
was recently passed
 
00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
and now we are re-adopting to enact it
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
um in the interim
 
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.710 align:start position:0%
um in the interim
uh

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
we have had a budget allocated to this
 
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.669 align:start position:0%
we have had a budget allocated to this
program

00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
we have been spending it we have been
 
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.510 align:start position:0%
we have been spending it we have been
contracting

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
contracting
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
with contract agencies
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
to run this program and there is a
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
statute uh rsa 161 f 65 through 70
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's very nice
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
how many other of your rules
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%

for the whole department i'd like to
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
know because i'm extremely concerned
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
that you can go for three years without
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
a statute a rule to run a statutorily
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
managed program

administrator of the administrative
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
rules unit here for the department of
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
um the department is
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
becoming more staffed
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
and we are individually working with
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
specific programs to get their rules up
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
and running uh whichever is expired i
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
don't have a complete total for you um
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
but that is a priority of ours
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
um we're a large agency as you know we
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
have over 3000 rules
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
and we're trying really hard to get them
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
yeah pardon me i think it's ridiculous
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
that an organization like that can
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
not know how many of its rules are
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
expired or expiring and how on earth can
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
you manage to run run to your operation
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
without effective rules i don't know how
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
you can do it
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
senator whitley thank you mr chair
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question just sort
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
of on that line um
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
you know i know that
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
uh in past
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
budget years you know there have been
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
cuts to the department so i'm wondering
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
if you're aware of you know sort of the
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate and um i know there were
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
freezes on hiring and so can you speak
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
to how those vacancies inability to hire
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
cuts to your staff have impacted your
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
ability to look at those expired rules
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
um so since i've been here um almost
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
five years now there's only been
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
one uh sometimes two of us in the unit
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
um as the speaking for the whole
 
00:26:57.669 --> 00:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
department i am not sure that is above
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.149 align:start position:0%
 
bella

00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um and i'm it's more
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
of a comment but if you do need more
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
staff then i would hope that you would
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
come you know to the legislature in the
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
upcoming budget cycle to make sure that
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
you have the appropriate staff to
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
care thanks for trying thank you
 
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.990 align:start position:0%
care thanks for trying thank you
peter

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
peter
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so allison uh
 
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:27.909 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so allison uh
we

00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
we're all cognizant of the fact that the
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
covet has played havoc with a lot of
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
things in this country and on the planet
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
for that matter
 
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire has has just
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
spoken to
 
00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:42.549 align:start position:0%
spoken to
is

00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
the the concern that we all have
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
you don't know
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
what you don't know effectively and and
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh so is that that is something that i
 
00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:55.110 align:start position:0%
uh so is that that is something that i
think

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
to the degree that you possibly can get
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
a handle on
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
um know what's out there it's kind of
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
like we never look in that room we don't
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
know what's in that room and so forth
 
00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:06.389 align:start position:0%
know what's in that room and so forth
well

00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's not obviously
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
we understand the pandemic has been a
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
major factor in all this but the bottom
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
line is
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
we simply have to get a better handle on
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
what's out there
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
including all these
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
all these expired rules that are
 
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.350 align:start position:0%
all these expired rules that are
potentially

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.830 align:start position:0%
potentially
uh

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
playing havoc with uh orderly
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
functioning can have that may i respond
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
do you agree
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
um yes we do agree and actually we have
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
been working on creating a an internal
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
database of going through every single
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
rule um it's something that we are
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
working on and we have created with that
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
being said
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
due to the workload that's something
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's being balanced along with for
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
example opening i've had 55 rules myself
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
since january so it's just balancing
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
between prioritizing those rules but we
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
are building um
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
a by rule section by section of the
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
status of everything when this was
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
brought up to us
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
many months ago um it's something that
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a similar effort
 
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.870 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a similar effort
happening

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
administrative roles
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
for all everybody else
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
so perhaps they should be working
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
together to approve this
 
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.029 align:start position:0%
together to approve this
yes

00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay we need a motion to
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
ocean bigger by grey second by word
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.310 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
any

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.470 align:start position:0%
any
objections

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
in spite of the lengthy list of
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
postponements we will carry those over
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
to the next regular mr chair meeting
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
i apologize for interrupting i didn't
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
want to have dhhs leave because i have a
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
question for them under other business
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
yes uh yes so what was your question i'm
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
sorry there's we don't have an attorney
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
where do we get the other business but i
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
didn't want to pertain to administrative
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
rules yes okay go ahead thank you so mr
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
chair this is that question i sent about
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and the fact that
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
um under house bill 1035 we changed the
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
criteria for vaccination exemption at
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
schools to remove the notary requirement
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
and yet under the new form that dhhs put
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
forward they now ask a bunch of medical
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
questions in in alignment with asking
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
parents to acknowledge risk to things
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
that none of which was in the law that
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
was passed and so i'm concerned about a
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
how form was changed without coming
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
before jalcar and b how the new
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
conditions apply in three it appears
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's two different forms on the dhhs
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
website one for child care one for child
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
care and schools so i'm concerned that a
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
it didn't come through rules processed
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
for the form change and for the
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
information and we haven't seen any
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
rules around that form
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
and i just want to have the agency bring
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
that forward
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i personally cannot speak
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
to that at this time i'm gonna take i'm
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
taking down some notes to bring back to
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
uh the department and i'm not certain if
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
allison she's the administrator of the
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
unit she and i together the unit um this
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
could be something that she'd been
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
working on and i'm just not involved in
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
that but um you said the house bill was
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
did you say 10 35 house bill 10 35 and
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
35 they just removed the notary
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
requirement which so we expected it just
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
being my kids unvaccinated due to the
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
fact that they have a religious
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
exemption period but the new form
 
00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.830 align:start position:0%
exemption period but the new form
says

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
he's exempt from certain you know he has
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
you check off which vaccines they are it
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
makes parents acknowledge risk i think
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
there's is there is that some statute
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
right is that yes it's there's part of
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
it under statute
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
not the things you're asking for okay so
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
it goes above and beyond the statute
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely okay
 
00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:10.630 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely okay
um

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
and you said you saw it for both public
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
school systems and private child care
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
right so there's a form i'm on your
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
website and there's one form that's
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
that's dated
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
it was last time i was revised it says
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
was 5 18 and that's four
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
certification religious exemption and
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
child care programs and immunization and
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
then there's another form you have
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's titled the hampshire child care
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
school immunization religious exemption
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
so you have two different four and that
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
one's dated july of 22.
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
and so both forms are on your website
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
one still requires a notary requirement
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
um and the other one asks for
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
information that's way beyond the scope
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
of the change of the law okay
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
i um beyond school
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
i will bring this back to allison as
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
when i get back to the office
 
00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.990 align:start position:0%
when i get back to the office
and

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
i will make her aware and have her you
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
know look and do it what have you and
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
speak to the attorney who who does work
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
with immunizations
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
and do
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
i'm new to this do you want alison to
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry representative mcguire yes
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
oh i'm concerned also that
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
the department has
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
no authority to adopt this sort of form
 
00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.149 align:start position:0%
no authority to adopt this sort of form
without

00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
going through this process
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
and if it's in the if it's dated in july
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
that means we should have seen it last
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
month and we didn't yes i 100 agree with
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
you um
 
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
i will see what happened i don't know if
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh if a department or an individual for
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
some reason created a form and posted it
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
without our knowledge but it's been
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
brought to our attention
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
we don't have full control over the
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
website and who posts things so a unit
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
could technically do that which isn't
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
okay if you could make sure that anyone
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
who posts anything has had it properly
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
approved that
 
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.590 align:start position:0%
approved that
or

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
may make the owner of the website know
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
that because it is very distressing that
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
random people
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
can create a form that ha that is a rule
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
that has the effect of law
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
and just plop it on your website without
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
anyone reviewing it yeah
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
i agree and if i understand it that's
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
what happened yeah it says each unit
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
does have an individual who can upload
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
to the website and that you're correct
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
of course isn't the proper channel um
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
it's a bigger issue clearly and i'll
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
i'll bring it up to those above me to
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
probably have to speak across the
 
00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:39.669 align:start position:0%
probably have to speak across the
departments

00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know given that
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
schools will open soon
 
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.030 align:start position:0%
schools will open soon
and

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
this form which apparently has not been
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
properly approved
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
will be in effect
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
take a recess so that someone could
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
check right now but it doesn't seem to
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
me that this form should be
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
left there
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
and in force for the beginning of school
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
which is very very soon i noticed the
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
other day when i was out campaigning
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
that one of the towns is opening august
 
00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:18.390 align:start position:0%
that one of the towns is opening august
29th

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
29th
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
so that must be it's a little later
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
usually in the north country because of
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
the lancaster fair but many schools are
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
opening this month
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
and so this is a really important thing
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
i think to take a recess and see whether
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
we can deal now
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
with getting that okay we're not going
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
to try to revamp
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
their posting system
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's not the posting system it's the
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
parents are going to have to fill this
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
out apparently
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
is that not who is directed towards uh
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative lang i'm just tagging on
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
i haven't talked with representative
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
lang in advance so perhaps he could get
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
a little more information about why he's
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
concerned so again i the the form is
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
posted up online and the parents looking
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
for an exemption form that's the form
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
they're gonna find um on dhh's website
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
so and it's a form that's not been
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
vetted properly and should be taken off
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
the website
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
i also want to bring to the committee's
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
attention that it appears that we do
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
have an interim rule uh with our office
 
00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.150 align:start position:0%
have an interim rule uh with our office
2022-5

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
2022-5
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
that should be on the september agenda
 
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:23.990 align:start position:0%
that should be on the september agenda
that

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
this discussion may
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
be able to address at that time
 
00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
okay so we're looking for assurance from
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
the department today
 
00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.430 align:start position:0%
the department today
that

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
the guilty form has been removed
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
the jail car staff
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
and just for clarification uh attorney
 
00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.670 align:start position:0%
and just for clarification uh attorney
ricard

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
ricard
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
the interim rule that's in place doesn't
 
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.870 align:start position:0%
the interim rule that's in place doesn't
cover

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
cover
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
representative lang's concerns correct
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
like it does it's not part of that rule
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
all i know is that
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
we currently have a interim rule i've
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
just been notified by
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
one of the other staff members that
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
there's a rule that this
 
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
discussion will happen at on the
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
september agenda i have not personally
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
looked at the rule so i don't know
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
what's in there um can you give me that
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
rule number or the notice number or
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
either yes it's interim rule 2022 five
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
okay it's atp something 300 something
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
i just have that's okay i just have our
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
internal number that's right um and i
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
also just wanted to
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
reiterate um the committee's concerns
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
that if a form is not approved by jail
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
carol yes i'd like to
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
um mention that this
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
sounds like an
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
ideal application of the
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
emergency update to forms
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
because the law passed you want to have
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
it before the beginning of school and it
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
should have been able to be
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
very quickly implemented
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
would would hope that the department is
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
aware of that option
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes i will can speak to them about
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
the expedited revision to form process
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
should that have been
 
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.270 align:start position:0%
should that have been
um

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
if this is something that we can even do
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
though it sounds like there's concern
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
that it's above and beyond the scope
 
00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.470 align:start position:0%
that it's above and beyond the scope
regardless

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
um but yes i will bring this straight to
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
allison when i get back and speak to the
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
proper inner channels and then
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
allison will reach out to ols attorneys
 
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.589 align:start position:0%
allison will reach out to ols attorneys
today

00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:24.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay so with that
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
we're adjourned
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
you
