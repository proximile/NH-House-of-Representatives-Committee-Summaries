components of things that are uh in our
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
capital budget as well as some other uh
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
important items that didn't quite make
 
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh the governor's budget uh for both
 
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
facilities and information technology
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
and then talk about um them in summary
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
at the end um for what we're looking at
 
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
for total dollars uh basically a high
 
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
level overview is we have about three
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
new capital uh projects that are
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
associated with our buildings uh and
 
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:11.240 align:start position:0%
repairs and maintenance we do have a lot
 
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
of projects um that need attention we
 
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
prioritized three for this bium um there
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
are six others that we would like to ask
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
for consideration for as well for
 
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
facilities whereas with our Information
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
Services capital projects we have about
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
eight major projects for UT he about
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
today um critical projects that are uh
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
essential to continue some of our
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
services that we provide to our most
 
00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations um and they
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
they're pieced and flow together and
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
Dave weers will explain all of those
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
pieces we also in addition to the eight
 
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
we have about four other projects that
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
we uh would like to bring to your
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
attention as important requests um on
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
the right side is a pie chart in terms
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
of what we're looking at for our federal
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
cost for our capital budget you'll see
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's about 81% of our total cost whereas
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
the general funds is about
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
18% um so we do get uh quite a bit of a
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
projects so our first uh Pro uh area to
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
cover is uh Glen Cliff home uh and some
 
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
other pieces and I'm going to invite
 
00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
Dave clap to join us speaking to walk us
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%

the Glen Cliffe facility the roof on it
 
00:12:49.189 --> 00:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
has deteriorated significantly um and
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
it's actually shown its wear um
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
drastically in the past year and a half
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
so in order to maintain the Integrity of
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
the building
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
we're looking to have that roof replaced
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
um it's a fairly large roof uh it's $
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
1.1 million as um put into the
 
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:15.069 align:start position:0%
1.1 million as um put into the

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
budget see are there any questions uh
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
slide okay seeing that I'll go to the
 
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%

there I had asked um I'm going back a
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
couple years ago I just want to make
 
00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
sure that whoever does the roof work is
 
00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.829 align:start position:0%
sure that whoever does the roof work is
familiar

00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
familiar
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
and has seen the site that they're going
 
00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:04.519 align:start position:0%
to be working on so that there's no um
 
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
surprises when it comes to paying the
 
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
bills from
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
estimates uh Yes
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
actually starting these past couple of
 
00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:17.959 align:start position:0%
projects that we have done we make it a
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
mandatory that the any biders have to
 
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
visit the site and review the work to be
 
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
done thank you you're
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
question who is
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
speaking representative
 
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
Abbot uh if you could raise your hand it
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
would help but go ahead
 
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
okay um is this the same Wing where I
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
believe it was two bium ago that they
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
had to replace all the
 
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
windows yes it
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:10.470 align:start position:0%
 
moving

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
on um the next is New Hampshire hospital
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
seclusion room safety upgrades there's
 
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
been a large change in a lot of the
 
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:24.759 align:start position:0%
requirements for uh the hospital and
 
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
this is uh seclusion rooms to ensure
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
that the client is not injure themselves
 
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
and it is um a fairly substantial
 
00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
upgrade for them I believe it's five
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
different uh rooms that we're looking at
 
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759 align:start position:0%
and um it is to put the Protections in
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
place to keep the um clients from
 
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:55.710 align:start position:0%
place to keep the um clients from
injuring

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital Renovations uh
 
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
comply with health and safety standards
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
C and D unit we're in the process of
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
doing enf now uh these are units that
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
had held um youth previously and they're
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
being brought up to current standards
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
for use by
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
adults um it's uh I believe will
 
00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:33.309 align:start position:0%
adults um it's uh I believe will
include

00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
um enlarging the no not enlarging but
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
making it uh capable of handling uh more
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
does this is um Joe Kirsty from New
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital I just wanted to to
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
jump in here um and uh the these
 
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
Renovations won't necessarily increase
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
census for the hospital um but they the
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
current units are really original to
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
when the building was built which is
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
about 32 years ago um and so this
 
00:17:06.909 --> 00:17:06.919 align:start position:0%
project would really help us bring the
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
facilities in line with um a lot of our
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
regulatory expectations um Joint
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
Commission is our primary regulator uh
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
and uh there's quite a few facility
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
things that that uh they oversee and and
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
um these these Renovations as Dave
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned we're doing one on enf unit
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
right now um we're hoping to get CN D
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
unit done in this upcoming by anym uh
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
really improve the hospital's ability to
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
Joe if we're good with questions I can
 
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
move to the next slide representative
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
Graham go
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
ahead uh Joe while you're while you're
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
on here do you want to uh talk a little
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
bit about the the just this slide here
 
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
sure sure um I just wanted to mention to
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
the committee so uh this specific
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
project is actually in the department of
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
administrative Services Capital uh
 
00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
budget um so uh the Department of Health
 
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
and Human Services took over occupancy
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
of the Philbrook building over the
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
summer uh we're currently running a
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
transitional housing program out of that
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
building uh but it does have persistent
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
sewer issues so this was just a kind of
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
a plug for uh from Health and Human
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
Services for this project that is in uh
 
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh Department of administrative Services
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
capital budget uh I believe it's a
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
$300,000 project um but there is a a
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
sincere need to fix some of the uh sewer
 
00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:41.799 align:start position:0%
line issues in that building um
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
especially now that we have patients
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
facility any questions on uh
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative fi you have a question
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
unmute your question I'm just wondering
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
if this these projects you're mentioning
 
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.909 align:start position:0%
if this these projects you're mentioning
so

00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
far are they not in the Governor's
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
budget are these things outside the
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
budget the these are in the governor's
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
budget so far okay now when when you
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
come to those things would you delineate
 
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
which is which when something's not in
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget so we have a clear
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
understanding sure yes thank you so this
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
on that note this slide would conclude
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
what was um this is in the governor's
 
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
budget for Department of admin Services
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
the slides prior to
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
which was the CN unit of New Hampshire
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
hospital as well as the wing uh Lamont
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
Wing the roof those are included in the
 
00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:09.559 align:start position:0%
governor's budget but what we're about
 
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
to show you past the slide for
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
facilities is not included in the
 
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.430 align:start position:0%
facilities is not included in the
governor's

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
budget um commissioner why don't we hit
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
what is in the budget before we go on to
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
your wish
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
list absolutely so we did four
 
00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
facilities need um I have two sections
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
to this presentation the first half of
 
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
it is all of our facilities and repair
 
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
and maintenance which we just went over
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
so this those those items that I just
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
shared with you now for facilities are
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
the only facilities items covered right
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
now in the governor's budget including
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
the Das item
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
here so that would at this point
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
anything beyond that would be um
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
critical needs that are not
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
included and I will give you an
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about them later but
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
first I'd like to go through what the
 
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
governor has
 
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
proposed okay so I will then move on to
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
our Information Services um section of
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
what's included in the governor's budget
 
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
and at this point um to do that and
 
00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:17.559 align:start position:0%
we'll come back we can come back to
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
what's not included for facilities Dave
 
00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:22.039 align:start position:0%
weers I'm going to stop sharing so that
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:29.799 align:start position:0%
slide uh so Dave weers is the director
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
of our information services and he's
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
going to pick up and cover for you what
 
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
was included in the governor's budget uh
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
for Information Services System starting
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
system you were good Dave I don't know
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
where it went you go apologize for that
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair members of the

slides are in the Governor's capital
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
budget um submitt and starting with the
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
dcyf where division of children youth
 
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
and families comprehensive child welfare
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
information system one of one of the
 
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
things I just want to pre preface all of
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
these projects as Deputy Commissioner
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
Lori Weaver indicated are associated
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
with what we would call life cycle
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
management and it
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
modernization what life cycle management
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
is is over time systems um get old and
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
they stop functioning as as effectively
 
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
as they can just like your car or house
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
you need to maintain them in order to
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
provide better services to our citizens
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
and um in clients throughout New
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and all of these systems are
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
Legacy systems that are way past their
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
normal lifespan and we are in either
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy of federal funding um
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
certifications or other audit findings
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
that has resulted in these Capital
 
00:22:59.470 --> 00:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
project submittals so so again starting
 
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
with our comprehensive child welfare
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
information system this system is
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
associated with the federal mandate from
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
the administration for children youth
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
and families Administration for Children
 
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
and Families I apologize and the current
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
system that we have which is commonly
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
known as Bridges is 23 years old it is
 
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
an it is on an architecture that is was
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
developed back 23 years ago and it's
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
actually not a common um development
 
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
platform today so it makes it difficult
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
for us to identify resources to maintain
 
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
the system as well as change the system
 
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
to meet Federal man federal and state
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
mandates associated with this Capital
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
project we have been working in the past
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
two years on the initial intake and
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
assessment components of this system
 
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
which allows us to bring people in
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
assess their needs and then move it back
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
into the Legacy system to do case
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
management reporting and then claims
 
00:23:57.919 --> 00:23:59.190 align:start position:0%
management reporting and then claims
processing

00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
processing
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
this Capital project will allow us to
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
move into years three and four of a
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
six-year plan to replace the case
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
management component and the reporting
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
functionality the final um years of the
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
six-year plan five and six would be
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
replacing the the the claims processing
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
solution which you'll find that we're
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
trying to marry together or braid
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
together with our Medicaid management
 
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
information system strategic plan and
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
looking at uh claims solution for the
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
Department as a
 
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
whole the estimated savings projected
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
for this implementation is um estimated
 
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
at $4 million and that's associated with
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
the administration for Children and
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
Families um surveys and estimates
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
regarding their their um new model for
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive child welfare information
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
associated with practice improved
 
00:24:54.389 --> 00:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
practice functionality and
 
00:24:57.389 --> 00:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
processing currently we have our case
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
managers having to maintain the system
 
00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
in multiple different places as well as
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
manual processes in order to manage
 
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
their their case load which is taking um
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
very um taking time away from their very
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
important um core competency of
 
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
providing services to their
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
clients I'll stop there to ask if anyone
 
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you so the next several
 
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
capital projects are associated with our
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid management information system
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to put a slide up here to
 
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
just give you a background as what is
 
00:25:46.389 --> 00:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
that Medicaid management information
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
system and what is the history of that
 
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
system so you understand the complexity
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
and the the different components that we
 
00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
need to implement um associate with the
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
capital project to meet the new
 
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
strategic directions as well as maintain
 
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
the life cycle of that that program so
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
that system uh was designed in 2005 and
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
we contracted through
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
RFP award in 2007 in 2007 we purchased
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
the hardware and software and that was
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
the LA that was up until this past year
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
that was the last time we actually
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
replaced any hardware and software on
 
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
the system we went live with the system
 
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
in 2013 and certified in 2015
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
now certification is an important
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
component for the State of New Hampshire
 
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
as well as other states in that when we
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
certify the the Medicaid management
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
information system our federal Partners
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
increase their Federal match from a 50%
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
to a 75% of the maintenance and
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
operations of the system it takes
 
00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 18 to 24 months to certify
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
these systems and it's a pretty large
 
00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:53.240 align:start position:0%
dedicated effort to meet all of the
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
standards that our federal Partners
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
require of our
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
system the key benefits of the system
 
00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
that for our organization is is and for
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire is that
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
one in seven of our of our um New
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents are taking advantage
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
of or not taking advantage or leveraging
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
the mmis or Medicaid Program and this
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program integrates with all of
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
our common systems so across the board
 
00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:23.559 align:start position:0%
it integrates with our division for CH
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
children youin family system our elderly
 
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
adult care system our child support
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
system our eligibility system as well as
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
our data warehousing um
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
environment it is a key component for
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
our federal claiming and funding
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
match it it actually has 30,000 PR
 
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
providers enrolled in the system and on
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
a annual basis it is processing $1.8
 
00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:49.519 align:start position:0%
billion of
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
claims we as a result of many different
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
um requirements from our federal
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
Partners we continuously enhance this
 
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:00.039 align:start position:0%
this environment and the primary
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
penalties that we're we're seeing this
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
this current bium and we'll see next
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
bium um until we Implement is our
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
electronic visit verification system so
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
in Prior in Prior bams we did submit the
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
electronic Vis visic verification
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
Capital project which you'll see in a
 
00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:22.519 align:start position:0%
moment and it was not approved which has
 
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
resulted in this this fiscal year we're
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
identifying n just under $900,000 in
 
00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:28.909 align:start position:0%
identifying n just under $900,000 in
penalties

00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
and it was estimated to cost us 566,000
 
00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
of general fund to
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
implement other penalties and risks is
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
we implement we are implementing the
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
interoperability and patient access
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
final rule this year in the mismis which
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
is associated with providing member
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
access to the claims information and the
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
interoperability with other systems our
 
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
component of that is for our fee for
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
service um claims processing which is
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
about 6% of the overall claims the
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
remaining 94% are Managed Care um
 
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.990 align:start position:0%
remaining 94% are Managed Care um
oranization

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
oranization
 
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility and then the final risk
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
we have of not doing these capital
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
projects is associated with the
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
certification um Center for Medicade and
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
Medicare Services has indicated that we
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
do need to have a solid approved
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
reprocurement strategy and and life
 
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
cycle management strategy for our
 
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid management information system
 
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
and if we are unable to update that plan
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
with our five-year strategy this year
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
they theyve indicated that they may need
 
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
to pull our certification from our
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
system which would result in an
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
estimated $6.6 million in increased
 
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
impacts so going from this slide we have
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
several projects that are in the
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
governor's um um Governor's recommended
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
budget um for Capital and the first one
 
00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
starts with our mmis life cycle and
 
00:30:00.679 --> 00:30:01.990 align:start position:0%
starts with our mmis life cycle and
reprocurement

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
reprocurement
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
strategy so essentially what we have
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
identified is two things we need to
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
maintain and operate the existing system
 
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
and that existing system given that has
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
not been maintained and has deferred
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance over the last 13 years um
 
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
now 14 years we have to invest in our
 
00:30:24.669 --> 00:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
servers and our storage and the other
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
technology infrastructure as well as
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
come up with a 5-year reprocurement
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
strategy to replace that architecture
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
with current um current functionality to
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
improve our our services and reduce our
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
costs as part of that five-year
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
reprocurement strategy in this Capital
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
project we we have identified it
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
identified um the $90 million or 9
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
million general fund to start with a
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
Provider Services call center care
 
00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:58.519 align:start position:0%
coordination and system integration
 
00:31:01.389 --> 00:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
components of of the mm the Medicaid
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
management system and then begin to
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
continue onto other modules like our
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
claims processing which is the core of
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
the system I'll stop there for a moment
 
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
to see if there's any questions on the
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
I do have one it's representative Graham
 
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
um you talked about this being a
 
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
multi-year what's the risk if future
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
continuation thank you Mr chair and
 
00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:40.519 align:start position:0%
members of the committee the risk of not
 
00:31:42.629 --> 00:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
continuing this Capital program would
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
require us to maintain and operate the
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
Legacy system in in conjunction with the
 
00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
the new modules as we Implement these
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
new modules they will interoperate with
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
the existing Legacy system so that we
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
would be able to continue processing
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
medic claims however we would not be
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
able to realize all the benefits of a
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
new system until we've completed all of
 
00:32:05.399 --> 00:32:08.110 align:start position:0%
new system until we've completed all of
the

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.629 --> 00:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
modules thank
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
chairman I see no other
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
questions Mr
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
chairman representative
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
Thompson I I have asked people to use
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
the electronic raising hand and the I
 
00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
can't see everybody with the slide up so
 
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
if you could help me with that I would
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate it representative Thompson go
 
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
ahead I don't have a hand showing on my
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
screen for whatever reason sorry um on
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
the previous um slide you showed us it
 
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
showed the procurement of the
 
00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
showed the procurement of the
materials

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:53.240 align:start position:0%
um in 2007 and it went live in
 
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
2013 it took six years to implement this
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
new process
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
with the materials she bought in
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
2007 thank you representative Thompson
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair it did take six years to
 
00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
implement in in there was many different
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
reasons um some of them were Federal
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
mandate changes to the system as well as
 
00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
this the Medicaid management information
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
system is the most complex system that
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
we have um for the department and a
 
00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
common implementation across Most states
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
is anywhere from five to eight years to
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
implement an mismis back when it was
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
what they call a monolithic um approach
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
where you basically instead of doing
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
modular which you see at the bottom of
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
the slid Provider Services claims
 
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
processing system integrator instead of
 
00:33:42.669 --> 00:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
breaking them up into pieces um the
 
00:33:44.669 --> 00:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
previous direction from our federal
 
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
Partners was to do it all at once which
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
required all the integration of those
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
components and all the project
 
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
management of all those components to
 
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
work together and and would go live at
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
one point in time that was the primary
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
reason for the delay for six-year
 
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.230 align:start position:0%
reason for the delay for six-year
implementation

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
plan follow up Mr uh
 
00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up um so if we give you
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
the $4.6 million we asking for for the
 
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
current updates how long will it take to
 
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.270 align:start position:0%
current updates how long will it take to
implement

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
implement
 
00:34:22.589 --> 00:34:22.599 align:start position:0%
those and if
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
we if we do this are we running um
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
are we running old software by the time
 
00:34:33.069 --> 00:34:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
implemented you understand what I mean
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Thompson um
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
could you clarify the $4.6 Million
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
number for Me Maybe I'm looking at the
 
00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:45.030 align:start position:0%
number for Me Maybe I'm looking at the
wrong

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
one I'm looking at the government's
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
Governor's budget this the one we're
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
talking about is 9 million in general
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
funds it's 10% of the total cost
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right I'm
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
mistaken but I guess my question is by
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
the time we get the software and
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
implement it is it out of Co out of
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
date that is a very good question
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative Thompson and Mr chair
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
the pretty much any time in technology
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
the minute you implement it it is old um
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
however the the newer technology new
 
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
strategy of modular procurement along
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
with some more technical components of
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
how it works
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
is leveraging um I would say maybe
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner goule could help me with
 
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
this conversation but however it would
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
say it will be deprecated however it
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
will be on current current development
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
platforms and so that we can continue to
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
scale and sustain the system whereas
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
right now the the the current solution
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
that it's running on is seven versions
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
old of Oracle and IBM products which is
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
no no longer supported by our vendors we
 
00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
would be on the current version of all
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
of those supported project products as
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
well as the current Hardware so our
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
vendors would continue to support the
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
system which is a key component of
 
00:36:14.829 --> 00:36:14.839 align:start position:0%
certification with CMS as well as when
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
we update to the current what normally
 
00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
happens with most of our vendors is they
 
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
support what it's called a n minus1 or
 
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
nus 2 current version minus two versions
 
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
so they'll let us continue to support
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
that 45 to 10 year
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
period okay thank you very much
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
representative eel yes thank you and
 
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr weeders for being here um I
 
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
think you know we have a copy of the
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
governor's budget and then we have a
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
copy of um your requests and so I'm just
 
00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
trying to align what I see in the budget
 
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
to your requests I see the mmis life
 
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:53.910 align:start position:0%
to your requests I see the mmis life
cycle

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
management um is 35 million that was
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
your priority five I see a total maybe
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
you're getting to this and if you are I
 
00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
can just hold up but I see your total
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
request is 90 million so maybe some of
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
number that's a very good question
 
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079 align:start position:0%
representative eel and Mr chair um our
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
original request was for 35 million for
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
the life cycle management of the
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
solution and that 35 million will
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
essentially take all of that Oracle and
 
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
IBM as along along with several other
 
00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
software vendors and up update them to
 
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
current technology as well as upgrade
 
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
the hardware to the current technology
 
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
so that we would be able to maintain it
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
for the next five years while we are
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
also doing a reprocurement strategy so
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
subsequent to our request we we um met
 
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
with the governor and addressed our mmis
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
strategic plan for reprocurement over
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
the next five years and he added to his
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
go his recommended um cap toal budget
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
the additional 55 million so that we can
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
start on that reprocurement strategy so
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
that we're not here next by Anum asking
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
for another extension of of life cycle
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
Management on a legacy uh system so the
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
idea there is that at some point in time
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
you you in it you look at a system and
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
say is it old enough to be replac
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
replaced and you look at that and
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
balance it say how much does it cost to
 
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.030 align:start position:0%
balance it say how much does it cost to
maintain

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
and operate the current system and what
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
are the impacts toward the the customers
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
or in this case the clients and the
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
citizens as a result of that older
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
technology we've identified a 10-year
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
life cycle for most of these large
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
systems to get a return on the
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
investment is all as well as indicate
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
say we're going to leverage the
 
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
technology for 10 years and then replace
 
00:38:51.309 --> 00:38:51.319 align:start position:0%
it with the current technology so that
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
we could use it for another 10 years so
 
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
that not only do we improve the
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
processes internally for our staff we
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
also improve the services that we're
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
providing um both from a self-service
 
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.990 align:start position:0%
providing um both from a self-service
perspective

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
leveraging um newer Technologies like
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
text messaging to people having web um
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
apps that are on their phones as opposed
 
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
to having to go to a a web page on a
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
computer those are some of the new the
 
00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:20.839 align:start position:0%
nuances of newer technology that weren't
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
available back in
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
2007 so that's what that additional 55
 
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
million or 5.5 million in uh General
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
funds would fund and we were planning to
 
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
start that with our Provider Services um
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
component our call center component our
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
care coordination component and system
 
00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:45.079 align:start position:0%
integrator as well as you'll see other
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
capital projects in in the the next
 
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:49.640 align:start position:0%
several slides to address some other
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
components of the mmis to include our
 
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.550 align:start position:0%
components of the mmis to include our
federal

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:53.560 align:start position:0%

I would point out that right now the
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
committee is focused on what the
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
governor has proposed whether we keep
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
that and then in our work sessions and
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
executive sessions we will look at any
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
additional requests that may or may not
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
be able to be funded in the current bium
 
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
so I need the committee and uh the
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
department as they present to keep that
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
in mind so that we are not getting
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
confused with we want an extra 5 million
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
and assume that it is part of the
 
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.109 align:start position:0%
and assume that it is part of the
governor's

00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
budget thank you Mr chair to be to to
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
clarify the this mmis life cycle
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
management and reprocurement is in the
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
governor's budget the full 90 million
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
and it is item number eight on the the
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
so the next project associated with the
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
Medicaid management information system
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
is our federal reporting integrity and
 
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
compliance um Capital project again this
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
is part of the governor's recommended
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
budget and this is key to maintaining
 
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
our federal match associated with u
 
00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
updating our CMS 64 report which is our
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
report that is used for submittals for
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
federal financial participation and that
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
is the key report that we need to submit
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
quarterly on time in order to continue
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
our federal matching um
 
00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
funds additionally it's going to address
 
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
our current issues associated with
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
claims adjudication for encounter
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
claimes as well as our Pharmacy benefits
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
management reporting our tmis reporting
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
and then as we implement the electronic
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
Vis verification system it will need to
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
integrate into our federal reporting
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
strategy it would in it would integrate
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
here as
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
well this platform has been implemented
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
over the last several years and we
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
continue to grow and and expand it so
 
00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
this particular project is not a 90 90%
 
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
federally funded project as a result of
 
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
our goal to have one single Enterprise
 
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
business intelligence platform where we
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
bring our data together to be able to
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
effect effectively Not Duplicate efforts
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
across our different divisions this will
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
reduce our our costs overall as if we
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
did it the the original direction we
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
would have seven or eight of these
 
00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
different platforms and Implement these
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
seven or eight different times on
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
different systems that integration is
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
planned to bring in our Behavioral
 
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
Health System our New Hampshire hospital
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
data into the system which has already
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
begun as well as continue the
 
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
integration between our children youth
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
and Families Our eligibility system
 
00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
child support service as and long-term
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
supports and
 
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
services it it also will continue in to
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
enhance and extend the system to support
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
the master client index which enables us
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
to basically leverage the economies of
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
scale of one system and connect to it
 
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
from our other from our various Case
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
Management Systems within our Divi
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
different divisions within our
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
department and then the final component
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
is the final component here in enhance
 
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
and extend is our data governance or
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
metadata management and data management
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
which is in is important to adhere to
 
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:40.839 align:start position:0%
federal and state um privacy and
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
security rules to ensure that we are
 
00:43:46.589 --> 00:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
sharing the data with people that need
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
to have access to the data and that
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
we're able to log who has had access to
 
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
it and report on that information as
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
well as well as continue the data
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
Integrity which means keeping it
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
um keeping it consistent and accurate
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
out I'll stop there to see if there's
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
none and then we have our electronic
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
visit verification system and again as I
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
stated earlier in the in the testimony
 
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
this is associated with a federal
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
mandate it is the 21st century cures act
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
which was signed into law in December of
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
2016 originally it was required for all
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
states to have this implemented by
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2020 however many States
 
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
including our our own requested for um a
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
goodfaith e effort exemption to January
 
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.309 align:start position:0%
goodfaith e effort exemption to January
1st

00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
1st
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
2021 hoping that we would identify the
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
funds to be able to implement it prior
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
to that deadline unfortunately we were
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
unable to um identify those funds
 
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
through either Capital submissions or or
 
00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
um operating submissions and we were
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
unable to implement that system by
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2021 the center for Medicaid
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
and Medicare Services has indicated that
 
00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
they will be um imposing a penalty on
 
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
our personal care services initially for
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 2021 and in count and
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
future fiscal years in the amount of of
 
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
0.25% in 2021 which equates to about
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
$860,000 um for this this bium and then
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
will increase over time to include the
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
Home Health Service um penalties if we
 
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
continue to not Implement an electronic
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
visit verification system this system is
 
00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.829 align:start position:0%
visit verification system this system is
gold

00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
gold
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
at um reducing fraud and being able to
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
post payment recruitment but basically
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
identify U what's happening so what it
 
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
will do from a process as you see on the
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
right of the slide is the provider
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
arrives at a client home they
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
electronically check in to say that
 
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
they're actually at the at the Home in
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
the residence it will do a GPS
 
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
verification that they are there they
 
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
provide the services they record the
 
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
services and then the visits are
 
00:46:22.589 --> 00:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
basically confirmed prior to billing and
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
this will help reduce fraud and automate
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
that process um Most states not all
 
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
states but Most states have implemented
 
00:46:32.829 --> 00:46:32.839 align:start position:0%
this system we will be one of very few
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
that have not at this
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
point our funding request for this
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
amounts to a 566,000 general funds which
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
I just want to note that that general
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
fund impact is less than what our
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
penalties will be if this if this
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
Capital project is not
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
approved any questions on I do have a
 
00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
couple of questions when you were
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
talking about uh fiscal years you were
 
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
talking uh Federal fiscal years for
 
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
example we're almost halfway through the
 
00:47:08.109 --> 00:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
federal fiscal 21 so no matter what we
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
do we're got to pay that for this
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
year thank you Mr chair you are correct
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
we are paying an $894,000 or
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
$864,000 penalty estimated penalty this
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year and then next fiscal
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
year or 2022 we anticipate that penalty
 
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
to be 1.3 million and that would be our
 
00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year um penalties not the
 
00:47:38.109 --> 00:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
federal fiscal year penalties and if we
 
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
we being the general court and the
 
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
governor approve this in the capital
 
00:47:44.589 --> 00:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
budget will we be able to get an
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
exemption for the following fiscal year
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
because we've shown good faith effort
 
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
that we will be implementing this
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
program thank you Mr chair that that is
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
correct actually the way um the center
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid Medicare services will be
 
00:48:04.109 --> 00:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
effectuating the penalty is on a
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis so the if we are able to
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
implement the electronic Vis
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
verification system by April of 2022
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
which is our our goal date at this point
 
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
if we were approved starting in July 1
 
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
to move on the project then we would not
 
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
be penalized for future quarters and so
 
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
it would reduce our penalties in the
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
next bium
 
00:48:27.599 --> 00:48:32.430 align:start position:0%
next bium
thank

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:35.559 align:start position:0%
you and the the last project associated
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
with the Medicaid management information
 
00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
system specifically is our beneficiary
 
00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.390 align:start position:0%
system specifically is our beneficiary
service

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
improvement and and this again is part
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
of the governor's um budget
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation and this specific one
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
will address many different components
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
so there as we go to repr procure a
 
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
system we are required to have an
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
independent verification valid ation
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
contract which is essentially is a cont
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
a third party contract to review and
 
00:49:05.549 --> 00:49:05.559 align:start position:0%
report on the activities that we
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
Implement in the Medicaid management
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
information system and that report goes
 
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
to the Center for Medicaid Medicare
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
Services essentially is an audit of all
 
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
of our activities for enhancements to
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
the system and it's required for us to
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
have in order to continue a
 
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.270 align:start position:0%
have in order to continue a
reprocurement

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
reprocurement
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
effort additionally we would be
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
implementing um update third party
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
liability um claims for for fraud and
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
fraud detection system that we're
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
working with our our um our division to
 
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
address that from a quality assurance
 
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
and in in a program Integrity
 
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
perspective the the other components of
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
this would be to improve um self-service
 
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
functionality as well as maintain our
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
federal financial participation funding
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
to M to keep our system in compliance
 
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
there's so there's several different
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
components of of this Medicaid system
 
00:50:02.789 --> 00:50:02.799 align:start position:0%
that require updates and this is why we
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
actually pulled them into several
 
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
different capital projects to associate
 
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:09.559 align:start position:0%
them specifically to those components
 
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
and then you'll see that we have a few
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
other items listed at the top here and
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
then some other functionality that we've
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
been trying to implement um associated
 
00:50:21.789 --> 00:50:21.799 align:start position:0%
with the Medicaid system to to manage
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
Nursing Facility cost reporting as well
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
as as well as Nursing Facility cost
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
analysis to support our rate
 
00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:33.079 align:start position:0%
setting is there any questions on this
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
project which is estimated at
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
$800,000 in general funds or and will
 
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
have a 90% Federal match uh for a total
 
00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:52.789 --> 00:50:52.799 align:start position:0%
Abbott thank you Mr chairman um could
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
you tell me in your conversations with
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
um in his budget proposal this is his
 
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.829 align:start position:0%
um in his budget proposal this is his
number

00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
one uh concern well you're
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
discrepancy I I I apologize
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative Abbott I couldn't hear
 
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
your full
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
question asking why the the governor in
 
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
his budget has this as the number one
 
00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.990 align:start position:0%
his budget has this as the number one
priority

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
priority
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
your request it's the
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
11th thank you oh okay yeah thank you
 
00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:38.839 align:start position:0%
for the question uh representative Abbot
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
the the items on the governor's budget
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
are not in a priority order they were
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
just in there as
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
listed I believe they're they're
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
actually in alphabetical order they are
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
in alphabetical order in the government
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we will show a slide at
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
the end which shows our priorities order
 
00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:02.349 align:start position:0%
the end which shows our priorities order
the

00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
items I okay to move forward
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:12.799 align:start position:0%
ahead so moving away from the medic
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
management information system capital
 
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:17.720 align:start position:0%
projects now the this this specific
 
00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
project also in the governor's um um
 
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
submitt is what we call the what what is
 
00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
called the minimal acceptable risk of
 
00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
security and privacy controls for
 
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
exchanges or Mars e is what we call it
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
it is a requirement from our federal
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
partners for us to have this audit of
 
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
our integrated eligibility system which
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
is is as it say states in the name
 
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
integrated with our mmis but it is not
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
directly a Medicaid inter Medicaid
 
00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
management information system component
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
it is a separ separate system it is our
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
second largest system that DHHS runs
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
and in order to maintain that we have a
 
00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
requirement to do this audit every two
 
00:53:04.589 --> 00:53:04.599 align:start position:0%
years which takes an estimated 12 months
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
to complete we Outsource the funds um we
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
Outsource the solution to to our um
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
Partners to be able to work with us to
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
complete this this audit and this
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
assessment and Remediation and the
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
reason why we do that is not only do we
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
do the assessment but we actually have
 
00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:26.799 align:start position:0%
to re remediate the issues prior to
 
00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
submitt to the the center for Medicaid
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
and Medicare
 
00:53:34.829 --> 00:53:34.839 align:start position:0%
services this allows us to retain our or
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
75% match matching dollars for the
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
maintenance and operations of the
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
integrated eligibility system also
 
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
called New Heights and the funds
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
requested here is estimated $600,000
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
we've we have completed these several
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
times in the past and the general fund
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
expenditure for this is $60,000
 
00:54:01.789 --> 00:54:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
none this next project the developmental
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
Services Information Technology
 
00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:13.799 align:start position:0%

00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
um members of a of the house division 3
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
will hear more about u in the long-term

supports and services um presentation on
 
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
Monday is associated with the long-term

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
development developmental services and
 
00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
directly as a result to a
 
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
2016 LBA audit finding and what they
 
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
what they found is that the system was
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
unable to meet um the requirements that
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
we that we have both at the state and
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
the federal levels and that we need to
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
update this system from the current
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
process which is on a legacy I would say
 
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and access database
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
environment into modernized version of a
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
web-based information system to address
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
those federal and state
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
regulations we we did begin this work
 
00:55:09.549 --> 00:55:09.559 align:start position:0%
with an existing Capital project and and
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
we have been working in conjunction with
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
the integrated eligibility team and its
 
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
system and leveraging components from
 
00:55:19.789 --> 00:55:19.799 align:start position:0%
that as well as this next phase will
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
leverage the work accomplished on the
 
00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:25.039 align:start position:0%
division for children youth and families
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
um child welfare comprehensive child
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
welfare information system current well
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
using the Salesforce platform to
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
continue that work and instead of
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
duplicating the effort we are able to
 
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
leverage that platform forward and
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
continue to use that platform to reduce
 
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
our overall
 
00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:47.319 align:start position:0%
costs I'm going to go ahead and stop
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
there on this one but the if from a from
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
a funding perspective this is again
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
anticipated to be a fun fed by our our
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
center for Medicare and Medicaid
 
00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
services Federal Partners at
 
00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
90% and our general fund impact would be
 
00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.109 align:start position:0%
90% and our general fund impact would be
1,327

00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
1,327
 
00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
833 this one has a very specific number
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
as a result of us working with a
 
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
thirdparty vendor to do an assessment of
 
00:56:16.029 --> 00:56:16.039 align:start position:0%
the system and provide us a scope of
 
00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
work of how we can move forward and we
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
have um very good number uh very good
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
anticipation of what this one will cost
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
to implement in the timeline to
 
00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
questions and then we have also in the
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
long-term supports and Services Group we
 
00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
have a capital project requesting
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
funding to replace the Bureau for
 
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
developmental Services direct billing
 
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
solution another access database system
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
that has continuously
 
00:56:59.710 --> 00:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately um failed in the past
 
00:57:02.589 --> 00:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
requiring a lot of effort from our our
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
department of Information Technology
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
Partners to support us in our time of
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
need to continue this system forward and
 
00:57:10.589 --> 00:57:10.599 align:start position:0%
is a direct association with our
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan um that was
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
provided to us to that needs to be
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
implemented in order to maintain our
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
federal funding for services that we
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
currently have that Federal funding at
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
$181 million this system has objectives
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
to basically work with the mismis and
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
make make changes to that system which
 
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
would be included in the mmis life cycle
 
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
and reprocurement strategy but also
 
00:57:40.029 --> 00:57:40.039 align:start position:0%
update its billing processes update the
 
00:57:43.789 --> 00:57:43.799 align:start position:0%
service authorization um components with
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
the area agencies that they support and
 
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
and coordinate with as well as eliminate
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
manual processes that are
 
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.390 align:start position:0%
manual processes that are
currently

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:57:58.510 --> 00:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
um currently ending in error and
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
requiring duplicate effort as well as
 
00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.829 align:start position:0%
requiring duplicate effort as well as
inaccurate

00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:02.839 align:start position:0%
inaccurate
 
00:58:02.839 --> 00:58:04.349 align:start position:0%
inaccurate
reporting

00:58:04.349 --> 00:58:04.359 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
the the funds associated with this is
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
another is $100,000 in general funds and
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
with a 900,000 Federal funding
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
match any questions on the BDS direct
 
00:58:21.309 --> 00:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
billing seeing none uh thank you that's
 
00:58:25.789 --> 00:58:25.799 align:start position:0%
the last of what is currently in house
 
00:58:25.799 --> 00:58:27.549 align:start position:0%
the last of what is currently in house
bill

00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:27.559 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
25 um commissioner you want to continue
 
00:58:34.109 --> 00:58:34.119 align:start position:0%
on with the um information
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
technology and then go back to the
 
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
facilities as long as we're on a on a
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
rooll on it I will mention that um other
 
00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
agencies have come in with with multiple
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
additional requests and the fact that um
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
we are limited in what we can give right
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
now the requests total almost as much as
 
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
what the governor has proposed so and we
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
haven't heard from the University or the
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
community college system so we will
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
listen we surely do understand your
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
challenge I can appreciate it I I I
 
00:59:16.349 --> 00:59:16.359 align:start position:0%
agree representative Graham that it
 
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
makes sense to continue on with the uh
 
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
additional request for information
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
services and then we can hop back to the
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
facilities so Dave if you want to walk
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
us through that
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
especially since we're tired up
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
well so the the the other important
 
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
information technology requests that we
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
had submitted that did not make it on to
 
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget um
 
00:59:45.069 --> 00:59:45.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation um the first one here is
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
associated with our Bureau of elderly
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
adults Services System modernization it
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
would be continuing to evolve that
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
system which is a 23y old system um and
 
00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
it needs to be updated to a web-based
 
01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
service um and be accessible externally
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
it currently isn't ex externally
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
accessible requiring us to basically do
 
01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:08.119 align:start position:0%
reports send the data out to our
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
external partners and then have them
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
provide the data back to us so that we
 
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
can incorporate in into the
 
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
system this system is used to manage the
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
the elderly and Adult Services Bureau um
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
social worker case loads and the adult
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
protection program service authorization
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
provider payments um related to that
 
01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:32.039 align:start position:0%
Social Service block
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
grant over the last 10 years the the the
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
bureau's model has evolved to include a
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
higher percentage of field work by
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
social workers and and we subcontract
 
01:00:45.789 --> 01:00:45.799 align:start position:0%
with service link personnel and
 
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
contracted agencies to associate to do
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
this work and not having a system that
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
is accessible off off site has resulted
 
01:00:57.069 --> 01:00:57.079 align:start position:0%
in duplicate work where they're actually
 
01:00:59.789 --> 01:00:59.799 align:start position:0%
doing a manual process for their case
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
notes and case information and then
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
having to go back to to the state
 
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
Network to upload that data into the
 
01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
system and and act and then report on
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
that from from a perspective of what we
 
01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
need to do with the case management
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
nodes without the upgrade the new
 
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
business practices will not be able to
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
be supported in additional Personnel in
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
order to maintain the work would need to
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
be identified to continue to to actually
 
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
meet the demand for the case
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
loads the estimated U funding on this is
 
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
2.7 million in change for um federal
 
01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
funds and it was a larger majority of
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
General funds of $4 million and
 
01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
change and then this second one on this
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
slide is interoperability and
 
01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
integration we as part of the um cares
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
act we we began an implementation of uh
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
Clos Loop referral system to improve our
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
care um coordination to our services
 
01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the state that closed loop
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
referral system is gold at um
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
integrating our community based
 
01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
organizations Our Community Mental
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
Health Centers our federally qualified
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
Health Centers hospitals as well as our
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
education and juvenile just Justice
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
systems and then migrating into our
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
Managed Care Organization so that when
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
you have a referral for services no
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
matter where you're at you can get a
 
01:02:29.069 --> 01:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
referral through informed consent in a
 
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
hipa compliant environment so that we
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
can actually provide improved and faster
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
um services to our individuals as
 
01:02:41.789 --> 01:02:41.799 align:start position:0%
opposed to the current manual processes
 
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
resulting in a delay of those Services
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
um and as well as in additional to this
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire hospital was along
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Health and Human
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
Services was looking for uh Time Track
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
tracking and scheduling system and in
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
specifically for New Hampshire hospital
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
we were looking at acute um care time
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
tracking which is a very specific need
 
01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
that is not met by the current time
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
tracking system allowed um at the state
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
level and the the funding for this was
 
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
identified as a 33% match for General
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
funds at 2.6 million um 800 2.6 million
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
in change uh is there any questions on
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.319 --> 01:03:33.190 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
Newman yes thank you um on for the uh
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
Department priority number 13 for bullet
 
01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
number four how many additional
 
01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
Personnel is estimated could be required
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
if um if you don't have an
 
01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:54.200 align:start position:0%
upgrade any any
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
idea I what what I will do
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative Newman is I will reach
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
back out to our division director and
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
identify what those numbers are and make
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
sure I have that answer for you okay all
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
right I would ask that you reach out
 
01:04:14.829 --> 01:04:14.839 align:start position:0%
soon um like by next
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
Wednesday thank you representative Grant
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I will certainly have that that
 
01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
update by next Wednesday I would
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate having it to to you by Monday
 
01:04:29.069 --> 01:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
provide it to Mr Shay so that he can get
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
it out to everybody absolutely thank you
 
01:04:31.839 --> 01:04:35.309 align:start position:0%
it out to everybody absolutely thank you
Mr

01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
chair and then the LA the last two um
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
important it requests I got
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative evil well I can wait
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
until until he's done but um and this is
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
backtracking a little bit am I right
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
that the BDS that uh direct billing that
 
01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
was included in the governor's budget
 
01:04:57.789 --> 01:04:57.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't on your priority list or maybe
 
01:05:02.829 --> 01:05:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
have I will need to check that but I
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
believe the BDS direct billing was
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
should have been on our priority list it
 
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
pro it probably excuse me it probably
 
01:05:16.589 --> 01:05:16.599 align:start position:0%
was but we only have one through 11 so
 
01:05:16.599 --> 01:05:19.829 align:start position:0%
was but we only have one through 11 so
and

01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
I okay I I will validate that and have
 
01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:26.599 align:start position:0%
that answer to Mr Shay as well thank
 
01:05:32.109 --> 01:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
Graham so back in June when the um
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
Governor's capital budget hearings
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
occurred that was on their um priority
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
list that that BDS direct billing was
 
01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
Project number
 
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
five it did not make it into the um
 
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
Capital improvement book that you all
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
have the blue book where you see the 11
 
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
projects uh listed that the governor had
 
01:05:59.789 --> 01:05:59.799 align:start position:0%
further work done on um with the Bureau
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
of um public works or
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
doit so in fact the the Health and Human
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
Services had a total of 25 projects that
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
they requested back in June and there
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
was a document that I sent to you
 
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
several weeks ago which was a summary
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
document of of all those um
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
requests and I can resend that to the
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
thank you I would too yeah I'll I'll
 
01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
resend it then yeah thank you Mr Shay
 
01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:41.230 align:start position:0%
resend it then yeah thank you Mr Shay
representative

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
Abbott yes um I'm showing that is number
 
01:06:54.029 --> 01:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
government of serves direct
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
billing um I think that we covered that
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
that it is there and that these are in
 
01:07:08.109 --> 01:07:08.119 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget just um
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
alphabetically and not prioritized by um
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
there that's correct see any no other
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
questions on these two okay okay thank
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair the the last two projects
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
that we have are um surrounding Public
 
01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
Health requests for their ability to do
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
lead U lead poisoning prevention as well
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
as um analyze water in for for pasas
 
01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
specifically so this first one
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
Environmental Health Data System is to
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
request three Antiquated homemade access
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
databases um and five linked Excel
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets that have caused some some
 
01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
challenges with data integrity and
 
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
accuracy and replace it with a
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Environmental Health Data
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
System that will take care of the data
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
management storage associated with
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
healthy homes and lead poisoning
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
prevention program so this current
 
01:08:16.829 --> 01:08:16.839 align:start position:0%
program is running on those access and
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
Excel spreadsheets and it it's really
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
outgrown um that homegrown system and we
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
are estimating um a $250,000
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
investment in a web-based
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
application would bring us into U A
 
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
system that not only has the ability to
 
01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
meet the lead poisoning prevention
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
program but also address the current um
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
data accuracy in Integrity components of
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
that system and then this last one the
 
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
pasas Environmental water testing
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
equipment is a request to purchase a
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
liquid chromat chromatograph or and mass
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
spectrometry system for for um water
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
testing in minor
 
01:09:01.709 --> 01:09:01.719 align:start position:0%
renovation this in minor res renovation
 
01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
to the public health lab space so to
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
allow for that testing the purchase of
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
the instrument and this renovation will
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
allow the New Hampshire Public Health
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
Labs to um effectively test
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
environmental samples specifically water
 
01:09:16.199 --> 01:09:17.910 align:start position:0%
environmental samples specifically water
for

01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
past I have a question about that last
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
one last year the legislature
 
01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:31.719 align:start position:0%
um approve $50 million for pfas um
 
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
remediation can you not tap into that
 
01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.390 align:start position:0%
remediation can you not tap into that
for

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
$430,000 I I will um seek to see if we
 
01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
can do that representative
 
01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
Graham thank you it just I would hate to
 
01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
duplicate efforts since that 50 million
 
01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.950 --> 01:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
and that that would bring me to the end
 
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
of the information technology um
 
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
additional requests so I would pass this
 
01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
back to you I have another question from
 
01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.750 align:start position:0%
back to you I have another question from
representative

01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
eel thank you um so if I read uh that
 
01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
priority number 25
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
correctly who's doing the testing now or
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
is there a lot of it being outsourced or
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
how is that
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
working currently if the if the public
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
health lab was requested to do the
 
01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
testing they would need to Outsource it
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
to a third party and pay for that to be
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
done elsewhere um I believe maybe
 
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner gulay do you have
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
Weaver what I can do is I I will also
 
01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
research that to get it I can't hear
 
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.149 align:start position:0%
research that to get it I can't hear
them

01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
I don't have any additional information
 
01:11:05.229 --> 01:11:05.239 align:start position:0%

gou what I what I will do M
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative eil is I will follow up
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
with our Public Health Labs and ID and
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
validate my statement and and also
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
address that to Mr Shay as
 
01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
well thank you um commissioner Weaver

Philbrook site uh I'm gonna ask Dave
 
01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
clap to um come back to us to to talk
 
01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
about these were priorities 9 10 and 15
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
in our list that didn't get approved by
 
01:12:18.629 --> 01:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget but do have a a a
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
request to be
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
considered if as you go through I we
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
have several new members so if you could
 
01:12:31.149 --> 01:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
at least talk about where
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
these um facilities are would be helpful
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
sure Dave are you on the line yes I
 
01:12:40.159 --> 01:12:41.830 align:start position:0%
sure Dave are you on the line yes I
am

01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
am
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
the priority number nine that we had was
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh syc roof Bond roof replacement that's
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
at the um cunu Youth Center the old YDC
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
property these are the external build
 
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
bus um to the syc the sununu center
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
itself um that were used for support and
 
01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
they were still used for some support
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
now storage and uh some programs the
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
bond roof has well P passed its useful
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
life it has been leaking for a number of
 
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
years and we've been trying to get this
 
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
replaced um at least four years that I
 
01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:22.870 align:start position:0%
replaced um at least four years that I
know

01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
of the it is actually to the point that
 
01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
the water is migrating interior to the
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
building and will be starting to cause
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
structural damage to the the bond if it
 
01:13:38.229 --> 01:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
is not taken care of soon we are
 
01:13:38.239 --> 01:13:40.790 align:start position:0%
is not taken care of soon we are
requesting

01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
$325,000 uh all of that General funds
 
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
roof uh the next priority number 10 is
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
again uh the bond boiler replacement
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
this boiler handles again is at uh the
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
syc shuna youth center and handles all
 
01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
the external buildings from the actual
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
use Center itself um there's I believe
 
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
eight buildings that are receive heating
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
from the U boiler at the
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
bond uh it had a uh problem with a power
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
fluctuation shut down and froze um and
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
serviceable um the next is at the Glen
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
Cliffe um home up in Benton New
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is the same location that
 
01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the roof for the Lamont
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
building uh the Glen Cliffe wastewater
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
treatment site has it own wastewater
 
01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
treatment system the system is failed uh
 
01:15:01.709 --> 01:15:01.719 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
in um getting close to having violations
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
from Dees for groundwater
 
01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
contamination uh because of it so it it
 
01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:15.830 align:start position:0%
contamination uh because of it so it it
is

01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
a priority as as far as we're concerned
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
addressed and just as I said we have uh
 
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
several new members on the committee
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
what is Glen Cliffe just so the people
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
know Glen Cliffe is a uh facility that
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
was originally used for tuberculosis has
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
been turned more into a um nursing home
 
01:15:49.149 --> 01:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
for people with um acute issues as far
 
01:15:49.159 --> 01:15:50.350 align:start position:0%
for people with um acute issues as far
as

01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:15:54.669 --> 01:15:54.679 align:start position:0%
um uh let me see Alzheimer's um and so
 
01:15:54.679 --> 01:15:57.310 align:start position:0%
um uh let me see Alzheimer's um and so
forth

01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.790 align:start position:0%
 
thank

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
you any questions on uh any of these
 
01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:04.870 align:start position:0%
you any questions on uh any of these
three

01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
items yeah I I have one representative
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
Newman yes thank you going back to uh
 
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliffe if the system is is
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
determined to be failed right now how
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
long reasonably is it before um uh there
 
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
are going to be citations and penalties
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
and whatever ever how long does that
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
take that's a good question the we're
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
working to maintain the system and keep
 
01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
it from getting to the point of being um
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
penalized by Dees on that uh we are not
 
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
at that point yet but I don't know how
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
long uh we can continue to do
 
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
it it could be a year it could be four
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
years I'm we're just we're working to
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
try to maintain it and keep it in in a u
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
fashion all right thank you you're
 
01:17:11.310 --> 01:17:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
Thompson representative Thompson you
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
ask um with respect to the um Wastewater
 
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
system what type of system is there
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
currently it's called a fielded system
 
01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
they have it's a buildup of sand as a
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
filter medium and the over the years the
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
filter medium does build up with solids
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
and U we do treat for that and that's
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
where we're at now it's it's the bed has
 
01:17:50.629 --> 01:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
broken down to the point that we it's
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
requiring a lot more service to maintain
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
operational follow up Mr chairman follow
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
up um is what are you going to rep try
 
01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
to replace it with must have something
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
in mind if you've got a $1.2 million
 
01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
figure yes see what we're looking at
 
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
doing is replacing the full sandbed uh
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
the receiving system coming from the
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
facility the uh treatment tank the
 
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
pre-treatment tank before it goes into
 
01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.590 align:start position:0%
pre-treatment tank before it goes into
the

01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
field okay okay thank you very much
 
01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative eel thank you
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um Mr clap recognizing that we
 
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
have constraints on what we can budget
 
01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.070 align:start position:0%
have constraints on what we can budget
is

01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
there is there a way that we could help
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
with this by perhaps appropriating a
 
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
little more do you need engineering
 
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
money is
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
there I know you want it all but is
 
01:18:53.149 --> 01:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
there a a halfway house in in any way
 
01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
here we visit the place I have some
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
sense of it yeah um it's it's hard to
 
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
say I mean that cost is an all-in cost
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
for engineering and so forth we have had
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
it looked at multiple times and it does
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
get inspected by Dees on a regular basis
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
um we we're working to try to keep it
 
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
functioning as long as we can um that's
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
the best I can say I mean it really
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
needs a full replacement
 
01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:27.110 align:start position:0%
needs a full replacement
thank

01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:31.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:34.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
Ms and I I think for the for the next
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
two I'd like if Joe Kirsty could speak
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
to the uh next
 
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
two sure um so again I'm Joe kisy the
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
CFO for New Hampshire hospital uh for
 
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
priority number 16 New Hampshire
 
01:19:51.629 --> 01:19:51.639 align:start position:0%
hospital security system upgrades uh so
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is a a project aimed at trying to
 
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.189 align:start position:0%
this is a a project aimed at trying to
improve

01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
improve
 
01:19:58.510 --> 01:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh staff and patient safety on the units
 
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
um we currently have uh you know
 
01:20:03.390 --> 01:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
multiple units in the hospital and each
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
one of the units has its own uh unique
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
security system bought at a different
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
point in time uh all of those systems
 
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
are are quite outdated we actually had
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
one uh fail this past year um and we
 
01:20:17.709 --> 01:20:17.719 align:start position:0%
couldn't find parts uh so we had to
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
replace the uh the entire system uh so
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
this would help replace a lot of our uh
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
kind of uh camera and surveillance
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
equipment throughout the building um and
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
then also include um a a new
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
communication technology for staff uh so
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
the hospital on an annual basis um uh we
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
have about I'm looking at our statement
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
of appropriation real quick here uh we
 
01:20:47.950 --> 01:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
have $970,000 a year budgeted for
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
workers compensation claims um and uh
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
this is really an attempt to try to help
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
reduce some of those
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
um employee related injuries who might
 
01:20:59.790 --> 01:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
be at the end of a hallway no great way
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
to communicate to their peers uh this
 
01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
this type of system would allow us to
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
increase communication uh up and down
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
our corridors uh for for staff and
 
01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
patient safety um so that's priority
 
01:21:17.629 --> 01:21:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
one see none
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay uh priority number 17 New Hampshire
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
hospital flooring upgrades uh so the
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
again New Hampshire hospital was built
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
in 1989 a lot of our Furnishings are
 
01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
still original to to that date um
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
additionally we have a fairly extensive
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
amount of carpet in the building uh and
 
01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
uh which really is not great from an
 
01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
infection control standard perspective
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh and regulations are increasingly
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
going more towards not allowing uh
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
carpets or other types of fomite
 
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
surfaces to be inside a healthc care
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
facility um we do anticipate that will
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
also uh uh be uh further pushed um now
 
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
that the covid-19 pandemic has happened
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
um fortunately in this past year um we
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
have been able uh or or we hope to be
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
able to use some covid-19 money we the
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
hospital received to replace some of our
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
flooring um and so this would be uh just
 
01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:18.210 align:start position:0%
the remaining portion of
 
01:22:18.210 --> 01:22:20.910 align:start position:0%
the remaining portion of
[Music]

01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.229 --> 01:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
great and the last one we have here is
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
the demon demolition of the Wilkins
 
01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
building I think Dave is still on the
 
01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:34.470 align:start position:0%
building I think Dave is still on the
line

01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
yes um the Wilkins building is located
 
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
on the senu campus down in um Manchester
 
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
the building suffered a catastrophic
 
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
fire about six years ago and has been
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
deemed um
 
01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:52.510 align:start position:0%
deemed um
structurally

01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
structurally
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
um reduced so in working with public
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
works and the State Historical um they
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
have agreed to allow us to have that
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
taken down the building is in extreme
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
disrepair and it's unstable uh there are
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
sections of the building that could
 
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
collapse we have cordoned off the area
 
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
but we do get um
 
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
local uh youth that violate that fencing
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
and do get into to the area we try to
 
01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:27.639 align:start position:0%
keep them away from there as much as
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
possible and that's why we're calling it
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
a safety issue we do not want to see any
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:42.189 --> 01:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
injured see no questions on that
 
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner I I have a overall question
 
01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
on the last two
 
01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
slides if we were to begin to look
 
01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
at um funding anything additional in
 
01:23:56.430 --> 01:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
your facilities request these are the
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
priorities that you would want them to
 
01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
do be
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
in yep I'm just trying to catch up with
 
01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:03.709 align:start position:0%
in yep I'm just trying to catch up with
you

01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
there U my computer's moving very slowly
 
01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
it's uh starts with the barn roof
 
01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.510 align:start position:0%
it's uh starts with the barn roof
replacement

01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
and yes so this slide here so the the
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
prior slide to that is is I think it was
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
asked prior about the order it is you'll
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
notice it is different than the order of
 
01:24:28.110 --> 01:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget this is uh our
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
priority for the 11 that the governor
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
has approved and the very last slide
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
here would be the other important
 
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
requests um and I do not believe
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure if these are Mary or
 
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
do you know if Mary kiss if you're still
 
01:24:47.709 --> 01:24:47.719 align:start position:0%
on the line if these are in priority
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
order I do not know that they are or not
 
01:24:53.109 --> 01:24:53.119 align:start position:0%
in order of
 
01:24:55.629 --> 01:24:55.639 align:start position:0%
priority okay commissioner I would I
 
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
would ask that you redo that slide and
 
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
send it to the committee in priority
 
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
order um so that we can see if there are
 
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
any additional funds
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
available um what we could or could not
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
um fit into it rather than us looking at
 
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
this list going oh I like number nine or
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
not um number nine you didn't even talk
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
about really really
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
um correct so I can absolutely do that
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
for you I will uh make sure that that is
 
01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
in a priority order and then send it
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
over to Chris and on your very first
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
slides you showed um a breakout of
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
versus um Federal funding how we
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
leveraged that but you were at the 145
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
million figure with that uh pie chart
 
01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
could you send us one or send me one at
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
least that shows it um at what the
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
governor has
 
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
proposed in case you don't get any more
 
01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.910 align:start position:0%
proposed in case you don't get any more
money

01:26:08.910 --> 01:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
certainly thank
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
you and I think that with several people
 
01:26:20.669 --> 01:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
at least one on here would like to ask a
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
question while we have all of your your
 
01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
staff there
 
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
about the proposal for the forensic
 
01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospital that is compl
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
contained in two different bills and two
 
01:26:36.990 --> 01:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
different bodies of the general
 
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
court sure yes I understand there was a
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
little bit of confusion about the
 
01:26:43.229 --> 01:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
difference between the the number of
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
beds um what is that correct that what
 
01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:47.709 align:start position:0%
beds um what is that correct that what
you're

01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:47.719 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
referencing that is correct one one I
 
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
believe says 25 House Bill two says 60
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
60 correct so last bium uh this was
 
01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
obviously uh something that was a big
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
discussion and was put into the budget
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
we were required to do an assessment and
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
look at what the current need is and at
 
01:27:11.950 --> 01:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
that time uh we assessed the need at 60
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
beds uh what was funded in the budget
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
was 25
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
beds so that is the difference between
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
where we were at uh two years ago and
 
01:27:25.229 --> 01:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
what got funded so we now have that
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
discrepancy it is the
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
intention to build out a facility that
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
will uh ultimately uh be able to
 
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
eventually house 60 so it is the
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
intention to build a facility that will
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
house 25 uh have 25 beds uh potentially
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
with the first floor and then to be keep
 
01:27:49.629 --> 01:27:49.639 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure to build potentially
 
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
a second floor where we could fill the
 
01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
remainder of those uh beds getting to
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
six but not fill them right now because
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
we won't have the money to do the fill
 
01:27:59.669 --> 01:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
full build on that but we will have the
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
money to do the fill full build on the
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
25 I
 
01:28:11.709 --> 01:28:11.719 align:start position:0%
would suggest you you look very strongly
 
01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
at that in the future build another
 
01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
floor I I know that another agency has
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
been talking about building a third
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
floor under their facility for many
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
years and we still haven't got around to
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
it um so just look at if you get the
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
money the money in House Bill 2
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
sufficient to do the complete building
 
01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
or is it only
 
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
for um the 25
 
01:28:45.109 --> 01:28:45.119 align:start position:0%
beds that is what we're in the process
 
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
of revisiting since two years has gone
 
01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:49.400 align:start position:0%
by and we're working with D and Public
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
Works to look at the money that's
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
appropriated on the 25 does the 25 uh
 
01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
it's ultimately we have 8 million in
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
this budget right now uh and the 17.2
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
the 1725 and hb2 would be the 25 million
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
for the 25 beds or how much further
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
beyond that can we go hb2 does allow us
 
01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
to uh bond out if and borrow money if we
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
need to do that extension to be able to
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
to do that build if we don't have enough
 
01:29:19.390 --> 01:29:19.400 align:start position:0%
money and yes we know that there is the
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
potential to bond that um it raised some
 
01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
concern among the members of the
 
01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:27.400 align:start position:0%
committee that this committee was not
 
01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
involved in any of those
 
01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
discussions um just so that you know I
 
01:29:37.149 --> 01:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
have asked uh Finance as they go through
 
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:41.719 align:start position:0%
house bill to to provide a um an
 
01:29:44.189 --> 01:29:44.199 align:start position:0%
amendment to that that would require
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
your department to report to the the
 
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
Capal budget overview committee on the
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
progress of that that um project
 
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of the fund
 
01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.590 align:start position:0%
regardless of the fund

01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
up any other questions that you have on
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
Capital I have a question from
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.750 --> 01:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
unmute down there there found
 
01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
it I was just curious if this with all
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
these technological advances in the
 
01:30:40.030 --> 01:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
systems is it going to require a net
 
01:30:42.990 --> 01:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
increase or net decrease in
 
01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
budget that's a that's a really good
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you for the question and
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
Dave you I'll turn that over to you
 
01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:55.189 align:start position:0%
Dave you I'll turn that over to you
first

01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
01:31:00.030 --> 01:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
representative Mr chair um most of the
 
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
technological advances are actually gold
 
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
at keeping the current staff as it is
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
however like in the mmis group we have
 
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
been running v um six vacant positions
 
01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:15.400 align:start position:0%
um to support that system and which has
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
resulted in a delay in actually being
 
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
able to um enhance those systems and
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
additionally with all the additional
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
projects for the Medicaid management
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
information system we we are seeking
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
additional positions for that um in the
 
01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
I think it's two positions that we're
 
01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
looking for for that and in funding to
 
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
manage those projects once those
 
01:31:40.510 --> 01:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
projects are are over they would be able
 
01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
to maintain the existing systems as it
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
goes forward but to be more clear the
 
01:31:49.709 --> 01:31:49.719 align:start position:0%
technology is goal at taking manual
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
processes and um not and not
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
overburdening our existing staff and
 
01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
addressing some of the delays that we've
 
01:31:59.070 --> 01:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
resulted in those manual processes so
 
01:32:01.229 --> 01:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
that we do not have to add additional
 
01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:03.719 align:start position:0%
Staffing um commissioner weaver or
 
01:32:05.310 --> 01:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Weaver did you have
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
anything else to add no I think you
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
answered that thank
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
sorry um Mr waiters uh I guess my
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
question is back to the it um issues and
 
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
the penalties that we've been assessed
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
by the federal government do you have a
 
01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
total of what those penalties amount to
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
in the LA I guess it would begin at the
 
01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
last beginning of the last bium up to
 
01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:54.750 align:start position:0%
last beginning of the last bium up to
current

01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
um certainly representative Thompson Mr
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
chair uh the current penalties are
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
actually associated with electronic
 
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
visit verification they have not been
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
enacted on us yet so we we anticipate
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
seeing those that first penalty um at
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
the end of this month um from from our
 
01:33:11.639 --> 01:33:12.669 align:start position:0%
the end of this month um from from our
federal

01:33:12.669 --> 01:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
partners and and then every quarter
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
after that we would see those penalties
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
$860,000 of estimated um um penalties
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
would be quarterly each so one in one
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
for January through March of this fiscal
 
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
year one through April through June and
 
01:33:36.109 --> 01:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
then continuing every quarter after that
 
01:33:38.109 --> 01:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
um there are no other penalties that
 
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
we've seen um what we have been
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
indicated by our our center for Medicare
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid services is that
 
01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
what what's called an advanced planning
 
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
document it's the document that we need
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
to submit to our to CMS to indicate what
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
we're doing with our
 
01:33:58.109 --> 01:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
mismis that expires the federal funding
 
01:34:01.109 --> 01:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
for that system expires June 30th and we
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
have to resubmit a document showing how
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
we're funding the life cycle management
 
01:34:09.070 --> 01:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
as well as the reprocurement strategy
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
for the system by June 30th with um with
 
01:34:14.669 --> 01:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
our approved strategy in order to
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
maintain our certification of that
 
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
system so those again would be feature
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
bium next next bium penalties if they
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.149 --> 01:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
us follow up Mr chairman follow
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
up um in the beginning of your
 
01:34:37.950 --> 01:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
presentation you referenced the $900,000
 
01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:39.790 align:start position:0%
presentation you referenced the $900,000
uh

01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.310 --> 01:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
assessed thank you representative
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
Thompson I
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
didn't so I may I may have Mis misspoken
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
what what I'm indicating is that we are
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
already non-compliant with electronic
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
visit verification for the months of
 
01:35:02.669 --> 01:35:02.679 align:start position:0%
January February and now beginning of
 
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
March and until such time that we
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
Implement an electronic visit
 
01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
verification we will be penalized at
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
that 0.25% for this for this Federal
 
01:35:14.669 --> 01:35:14.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and then it will go up to 1%
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
of our personal care services costs
 
01:35:19.629 --> 01:35:19.639 align:start position:0%
which we estimated for this fiscal year
 
01:35:24.189 --> 01:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
at 864,000 and it it may be more or less
 
01:35:27.149 --> 01:35:27.159 align:start position:0%
depending on our our final reports to
 
01:35:31.870 --> 01:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
them um and so when I indicated about a
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
$900,000 penalty that's what we're
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
anticipating for this fiscal year
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
regardless if we get the funding for
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
this Capital project um at this time we
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
would not be able to implement
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
electronic visit verification system um
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
to meet that January 1st 2021 deadline
 
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
to avoid that
 
01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
penalty I apologize as I took my note
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
um I wrote the 900,000 down and then the
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
864 under it I didn't know they were the
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
same figure roughly they are they are
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
roughly the same figure represent
 
01:36:11.310 --> 01:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
than thank you um I'd like to go back to
 
01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
the spu just
 
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
to understand a little bit better so um
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
so the total amount that you're
 
01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
anticipating the building will be is 25
 
01:36:25.709 --> 01:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
million um so so there's 8 million
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
roughly that was appropriated last year
 
01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
I guess that was carried over that's my
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
understanding and now what's in hb2 is
 
01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
7.25 million and it's anticipated that a
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
decent hunk of that is going to come out
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
of fed funds I wondered if you could
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
talk about the federal fund aspect of it
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
because to the extent that it's not
 
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
covered by federal funds I think we'll
 
01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
be looking uh increasingly at our
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
bonding capacity for it so since we're
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
the bonding Geeks here any Enlightenment
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
you could share would be great I may
 
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
need to turn to Joe kisti in terms of
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
the federal I I don't I'm not um in
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the billing and how we would do
 
01:37:11.950 --> 01:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
that uh or for the patients I'm really
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
not clear on that I know that for the
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
building we were appropriated a a set
 
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
amount of money um we asked for a
 
01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
certain amount we got budgeted the 25 to
 
01:37:24.669 --> 01:37:24.679 align:start position:0%
build with the 25 but in terms of the
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
future in the federal Joe might be able
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.510 --> 01:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
could um sure I think um that is a a
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
question that I I might have to um
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
connect with a few folks uh within HHS
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
and try to get you an answer back um in
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
terms of billing for the facility it's
 
01:37:49.709 --> 01:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's dependent uh upon uh kind
 
01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
of final design and so forth uh as to
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not um
 
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
it it kind of meets a certain level of
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
standard that can be built for so um I I
 
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a great answer for that but
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
we can certainly um uh connect amongst
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
the department and uh and send some or
 
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
submit something to uh Mr Shay uh for
 
01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
the committee um followup Mr chair
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
followup I just want to say one whatever
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
you prepare for us I am sure that
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
finance will be asking the same
 
01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
questions right I mean that's basically
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
what I was going to say say I think this
 
01:38:26.589 --> 01:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
is probably an evolving discussion and
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
so you know I I think based on what the
 
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
chair said as well if you could keep us
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
surprised because things start end up
 
01:38:37.070 --> 01:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
getting put in the capital budget that
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
we aren't really weighing in on that
 
01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
much and we just really are responsible
 
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
for overseeing it my other question is
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
simpler where are you planning to build
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
this the magic
 
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
location um at the time that we were uh
 
01:38:57.629 --> 01:38:57.639 align:start position:0%
looking at two years ago uh was here in
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
conquered on the State Office Park South
 
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
Campus which is pretty uh approximately
 
01:39:04.510 --> 01:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
across from New Hampshire hospital the
 
01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
abutment of this between the property
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
that abuts Clinton Street and fruit
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
street so it would be adjacent to the
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
filberg building and um depending on
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
where you're standing in front of or
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
behind the the um New Hampshire hospital
 
01:39:23.189 --> 01:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
that is about the only piece of property
 
01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh that on left on this campus uh that
 
01:39:28.709 --> 01:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
we would have any uh space to build and
 
01:39:30.109 --> 01:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
as you know there's the restrictions in
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
this campus in terms of the historical
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh buildings and restrictions um it is
 
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
corner representative Jack uh thank you
 
01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh Mr weers I was uh
 
01:39:45.589 --> 01:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
surprised to see the number of times
 
01:39:47.950 --> 01:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
that the words access database appeared
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
in the slide deck uh if you're like me
 
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
you know what year that came out do we
 
01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
have other systems you didn't call out
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:01.470 --> 01:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
old thank you representative Jack um
 
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
definitely we have several access
 
01:40:06.109 --> 01:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
databases um I would it's too numerous
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
to count um managing different systems
 
01:40:11.950 --> 01:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
these are the the critical systems that
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
we submitted so we we definitely have
 
01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
lots of projects that we could submit
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
what we what we did is we submitted our
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
our priority and most critical items
 
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
that are addressing the services
 
01:40:27.229 --> 01:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
directly right now and what we're trying
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
to do is with these bigger platforms is
 
01:40:33.589 --> 01:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
replace multiple access databases
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
that're doing many like many specific or
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
what I call a point solution um and make
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
it so that we can have a a team of
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
people doing many different services
 
01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
with one platform so that what these um
 
01:40:50.830 --> 01:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
capital projects will do is move a lot
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
of those access databases that we didn't
 
01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned every single one into these
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
platforms and continue to grow um away
 
01:41:02.109 --> 01:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
from access and Excel as being a systems
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
approach um which was the the current
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
process without with due to lack of
 
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
funding for these bigger S these bigger
 
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
you seeing no other hands raised
 
01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:20.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner do you have anything final
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
you would like to say I would like to
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
say thank you to all of you for your
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
time and attention and excellent
 
01:41:29.070 --> 01:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
questions uh regarding our capital
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
budget and I will follow up with Mr Shay
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
on all of the items today um and uh
 
01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:40.440 align:start position:0%

joining us um because there is a big
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
chunk of it in this and it's always nice
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
to know that you're in there with them
 
01:41:58.510 --> 01:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
as a as a partner in all of
 
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
this um with that our next presentation
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
is not until
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
11:30 the committee will stand in recess
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
until 11:30 when we'll hear from police
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
standards and training
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.229 --> 01:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
and doing this fully remote I don't know
 
01:42:45.070 --> 01:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
how to put something up that tells
 
01:42:48.990 --> 01:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
11:30 I'm calling the fourth floor about
 
01:42:54.030 --> 01:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
that right now
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%

between quarter 12 and I should be back
 
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
by 12:30 so I just want to apologize for
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
that oh no problem I'm not sure how long
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh police standards and training will
 
01:43:40.510 --> 01:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
actually take they only have one request
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
um and then we'll be breaking for
 
01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:46.280 align:start position:0%

today the proof will be when we get to
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%

02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
our Indoor Firing Range which was
 
02:06:02.109 --> 02:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
installed in
 
02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
1992 our Firearms range is used to train
 
02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
all full-time part-time and State
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
Corrections Academy recruits along with
 
02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
several inservice Firearms classes that
 
02:06:14.669 --> 02:06:14.679 align:start position:0%
we uh hold
 
02:06:17.390 --> 02:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
annually after 28 years of continuous
 
02:06:19.709 --> 02:06:19.719 align:start position:0%
usage the range ventilation and
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
filtration system is showing signs of
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
fatigue and the filter frames are
 
02:06:27.310 --> 02:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
warping and sagging the ventilation
 
02:06:30.390 --> 02:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
system must work at Peak efficiency and
 
02:06:32.950 --> 02:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness as it is a life safety
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
device that removes dangerous and toxic
 
02:06:37.750 --> 02:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
particles from the air during firearms
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
training with live
 
02:06:41.870 --> 02:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
ammunition further the range duck work
 
02:06:44.270 --> 02:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
located at the back of the range which
 
02:06:47.229 --> 02:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
culminates on the Tactical Center roof
 
02:06:49.149 --> 02:06:49.159 align:start position:0%
is weather damaged and is causing
 
02:06:52.390 --> 02:06:52.400 align:start position:0%

02:06:53.790 --> 02:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:06:56.430 --> 02:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
insulation it is unknown what the extent
 
02:06:58.270 --> 02:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
of the suspected deterioration of the
 
02:07:01.549 --> 02:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
fan motors are with the upgrade to a
 
02:07:03.470 --> 02:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
more energy efficient ventilation and
 
02:07:06.270 --> 02:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
filtration system and possible revamp of
 
02:07:09.229 --> 02:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
the variable frequency drive controls it
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
will ensure that this life life safety
 
02:07:13.990 --> 02:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
device is running at Peak efficiency and
 
02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:15.719 align:start position:0%
help with the agency goal of reduction
 
02:07:18.990 --> 02:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
of fossil fuel uh cost reduction set
 
02:07:22.990 --> 02:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
forth in that same executive order
 
02:07:24.990 --> 02:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
this project will also help decrease the
 
02:07:27.669 --> 02:07:27.679 align:start position:0%
state's utility
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
consumption I thank you for uh your time
 
02:07:32.589 --> 02:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
and your consideration and I stand ready
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that any member
 
02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:38.549 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that any member
might

02:07:38.549 --> 02:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:42.069 --> 02:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
have I will jump in at the very
 
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
beginning because I'm sure several
 
02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
others have got the same question at the
 
02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
very beginning of your um testimony you
 
02:07:54.589 --> 02:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
190,000 for the AC
 
02:08:00.109 --> 02:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
units and
 
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
4,000 for the range ventilation and
 
02:08:06.430 --> 02:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
filtration upgrade in the governor's
 
02:08:09.669 --> 02:08:09.679 align:start position:0%
proposal and in the uh
 
02:08:13.229 --> 02:08:13.239 align:start position:0%
hp25 those figures are
 
02:08:16.109 --> 02:08:16.119 align:start position:0%
475,000 for the Air Conditional
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
Replacements and 850,000 for the range
 
02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:22.229 align:start position:0%
Replacements and 850,000 for the range
ventilation

02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
ventilation
 
02:08:24.709 --> 02:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
um I'm more than willing to reduce your
 
02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
requests to what you're asking for in
 
02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
your testimony but I was trying to
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
correct uh chairman Graham I uh deeply
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
apologize uh I believe that uh I'm I'm
 
02:08:45.149 --> 02:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
working from a document that uh was
 
02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
produced prior to my appointment here
 
02:08:53.149 --> 02:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
and um it is uh uh I uh I take the
 
02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility for for uh not
 
02:08:58.350 --> 02:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
reconciling the numbers that are in the
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
present budget that's my fault and I
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you representative Jack
 
02:09:07.470 --> 02:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
director uh some years ago we uh gave
 
02:09:13.549 --> 02:09:13.559 align:start position:0%
you money to redo the pursuit driving uh
 
02:09:16.149 --> 02:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
range and I was wondering uh that seemed
 
02:09:19.069 --> 02:09:19.079 align:start position:0%
to be a safety issue I was wondering if
 
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
that got finished and how it's working
 
02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:22.910 align:start position:0%
that got finished and how it's working
out

02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:09:24.750 --> 02:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you sir uh actually it's
 
02:09:28.149 --> 02:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
working out uh very well if if you
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
listen in the background you might even
 
02:09:31.390 --> 02:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
hear some squealing tires because
 
02:09:35.229 --> 02:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
they're using it today so um it's been
 
02:09:39.229 --> 02:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
um uh working out very well for us I do
 
02:09:43.149 --> 02:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
think that we are looking to uh just put
 
02:09:46.109 --> 02:09:46.119 align:start position:0%
a seal coat over the top of uh that
 
02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
project just to uh ensure that we can
 
02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
get as much life of it uh life out of it
 
02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:59.069 align:start position:0%
get as much life of it uh life out of it
as

02:09:59.069 --> 02:09:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:05.709 --> 02:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:09.549 --> 02:10:09.559 align:start position:0%
director um director if you would like
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
to oh wait a minute representative
 
02:10:16.750 --> 02:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
Mills uh yes thank you Mr chair uh so
 
02:10:18.109 --> 02:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
I'm still trying to figure out whether
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
or not the request is actually for 475
 
02:10:25.629 --> 02:10:25.639 align:start position:0%
$5,000 for these units or 190 we've
 
02:10:27.589 --> 02:10:27.599 align:start position:0%
determined that there's a mistake on one
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
of these Pages which one is
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
it uh representative Mills I I am going
 
02:10:35.109 --> 02:10:35.119 align:start position:0%
to accept full responsibility for that
 
02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
mistake and I would ask that um my my
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
testimony reflect uh the numbers that
 
02:10:42.069 --> 02:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
are in the governor's
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
budget uh followup please yes sir
 
02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
followup um then uh I take it these
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
eight air conditioning units which
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
obviously working out to be about uh50
 
02:10:56.149 --> 02:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
$60,000 a piece these aren't window
 
02:10:59.709 --> 02:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
units uh what what kind of units are
 
02:11:02.669 --> 02:11:02.679 align:start position:0%
they that the that eight units cost this
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
kind of is this all for one building or
 
02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:05.830 align:start position:0%
kind of is this all for one building or
separate

02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
separate
 
02:11:09.189 --> 02:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
buildings the um uh I'm looking at the
 
02:11:12.149 --> 02:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
my uh plant uh managing maintenance
 
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
engineer who's with me now and he's
 
02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
telling me that these units are uh
 
02:11:19.350 --> 02:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
rooftop mounted units okay uh and they
 
02:11:22.830 --> 02:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
are to address uh uh major spaces within
 
02:11:27.310 --> 02:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
the building thank you yes sir Mr Shay
 
02:11:28.270 --> 02:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
you had a
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
comment yeah just to help the committee
 
02:11:32.669 --> 02:11:32.679 align:start position:0%
out a little bit the numbers that
 
02:11:34.229 --> 02:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
director is referencing are the numbers
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
that came in in June at the governor's
 
02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
capital budget hearings at that time the
 
02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
governor along with the public works and
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
others will pick several projects to put
 
02:11:48.069 --> 02:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
in that um blue book that you have and
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
they end reviewing the numbers or the
 
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
estimates at that time and they they
 
02:11:53.109 --> 02:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
come up with a new estimate so the best
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
number for the estimate is the one
 
02:11:57.069 --> 02:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
that's contained in the blue book is
 
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
which is also the number that's in um
 
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.350 align:start position:0%
which is also the number that's in um
Bill

02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:12:04.189 --> 02:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
25 I was just hopeful that it had been
 
02:12:09.069 --> 02:12:09.079 align:start position:0%
revised again um not that I'm aware of I
 
02:12:10.990 --> 02:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
the numbers high from the Blue Book to
 
02:12:16.109 --> 02:12:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
Edgar uh thank you Mr chairman and and
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
also thank you for taking my question
 
02:12:23.470 --> 02:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a general one in a way U
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
has to do with the filtration system or
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
the ventilation system were there any
 
02:12:29.149 --> 02:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
tests taken which would show that there
 
02:12:32.350 --> 02:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
is a is a problem with uh any any type
 
02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
of violation of air quality standards at
 
02:12:42.510 --> 02:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:47.470 --> 02:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
yes we uh we do periodic uh testing uh
 
02:12:51.270 --> 02:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
to measure uh lead levels uh within that
 
02:12:53.470 --> 02:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
that uh training
 
02:12:56.750 --> 02:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
space uh for those who are probably not
 
02:13:00.109 --> 02:13:00.119 align:start position:0%
familiar with uh the way an indoor range
 
02:13:03.549 --> 02:13:03.559 align:start position:0%
functions uh there is a uh a ventilation
 
02:13:03.559 --> 02:13:04.270 align:start position:0%
functions uh there is a uh a ventilation
or

02:13:04.270 --> 02:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
circulation pattern that is set up
 
02:13:09.390 --> 02:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
through all of these devices so that
 
02:13:12.030 --> 02:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
it's pulling all the air from where the
 
02:13:15.390 --> 02:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
shooters stand and pulling that air down
 
02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
towards the
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
target uh so as to get those toxic uh fu
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
does away from the the officer shooting
 
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
and captured in the ventilation system
 
02:13:30.270 --> 02:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
at the Target end of the range uh to
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
specifically to what those numbers are
 
02:13:34.830 --> 02:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
sir uh I do not have those in front of
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
me but I'm looking at the uh my uh plant
 
02:13:41.109 --> 02:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
maintenance engineer and he is telling
 
02:13:43.790 --> 02:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
me that uh we do collect those numbers
 
02:13:45.549 --> 02:13:45.559 align:start position:0%
and we do have those numbers available
 
02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
if anybody needs to see them if I just
 
02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
do a followup uh follow up yeah yeah I
 
02:13:54.030 --> 02:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessarily wondering what the
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
values were I just wondering if there
 
02:13:58.270 --> 02:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
had been a test taken and if there were
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
violations and that was one of the
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
reasons that you wanted to uh to replace
 
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
the system that's all it's it sounds
 
02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
like your project sounds like a good
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%

03:35:58.790 --> 03:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
ensure our public places are safe
 
03:36:00.870 --> 03:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
accessible and positioned to bolster our
 
03:36:03.389 --> 03:36:03.399 align:start position:0%
economic future through a robust and
 
03:36:05.990 --> 03:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
responsible outdoor recreation economy
 
03:36:07.590 --> 03:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
and a creative economy that is being
 
03:36:09.590 --> 03:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
recognized as a priority in communities
 
03:36:12.070 --> 03:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
large and small I thank you for your
 
03:36:14.030 --> 03:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
time today and I'm joined by members of
 
03:36:16.110 --> 03:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
our agency's leadership team and we are
 
03:36:18.870 --> 03:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
ready to answer your
 
03:36:21.389 --> 03:36:21.399 align:start position:0%
questions commissioner if you could go
 
03:36:24.630 --> 03:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
over each of the product projects that
 
03:36:28.429 --> 03:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
are included in the governor's proposal
 
03:36:30.830 --> 03:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:36:33.309 --> 03:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
we'll consider the
 
03:36:36.070 --> 03:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
Tramway great thank you of course um
 
03:36:38.670 --> 03:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
with me is Tom Mansfield who is more
 
03:36:41.389 --> 03:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
than our department architect um but he
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
has put together some um specific
 
03:36:45.590 --> 03:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
details about each of the project
 
03:36:47.110 --> 03:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
projects that we've outlined and that
 
03:36:48.830 --> 03:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
the governor included in his capital
 
03:36:51.590 --> 03:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
budget so I will turn it over to Tom
 
03:36:54.110 --> 03:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much the governor's
 
03:36:57.110 --> 03:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
budget had four items totaling uh
 
03:37:01.189 --> 03:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
5,233 th000 which includes some federal
 
03:37:03.870 --> 03:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
money which is why that's higher than
 
03:37:06.590 --> 03:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
the 4,000 we told you earlier but the
 
03:37:09.510 --> 03:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
first item on our on our list is radio
 
03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
communications Network replacement for
 
03:37:12.160 --> 03:37:15.550 align:start position:0%
communications Network replacement for
$713,000

03:37:15.550 --> 03:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:18.790 --> 03:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
the uh radio communication system is how
 
03:37:20.389 --> 03:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of our field people communicate
 
03:37:23.389 --> 03:37:23.399 align:start position:0%
with each other it's a an essential
 
03:37:27.150 --> 03:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
system for doing for uh life safety
 
03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
situations that come up like wildfires
 
03:37:33.030 --> 03:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
floods storms it's also essential for
 
03:37:35.229 --> 03:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
our daily operations it's how our Park
 
03:37:37.750 --> 03:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
staff communicate with one another it's
 
03:37:40.990 --> 03:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
how uh Mount madno organizes rescues and
 
03:37:44.110 --> 03:37:44.120 align:start position:0%
how Hampton Beach organizes their
 
03:37:47.630 --> 03:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
lifeguards so an essential service but
 
03:37:50.030 --> 03:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
our system was put in in 1995 and that's
 
03:37:51.670 --> 03:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
pretty old for radio
 
03:37:54.030 --> 03:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
equipment so we can't get replacement
 
03:37:56.550 --> 03:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
parts anymore and it doesn't have the
 
03:37:59.030 --> 03:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
functional operations that new systems
 
03:38:01.790 --> 03:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
have a new system is interoperable that
 
03:38:05.950 --> 03:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
is to say if uh I'm a lifeguard holding
 
03:38:08.790 --> 03:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
a radio right now I have to call a
 
03:38:10.870 --> 03:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
central dispatch and then if they need
 
03:38:12.990 --> 03:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
to talk to the next lifeguard down they
 
03:38:15.710 --> 03:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
can relay my message to him but with an
 
03:38:17.790 --> 03:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
interoperable system I can talk directly
 
03:38:20.189 --> 03:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
to them and if it's interoperable
 
03:38:22.630 --> 03:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
between agencies it means if I'm a park
 
03:38:25.150 --> 03:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
manager and I have a real problem I can
 
03:38:27.389 --> 03:38:27.399 align:start position:0%
go directly to the state police where I
 
03:38:29.750 --> 03:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
can get help from fish and game so
 
03:38:31.070 --> 03:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's what the new system would bring
 
03:38:35.030 --> 03:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
us and we think it's very important to
 
03:38:39.269 --> 03:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
us now in the last bium we made a
 
03:38:43.269 --> 03:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
request for this same uh project and we
 
03:38:46.150 --> 03:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
were asking for uh 89
 
03:38:48.510 --> 03:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
$95,000 for doing the southern half of
 
03:38:50.950 --> 03:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
the state recognized that the radio
 
03:38:52.830 --> 03:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
system is a big cost item and we had
 
03:38:55.189 --> 03:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
split it up in the two phases Southern
 
03:38:58.469 --> 03:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
half and Northern half uh we were only
 
03:38:59.790 --> 03:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
able to get
 
03:39:03.429 --> 03:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
400,000 for this current vium and we
 
03:39:05.550 --> 03:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
haven't spent that money because talking
 
03:39:09.189 --> 03:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
to our radio supplier Motorola there's
 
03:39:11.189 --> 03:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
no good way to peace meal the system it
 
03:39:15.590 --> 03:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
has to be done as a whole upgrade so we
 
03:39:17.990 --> 03:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
to this bium hoping that we could get
 
03:39:20.150 --> 03:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
more funds so that we could complete the
 
03:39:23.030 --> 03:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
system now on our radio system we've
 
03:39:25.349 --> 03:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
been working closely with the Department
 
03:39:27.750 --> 03:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
of Safety they have been helping us out
 
03:39:31.030 --> 03:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
maintain all of our communication sites
 
03:39:33.070 --> 03:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
and it has really been working out very
 
03:39:37.030 --> 03:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
well they looked at our proposal for the
 
03:39:39.389 --> 03:39:39.399 align:start position:0%
southern half of the state with
 
03:39:41.870 --> 03:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
us we asked them to consult with us on
 
03:39:44.510 --> 03:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
it and they came back to us and pointed
 
03:39:46.389 --> 03:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
out that all of our communication sites
 
03:39:47.790 --> 03:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
are sites that they already have
 
03:39:50.309 --> 03:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
equipment at and that their existing
 
03:39:52.750 --> 03:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
equipment in many cases could
 
03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
accommodate what we were hoping to do
 
03:39:57.269 --> 03:39:57.279 align:start position:0%
with a new system so looking at this
 
03:39:59.389 --> 03:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
together we realized that if we be
 
03:40:02.070 --> 03:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
became integrated into their system we
 
03:40:03.550 --> 03:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
could really Save A Lot on
 
03:40:03.560 --> 03:40:04.950 align:start position:0%
could really Save A Lot on
infrastructure

03:40:04.950 --> 03:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
03:40:07.670 --> 03:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
equipment so uh we are coming back to
 
03:40:10.510 --> 03:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
you today with a proposal to replace the
 
03:40:15.349 --> 03:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
entire State system for the $713,000
 
03:40:18.269 --> 03:40:18.279 align:start position:0%
working with the do people their people
 
03:40:20.110 --> 03:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
will do installation and help us with
 
03:40:21.590 --> 03:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance on it which is a great
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
advantage to
 
03:40:25.269 --> 03:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
us and this will give us all the
 
03:40:26.950 --> 03:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
advantages of the new system the
 
03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
interoperability it'll bring us up to uh
 
03:40:33.030 --> 03:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
the current standards other agencies in
 
03:40:36.189 --> 03:40:36.199 align:start position:0%
the state counties local are also trying
 
03:40:38.790 --> 03:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
to integrate into the same system so
 
03:40:40.389 --> 03:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
that in emergencies we can all
 
03:40:40.399 --> 03:40:41.750 align:start position:0%
that in emergencies we can all
communicate

03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
communicate
 
03:40:45.309 --> 03:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
together so uh that's why we think this
 
03:40:47.630 --> 03:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
one is a very important one for us and
 
03:40:50.229 --> 03:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
we're we're really pleased with the uh
 
03:40:52.750 --> 03:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
relationship with do which I think is
 
03:40:53.630 --> 03:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:40:55.830 --> 03:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
be work it's going to work well and it's
 
03:40:58.510 --> 03:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
going to save us all a lot of
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
money I do have a question on this um
 
03:41:05.309 --> 03:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you're working with safety
 
03:41:08.510 --> 03:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
because that's always a good thing um
 
03:41:11.189 --> 03:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
you're asking for
 
03:41:15.590 --> 03:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
73,000 is that in addition to the
 
03:41:18.389 --> 03:41:18.399 align:start position:0%
partial funding you received Last by
 
03:41:20.830 --> 03:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
Anum that's correct we were asking for
 
03:41:23.189 --> 03:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
it to supplement the 400,000 we had
 
03:41:26.110 --> 03:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
asked for before which we're asking for
 
03:41:31.110 --> 03:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:34.469 --> 03:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
you uh shall I move on to the next one
 
03:41:34.479 --> 03:41:37.790 align:start position:0%
you uh shall I move on to the next one
representative

03:41:37.790 --> 03:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:41.189 --> 03:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
Eble thank you Mr chair good to see you
 
03:41:45.469 --> 03:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
folks again it's been a while um so I
 
03:41:47.309 --> 03:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
was just trying to follow the bouncing
 
03:41:49.830 --> 03:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
ball a little bit are you saying that
 
03:41:53.469 --> 03:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
this money is going to replace the the
 
03:41:56.910 --> 03:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
system for the whole state and
 
03:42:00.189 --> 03:42:00.199 align:start position:0%
all agencies are going to benefit from
 
03:42:02.670 --> 03:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
it and it just happens to be in your
 
03:42:05.790 --> 03:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
budget is that the way that works I wish
 
03:42:10.790 --> 03:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
it was okay it's only for uh dncr okay
 
03:42:13.149 --> 03:42:13.159 align:start position:0%
so because previously we had been
 
03:42:14.990 --> 03:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting a two-phase project one for
 
03:42:18.070 --> 03:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
the Southern half of d ncr's uh radio
 
03:42:19.630 --> 03:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
equipment and then for the northern half
 
03:42:21.910 --> 03:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
of the state but we can do the whole
 
03:42:24.670 --> 03:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
state for our equipment under this
 
03:42:28.269 --> 03:42:28.279 align:start position:0%
project okay just follow up Mr chair so
 
03:42:31.309 --> 03:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
but but so is safety also going to be
 
03:42:32.990 --> 03:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
benefiting from the system you're
 
03:42:35.910 --> 03:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
putting in or this really is a whole I
 
03:42:39.349 --> 03:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
was just confused on the
 
03:42:41.349 --> 03:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
interrelationship well safety has been
 
03:42:43.469 --> 03:42:43.479 align:start position:0%
directed to try and consolidate all the
 
03:42:47.110 --> 03:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
state radio communic ations and uh I
 
03:42:49.550 --> 03:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
think we're their first big taker so in
 
03:42:51.670 --> 03:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
that sense it benefits them from getting
 
03:42:53.550 --> 03:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
their program off the ground and we can
 
03:42:55.630 --> 03:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
show how it can be done and demonstrate
 
03:42:57.710 --> 03:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
the benefits it certainly will be a
 
03:42:59.590 --> 03:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
benefit from our point of
 
03:43:03.189 --> 03:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
view okay thank
 
03:43:05.030 --> 03:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
03:43:07.389 --> 03:43:07.399 align:start position:0%
see representative
 
03:43:09.870 --> 03:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
Jack uh thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
03:43:11.950 --> 03:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
you uh for coming it's always lovely to
 
03:43:14.550 --> 03:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
see dncr if I understand this you
 
03:43:16.710 --> 03:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
sharing infrastructure things like maybe
 
03:43:19.590 --> 03:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
the towers and the power feed to the
 
03:43:21.950 --> 03:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
tower but you have your own unique
 
03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
equipment maybe because you're on
 
03:43:24.910 --> 03:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
different frequencies than safety
 
03:43:27.110 --> 03:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
something like that is that a fair
 
03:43:31.510 --> 03:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
characterization of where the Synergy is
 
03:43:34.229 --> 03:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
yes the system uh has repeaters which is
 
03:43:37.309 --> 03:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
equipment which forwards signals and uh
 
03:43:38.910 --> 03:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety has repeaters and
 
03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
we have had repeaters too but as I
 
03:43:43.750 --> 03:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
understand it and do we have Department
 
03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
of Safety also here no oh okay
 
03:43:51.309 --> 03:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
uh their repeaters have enough capacity
 
03:43:53.349 --> 03:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
so that they could handle our traffic on
 
03:43:55.030 --> 03:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
their equipment because when they built
 
03:43:56.870 --> 03:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
their system they intended to
 
03:43:58.429 --> 03:43:58.439 align:start position:0%
consolidate all the different state
 
03:44:00.550 --> 03:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
agencies so they built that extra
 
03:44:02.590 --> 03:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
capacity into the system and they're
 
03:44:06.429 --> 03:44:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:09.870 --> 03:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
it for the for the committee reminder
 
03:44:12.110 --> 03:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
that um Department of Safety
 
03:44:13.990 --> 03:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner Quinn will be on later if
 
03:44:17.269 --> 03:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
you want to ask ask him about this at at
 
03:44:26.229 --> 03:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:28.229 --> 03:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
presentation shall I go ahead with the
 
03:44:30.790 --> 03:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
other items uh representative cluder
 
03:44:33.830 --> 03:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman a question
 
03:44:35.870 --> 03:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
now is this I noticed in the Blue Book
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
you only had a there was only
 
03:44:41.030 --> 03:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
appropriated 545,000 but the governor
 
03:44:42.870 --> 03:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
gave you a little more
 
03:44:45.750 --> 03:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
73,000 I was curious why it discrepancy
 
03:44:47.990 --> 03:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
and you think uh this is going to be
 
03:44:49.830 --> 03:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
enough on top of the
 
03:44:51.950 --> 03:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
$400,000 we appropriated in the last
 
03:44:51.960 --> 03:44:53.309 align:start position:0%
$400,000 we appropriated in the last
capital

03:44:53.309 --> 03:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
capital
 
03:44:58.510 --> 03:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
budget yes I can explain that uh the the
 
03:45:02.750 --> 03:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
455 was because that was our original
 
03:45:04.429 --> 03:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
request for the southern half of the
 
03:45:06.950 --> 03:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
state to do it on our own without help
 
03:45:09.469 --> 03:45:09.479 align:start position:0%
from Department of Safety okay so once
 
03:45:10.750 --> 03:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
we realized we could do it with the
 
03:45:13.349 --> 03:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety we realized we
 
03:45:14.990 --> 03:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
could do the whole state but we would
 
03:45:16.389 --> 03:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
would need an additional
 
03:45:19.309 --> 03:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
713 to do the whole state and not just
 
03:45:20.990 --> 03:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
the southern half of the
 
03:45:23.349 --> 03:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
state okay thank you very much for that
 
03:45:25.710 --> 03:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you Mr chairman
 
03:45:25.720 --> 03:45:32.269 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you Mr chairman
representative

03:45:32.269 --> 03:45:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:39.429 --> 03:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:42.910 --> 03:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
Denis that's better Tom is this system
 
03:45:44.590 --> 03:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
going to help with the emergency command
 
03:45:47.149 --> 03:45:47.159 align:start position:0%
center in the case of you know a
 
03:45:49.870 --> 03:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
hurricane or whatever is that going to
 
03:45:51.309 --> 03:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
widen your
 
03:45:54.950 --> 03:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
communication yes uh and
 
03:45:57.469 --> 03:45:57.479 align:start position:0%
that the department of safety has
 
03:45:59.910 --> 03:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
consoles all around the state which we
 
03:46:01.990 --> 03:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
would be able to use if we needed to set
 
03:46:04.710 --> 03:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
up quickly and they also have uh
 
03:46:07.389 --> 03:46:07.399 align:start position:0%
essentially portable consoles so that if
 
03:46:09.910 --> 03:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
we had a situation like a wild fire we
 
03:46:11.790 --> 03:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
could bring that right to the site and
 
03:46:14.550 --> 03:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
have the main dispatch working from that
 
03:46:14.560 --> 03:46:15.750 align:start position:0%
have the main dispatch working from that
site

03:46:15.750 --> 03:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
site
 
03:46:17.269 --> 03:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the advantages of the
 
03:46:17.279 --> 03:46:19.429 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the advantages of the
new

03:46:19.429 --> 03:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
new
 
03:46:22.510 --> 03:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
system okay thank
 
03:46:24.870 --> 03:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
you um it I just learned that the
 
03:46:27.790 --> 03:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
department of safety has staff available
 
03:46:31.950 --> 03:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:47.110 --> 03:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:51.990 --> 03:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:54.349 --> 03:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
them good afternoon uh members of the
 
03:46:57.790 --> 03:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
committee can you can you hear us yes
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
hello uh I'm Sean Goodwin and this is uh
 
03:47:03.750 --> 03:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
Josh man uh from the Department of
 
03:47:07.110 --> 03:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
Safety Communications uh section where
 
03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
we are currently at the track in our
 
03:47:12.189 --> 03:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
Command Post uh getting ready to support
 
03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
the uh super vax uh event and um
 
03:47:17.750 --> 03:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
everything that you heard from Tom
 
03:47:20.469 --> 03:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
Mansfield and the commissioner is is
 
03:47:23.670 --> 03:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
accurate um essentially all of the
 
03:47:26.590 --> 03:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
dollars that are being requested go into
 
03:47:29.550 --> 03:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
the physical radio resources that the
 
03:47:32.469 --> 03:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
NCR needs to upgrade to support all
 
03:47:34.670 --> 03:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
their different operations whether it be
 
03:47:37.910 --> 03:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
at Canon Mount Washington uh the
 
03:47:40.950 --> 03:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
Southwest the forest uh the forest fire
 
03:47:44.429 --> 03:47:44.439 align:start position:0%
towers and without having to spend uh
 
03:47:46.710 --> 03:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
money on duplicating things that the
 
03:47:48.349 --> 03:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
department of safety's core
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:01.110 --> 03:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:03.550 --> 03:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
clarification seeing no further
 
03:48:07.030 --> 03:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
questions moving on to Mount
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
Washington all right our our second
 
03:48:12.510 --> 03:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
priority was upgrading the water system
 
03:48:14.070 --> 03:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
on the summit of Mount Washington which
 
03:48:16.269 --> 03:48:16.279 align:start position:0%
supplies our Sherman Adams Visitor
 
03:48:19.469 --> 03:48:19.479 align:start position:0%
Center that uh the water tanks up there
 
03:48:21.349 --> 03:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
actually predate the Sherman Adams
 
03:48:24.510 --> 03:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
Building they were put in 1969 their
 
03:48:26.030 --> 03:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
steel tanks and they're beginning to
 
03:48:28.790 --> 03:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
rust out and because they were put in
 
03:48:31.189 --> 03:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
before the Sherman Adams Building they
 
03:48:33.349 --> 03:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
they weren't set up to operate
 
03:48:35.149 --> 03:48:35.159 align:start position:0%
efficiently with a new system in fact
 
03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
their tanks are located some 320 ft down
 
03:48:40.910 --> 03:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
slope from the building so we have a
 
03:48:43.630 --> 03:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
situation where our new well that went
 
03:48:45.710 --> 03:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
in with the building which is right next
 
03:48:47.469 --> 03:48:47.479 align:start position:0%
to the building pumps the water downhill
 
03:48:49.550 --> 03:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
to the tanks and then we have to pump
 
03:48:51.510 --> 03:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
back up the hill to the tanks to the
 
03:48:54.070 --> 03:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
building and this works well enough in
 
03:48:57.630 --> 03:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
the in the summer but those 320 fet are
 
03:48:59.590 --> 03:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh open to freezing during the winter
 
03:49:01.510 --> 03:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
and we keep that building operating all
 
03:49:04.269 --> 03:49:04.279 align:start position:0%
winter long we have Observatory
 
03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
Washington Observatory staff there and
 
03:49:09.110 --> 03:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
we have Park staff and occasionally The
 
03:49:12.469 --> 03:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
Observatory has Eco trips that uh bring
 
03:49:15.110 --> 03:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
in a dozen people overnight so we have
 
03:49:17.189 --> 03:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
water needs right through the winter and
 
03:49:18.630 --> 03:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
in order to keep the building running
 
03:49:20.469 --> 03:49:20.479 align:start position:0%
right now we have to shut down the
 
03:49:23.229 --> 03:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
summer season water system drain it out
 
03:49:27.110 --> 03:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
and set up the new season uh system uh
 
03:49:29.229 --> 03:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
every year so that's a lot of extra
 
03:49:31.710 --> 03:49:31.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance so where we're at a point
 
03:49:33.670 --> 03:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
where we need to replace main components
 
03:49:35.870 --> 03:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
of the water system now we wanted to
 
03:49:38.110 --> 03:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
take this opportunity to really improve
 
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
the system and working with Underwood
 
03:49:43.269 --> 03:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
Engineers we've come up with a plan to
 
03:49:45.349 --> 03:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
put new water tanks which are made out
 
03:49:47.429 --> 03:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
of fiberglass reinforced plastic so they
 
03:49:50.229 --> 03:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
won't rust like the current steel tanks
 
03:49:52.670 --> 03:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
we would locate them uh right adjacent
 
03:49:55.229 --> 03:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
to the Sherman Adams Building dug into
 
03:49:58.349 --> 03:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
the fill behind the building towards the
 
03:50:00.030 --> 03:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh Summit side of the building if you're
 
03:50:02.349 --> 03:50:02.359 align:start position:0%
familiar with the site at all so those
 
03:50:03.910 --> 03:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
tanks would be underground behind the
 
03:50:06.429 --> 03:50:06.439 align:start position:0%
building but right adjacent to it our
 
03:50:08.309 --> 03:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
new system could pump right from the
 
03:50:10.189 --> 03:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
well into the building root the water
 
03:50:12.670 --> 03:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
pipes through the building to these two
 
03:50:15.790 --> 03:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
new 20,000g tanks one of which would be
 
03:50:19.389 --> 03:50:19.399 align:start position:0%
set up with a heater and a agitator to
 
03:50:21.030 --> 03:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
keep the water moving so it won't freeze
 
03:50:23.269 --> 03:50:23.279 align:start position:0%
in the winter time so we would have the
 
03:50:25.910 --> 03:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
same water system running winter and
 
03:50:28.110 --> 03:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
summer and uh that would be a great
 
03:50:30.149 --> 03:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
convenience to us and we don't have to
 
03:50:32.309 --> 03:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
go through all the testing for a public
 
03:50:35.510 --> 03:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
water system every time we change over
 
03:50:38.670 --> 03:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
uh so it's highly desirable for us to
 
03:50:41.110 --> 03:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
get this accomplished uh we thought that
 
03:50:43.590 --> 03:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
that would be well our current ask is
 
03:50:45.269 --> 03:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
for a million 120,000
 
03:50:47.990 --> 03:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
for it there's quite a bit of site work
 
03:50:49.950 --> 03:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
and any piece of work on the summit of
 
03:50:52.750 --> 03:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington is complicated and
 
03:50:56.670 --> 03:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
expensive as you may know from previous
 
03:50:59.269 --> 03:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
requests uh could I answer any questions
 
03:51:01.630 --> 03:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
on that
 
03:51:05.429 --> 03:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
one see no
 
03:51:07.950 --> 03:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
questions all right our number three
 
03:51:10.469 --> 03:51:10.479 align:start position:0%
request is for roofing and
 
03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
repairs uh this is a group of uh
 
03:51:15.429 --> 03:51:15.439 align:start position:0%
projects that we're requesting money for
 
03:51:18.510 --> 03:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
roofing repairs and deferred maintenance
 
03:51:20.189 --> 03:51:20.199 align:start position:0%
required to keep our state parks open
 
03:51:23.030 --> 03:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
and other state parks and other D NCR
 
03:51:25.070 --> 03:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
facilities operating and providing
 
03:51:27.309 --> 03:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
Services it's a source of funding to
 
03:51:29.070 --> 03:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
allow the department to respond to
 
03:51:31.790 --> 03:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
critical facility failures things like
 
03:51:34.189 --> 03:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
water and septic pump failures boiler
 
03:51:37.950 --> 03:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
failures storm damage one year we had a
 
03:51:39.750 --> 03:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
a big storm in April that tore up the
 
03:51:43.030 --> 03:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
parking lot in Northampton State Beach
 
03:51:44.710 --> 03:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh we were able to get that repaired
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
because we had money right there we
 
03:51:48.389 --> 03:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
could move quickly and get that parking
 
03:51:51.550 --> 03:51:51.560 align:start position:0%
lot repaved in time to open for Memorial
 
03:51:56.070 --> 03:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
Day so it's quite important to us uh
 
03:51:58.990 --> 03:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
there's a attached in the packet there's
 
03:52:01.830 --> 03:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
a list of repairs and there's a list of
 
03:52:05.189 --> 03:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
roofing projects uh the repairs are
 
03:52:06.750 --> 03:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
representative of the types of projects
 
03:52:08.990 --> 03:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to address with this
 
03:52:11.189 --> 03:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
funding but we know that since we're
 
03:52:14.269 --> 03:52:14.279 align:start position:0%
dealing largely with uh situations that
 
03:52:16.910 --> 03:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
come up up during the season uh there on
 
03:52:19.309 --> 03:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
the emergency basis the list is going to
 
03:52:20.950 --> 03:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
be subject to substitutions and
 
03:52:23.830 --> 03:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
revisions in order to accommodate that
 
03:52:25.590 --> 03:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh that flexibility is greatly important
 
03:52:29.630 --> 03:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
to us so uh this year in
 
03:52:32.110 --> 03:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
Roofing there's about
 
03:52:34.990 --> 03:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
$340,000 worth of roofing projects we've
 
03:52:37.590 --> 03:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
identified and uh I'm pleased to report
 
03:52:39.229 --> 03:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
that we are coming to the end of our
 
03:52:41.710 --> 03:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance un Roofing the
 
03:52:44.070 --> 03:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
state parks is somewhere in the vicinity
 
03:52:47.870 --> 03:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
of 8 65 buildings A lot of them are very
 
03:52:49.269 --> 03:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
small buildings
 
03:52:51.910 --> 03:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
admittedly uh but when we started this
 
03:52:54.590 --> 03:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
program of roofing and repairs which I
 
03:52:56.990 --> 03:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
think was in about
 
03:53:01.189 --> 03:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
2026 uh we were hopelessly behind in our
 
03:53:04.510 --> 03:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
Roofing and now with this appropriation
 
03:53:06.269 --> 03:53:06.279 align:start position:0%
over the years we've been able to
 
03:53:08.630 --> 03:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
whittle that list down so that as we go
 
03:53:12.229 --> 03:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
forward it'll be a all scheduled
 
03:53:14.630 --> 03:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
maintenance in other words we know that
 
03:53:16.830 --> 03:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
every two years we'll have so many roofs
 
03:53:19.309 --> 03:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
come up that are due to be repaired and
 
03:53:20.710 --> 03:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
that should be a manageable amount that
 
03:53:23.429 --> 03:53:23.439 align:start position:0%
we can continue into the future so this
 
03:53:32.590 --> 03:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:40.189 --> 03:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:47.790 --> 03:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:51.349 --> 03:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
yes just follow up on what what your
 
03:53:54.830 --> 03:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
explanation was I'm assuming that these
 
03:53:56.950 --> 03:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
projects will be
 
03:54:00.070 --> 03:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
prioritized based on me is that correct
 
03:54:00.080 --> 03:54:02.349 align:start position:0%
prioritized based on me is that correct
that's

03:54:02.349 --> 03:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:54:05.630 --> 03:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
correct and we recognize that uh
 
03:54:07.110 --> 03:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes those priorities shift in the
 
03:54:10.229 --> 03:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
course of a bium as different situations
 
03:54:11.990 --> 03:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
develop and things we have to respond to
 
03:54:12.000 --> 03:54:19.229 align:start position:0%
develop and things we have to respond to
change

03:54:19.229 --> 03:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:22.950 --> 03:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:26.070 --> 03:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
questions next
 
03:54:28.590 --> 03:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
is toilet
 
03:54:30.950 --> 03:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
building our fourth item was a request
 
03:54:34.309 --> 03:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
for uh continuing support in our ongoing
 
03:54:36.229 --> 03:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
program for toilet building
 
03:54:40.189 --> 03:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
upgrades we have uh just about 85 toilet
 
03:54:42.510 --> 03:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
buildings or bath houses in the state
 
03:54:45.070 --> 03:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
parks and other state reservations
 
03:54:47.030 --> 03:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
and uh many of these buildings have had
 
03:54:49.630 --> 03:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
long hard service it leaves them
 
03:54:51.469 --> 03:54:51.479 align:start position:0%
difficult to maintain and hard to keep
 
03:54:54.670 --> 03:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
clean and we know from reports we get on
 
03:54:56.189 --> 03:54:56.199 align:start position:0%
questionnaires that we ask of our
 
03:54:58.349 --> 03:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
patrons that the quality and conditions
 
03:55:00.030 --> 03:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
of our toilet facilities have a major
 
03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
effect on whether our visitors have a
 
03:55:03.469 --> 03:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
good experience in the state parks and
 
03:55:05.309 --> 03:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
whether they're interested in coming
 
03:55:09.750 --> 03:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
back so uh we have been working on
 
03:55:11.830 --> 03:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
replacing any of our facilities or
 
03:55:13.469 --> 03:55:13.479 align:start position:0%
renovating any of our facilities that
 
03:55:15.469 --> 03:55:15.479 align:start position:0%
don't live up to to our state park
 
03:55:20.309 --> 03:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
standards in this panium we had uh four
 
03:55:22.110 --> 03:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
uh toilet buildings that we hope to
 
03:55:24.269 --> 03:55:24.279 align:start position:0%
address and the first one was a
 
03:55:26.750 --> 03:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
renovation of the of the toilet building
 
03:55:29.590 --> 03:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
at the south end of Hampton Beach we did
 
03:55:31.309 --> 03:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
the exterior of this building several
 
03:55:33.149 --> 03:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
years back when we were doing other work
 
03:55:36.389 --> 03:55:36.399 align:start position:0%
at Hampton Beach but the interior is in
 
03:55:40.269 --> 03:55:40.279 align:start position:0%
a pretty rough shape at this point uh
 
03:55:42.830 --> 03:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
right now it includes a lot of shower
 
03:55:45.149 --> 03:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
rooms and what we've realized is that
 
03:55:46.870 --> 03:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
for showers on the beach what people
 
03:55:48.550 --> 03:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
really like and what works best is
 
03:55:51.389 --> 03:55:51.399 align:start position:0%
exterior shower pole facilities so that
 
03:55:52.990 --> 03:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have to have interior shower
 
03:55:56.070 --> 03:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
rooms which are difficult to keep clean
 
03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
and hard to maintain so we can do much
 
03:56:00.910 --> 03:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
better uh with the interior building we
 
03:56:03.309 --> 03:56:03.319 align:start position:0%
can provide more toilets and we can move
 
03:56:06.070 --> 03:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
the shower poles outside so that would
 
03:56:08.670 --> 03:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
be a great Improvement at Hampton South
 
03:56:12.110 --> 03:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
Beach then in our campgrounds we had uh
 
03:56:13.750 --> 03:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
two toilet buildings which we want to
 
03:56:18.389 --> 03:56:18.399 align:start position:0%
renovate and add on to so in Pak uh it's
 
03:56:20.030 --> 03:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
toilet building number two which is in
 
03:56:22.550 --> 03:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
the Neils Cove area if you are familiar
 
03:56:25.189 --> 03:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
with pakway uh these are buildings which
 
03:56:28.510 --> 03:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
date back to the 70s uh we will renovate
 
03:56:33.309 --> 03:56:33.319 align:start position:0%
the existing toilet areas add on showers
 
03:56:36.349 --> 03:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
stalls uh what we call Family bathrooms
 
03:56:38.590 --> 03:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
that's private bathroom with a sink and
 
03:56:41.870 --> 03:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
a toilet in it and uh pot washing sinks
 
03:56:43.070 --> 03:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
for our
 
03:56:45.469 --> 03:56:45.479 align:start position:0%
campers uh we'll do a similar thing in
 
03:56:48.149 --> 03:56:48.159 align:start position:0%
White Lake toilet building also toilet
 
03:56:50.229 --> 03:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
building number two in White Lake which
 
03:56:53.429 --> 03:56:53.439 align:start position:0%
is in the area one Campground so both of
 
03:56:54.830 --> 03:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
these buildings would be a combination
 
03:56:56.469 --> 03:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
of renovation and
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
addition and then the fourth building
 
03:57:01.670 --> 03:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
was the uh toilet building number three
 
03:57:04.030 --> 03:57:04.040 align:start position:0%
which is on the south side of Lafayette
 
03:57:06.550 --> 03:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
campground at Lafayette We have replaced
 
03:57:08.590 --> 03:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of toilet facilities but this is
 
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
the one building that goes back to the
 
03:57:14.630 --> 03:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
1950s it's uh pretty rudimentary and and
 
03:57:17.990 --> 03:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh well-loved but hard to keep up and is
 
03:57:20.790 --> 03:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
not really living up to our camper hopes
 
03:57:23.349 --> 03:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
these days so we would propose replacing
 
03:57:25.830 --> 03:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
that building all
 
03:57:27.910 --> 03:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
together and that's the four toilet
 
03:57:29.309 --> 03:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
building upgrades that we had hoped to
 
03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
do can I answer any questions on
 
03:57:36.389 --> 03:57:36.399 align:start position:0%
that representative Jack yeah thank you
 
03:57:39.710 --> 03:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
again Mr chairman uh the fact that these
 
03:57:42.429 --> 03:57:42.439 align:start position:0%
are listed with very general things like
 
03:57:45.070 --> 03:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
toilet building repair or roof
 
03:57:47.750 --> 03:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
means that you can spend the money on
 
03:57:49.590 --> 03:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
whatever projects you want within the
 
03:57:51.229 --> 03:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
limits of the money you have and you're
 
03:57:53.630 --> 03:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
and this is sort of informational that
 
03:57:55.750 --> 03:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
you're giving us what you'd like to work
 
03:58:00.469 --> 03:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
on is that right that's correct so uh
 
03:58:01.990 --> 03:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
these are certainly the priorities that
 
03:58:05.309 --> 03:58:05.319 align:start position:0%
we want to address but sometimes uh we
 
03:58:07.229 --> 03:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
might get stopped on one toilet building
 
03:58:09.550 --> 03:58:09.560 align:start position:0%
or another one there could be a problem
 
03:58:12.309 --> 03:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
that comes up and this would allow us to
 
03:58:15.030 --> 03:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
continue in the same category but uh
 
03:58:16.750 --> 03:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
move on to another building until we can
 
03:58:18.870 --> 03:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
resolve whatever the hold up on the
 
03:58:23.269 --> 03:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
previous one for example at uh at wissow
 
03:58:26.790 --> 03:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
we had have in this bium a request for
 
03:58:30.070 --> 03:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh redoing that toilet building there
 
03:58:32.229 --> 03:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
what we've realized is uh our water
 
03:58:34.830 --> 03:58:34.840 align:start position:0%
supply is is not good enough we're
 
03:58:36.510 --> 03:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
waiting to drill a new well to see
 
03:58:38.950 --> 03:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
whether we can get a water supply uh if
 
03:58:40.990 --> 03:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
we can we'll go forward if not we'll try
 
03:58:43.149 --> 03:58:43.159 align:start position:0%
and use the funds in the other toilet
 
03:58:49.030 --> 03:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:53.349 --> 03:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
any representative eel yes thank you um
 
03:58:56.189 --> 03:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
so the this looks like it's a 5050 match
 
03:58:57.469 --> 03:58:57.479 align:start position:0%
with fed
 
03:59:00.229 --> 03:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
funds is that we've been reading a lot
 
03:59:00.239 --> 03:59:01.149 align:start position:0%
funds is that we've been reading a lot
about

03:59:01.149 --> 03:59:01.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:59:04.990 --> 03:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
lwcf is is that the funding or and
 
03:59:07.830 --> 03:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
what's going on with all of that that's
 
03:59:10.030 --> 03:59:10.040 align:start position:0%
exactly the funding uh the commissioner
 
03:59:11.790 --> 03:59:11.800 align:start position:0%
may be more up to date than I am with
 
03:59:14.630 --> 03:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
the current state of lwcf funding
 
03:59:16.309 --> 03:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
but that's the funding that we can get a
 
03:59:19.030 --> 03:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
50-50 match for on projects like this
 
03:59:20.910 --> 03:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
which allows us to extend our Capital
 
03:59:23.269 --> 03:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
dollars quite a bit yeah and you
 
03:59:25.990 --> 03:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
probably have seen a lot of recent news
 
03:59:30.429 --> 03:59:30.439 align:start position:0%
about um some changes made to the lwcf
 
03:59:33.990 --> 03:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
fund um the previous administration made
 
03:59:36.469 --> 03:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
a few changes and it was sort of
 
03:59:39.910 --> 03:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
revealed to the public um in January as
 
03:59:42.670 --> 03:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
soon as we we all of the states notice
 
03:59:44.469 --> 03:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
these changes
 
03:59:47.349 --> 03:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
we asked our Governors and our um our
 
03:59:49.750 --> 03:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
federal delegation to to please help us
 
03:59:52.349 --> 03:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
reverse the changes to go back to how
 
03:59:55.469 --> 03:59:55.479 align:start position:0%
we've always operated under lwcf and
 
03:59:57.990 --> 03:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
that was successful so we are back to
 
04:00:00.670 --> 04:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
how it's always been run and we feel
 
04:00:03.229 --> 04:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
very confident that those funds are
 
04:00:05.110 --> 04:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
readily available and that we can use
 
04:00:06.990 --> 04:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
them in this
 
04:00:10.830 --> 04:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
way follow up Mr chair follow up okay
 
04:00:13.070 --> 04:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um I was really glad
 
04:00:15.630 --> 04:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
to see that that uh reverted back to the
 
04:00:18.550 --> 04:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
way it once was since you went ahead and
 
04:00:21.510 --> 04:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned W Winslow were you saying that
 
04:00:24.469 --> 04:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
if you can't get adequate water you're
 
04:00:27.510 --> 04:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
not going to follow up on the toilet
 
04:00:29.429 --> 04:00:29.439 align:start position:0%
building or I didn't quite follow what
 
04:00:31.590 --> 04:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
you meant there I would never dare
 
04:00:33.429 --> 04:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
suggest such a
 
04:00:36.550 --> 04:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
thing we we will look into composting
 
04:00:38.269 --> 04:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
toilets if that's the
 
04:00:41.269 --> 04:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
case I see well I know a lot of people
 
04:00:42.670 --> 04:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
that would like to have the toilet
 
04:00:46.550 --> 04:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
building follow up that's why follow up
 
04:00:49.870 --> 04:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um commissioner just just a
 
04:00:53.750 --> 04:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
point um you handed out the the slides
 
04:00:56.149 --> 04:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
and it says toilet bowl building
 
04:00:59.630 --> 04:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
upgrades for 2.3 billion I know it's
 
04:01:01.830 --> 04:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
only half that but when somebody just
 
04:01:04.710 --> 04:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
picks up a piece of paper they think
 
04:01:06.830 --> 04:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's the whole thing I I would just
 
04:01:09.429 --> 04:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
break it out on all of your slides
 
04:01:12.750 --> 04:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
between the two sources of of funding so
 
04:01:15.990 --> 04:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
that people actually know what we're
 
04:01:24.830 --> 04:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:28.189 --> 04:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
will any further questions on what the
 
04:01:30.469 --> 04:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
governor has proposed and we've been
 
04:01:30.479 --> 04:01:33.309 align:start position:0%
governor has proposed and we've been
talking

04:01:33.309 --> 04:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:37.110 --> 04:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
about if not represent representative
 
04:01:39.630 --> 04:01:39.640 align:start position:0%
eel all right well I don't comply
 
04:01:41.189 --> 04:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
actually with your request because it's
 
04:01:43.149 --> 04:01:43.159 align:start position:0%
not in the governor's budget but with
 
04:01:44.429 --> 04:01:44.439 align:start position:0%
your for
 
04:01:49.030 --> 04:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
ER I just like to ask lwcf money could
 
04:01:52.030 --> 04:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
be used for the Canon Mountain upgrades
 
04:01:54.229 --> 04:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
at some point or doesn't it fall within
 
04:01:57.349 --> 04:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:00.910 --> 04:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
category um we're we're going to talk
 
04:02:05.070 --> 04:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
about Canon mountain now um and maybe
 
04:02:07.510 --> 04:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
they can answer that question as they go
 
04:02:10.149 --> 04:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
through that um but looking at the
 
04:02:12.389 --> 04:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
dollar amount on Canon You've Got A Hard
 
04:02:12.399 --> 04:02:14.030 align:start position:0%
dollar amount on Canon You've Got A Hard
Sell

04:02:14.030 --> 04:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
Sell
 
04:02:17.189 --> 04:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
yes um I recognize that um uh
 
04:02:19.189 --> 04:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative evil the short answer to
 
04:02:23.349 --> 04:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
your question is yes um lwcf funds could
 
04:02:26.790 --> 04:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
um work to support this effort um the
 
04:02:29.189 --> 04:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
reason I felt compelled to bring this
 
04:02:32.510 --> 04:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
before you today is because I wanted to
 
04:02:35.630 --> 04:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
give a heads up about the future needs
 
04:02:41.790 --> 04:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
at um the Canon Tramway um I I'm not
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
expecting um a magic wand today to fix
 
04:02:48.710 --> 04:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
the Tramway um but I feel like this
 
04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be something that is just
 
04:02:54.870 --> 04:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
sprung upon you um with with a a rushed
 
04:02:58.670 --> 04:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
need so I wanted to make sure that this
 
04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
committee was well aware that we are
 
04:03:03.830 --> 04:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
starting to do our research and come up
 
04:03:06.030 --> 04:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
with a plan and a
 
04:03:08.510 --> 04:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
proposal so that our state can figure
 
04:03:10.710 --> 04:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
out how to move forward and support the
 
04:03:13.990 --> 04:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
Canon Tramway um and so that's really I
 
04:03:15.750 --> 04:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to put it um in front of you
 
04:03:18.149 --> 04:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
today I'm sort of taking advantage of of
 
04:03:21.429 --> 04:03:21.439 align:start position:0%
your of your audience right now um to
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that that you have time to
 
04:03:26.030 --> 04:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
think about this that we have time to
 
04:03:28.149 --> 04:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
answer your questions and that we can
 
04:03:30.469 --> 04:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
think creatively about how we can
 
04:03:32.870 --> 04:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
sustain such an iconic piece of New
 
04:03:36.389 --> 04:03:36.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire moving forward so um so that's
 
04:03:38.309 --> 04:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
why I put it in front of you
 
04:03:43.149 --> 04:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
today okay let's um go ahead and go
 
04:03:46.630 --> 04:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
through it briefly um and I'm sure that
 
04:03:48.790 --> 04:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
there may be some
 
04:03:52.469 --> 04:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
questions great I'll turn it to you Tom
 
04:03:57.030 --> 04:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
yes the uh existing Canon Tramway was
 
04:04:00.349 --> 04:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
installed in 1978 or 80 we're coming up
 
04:04:03.870 --> 04:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
on 40 years and we had a one of our
 
04:04:05.429 --> 04:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
regular series of inspections that's
 
04:04:07.429 --> 04:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
done by the manufacturer on a on a
 
04:04:09.189 --> 04:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
schedule where they checked the
 
04:04:10.950 --> 04:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
condition of the Tramway in
 
04:04:13.189 --> 04:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
2018 and they advised us that it was
 
04:04:15.550 --> 04:04:15.560 align:start position:0%
time to start planning for the
 
04:04:17.269 --> 04:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
replacement of the
 
04:04:21.189 --> 04:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
Tramway um it just at 40 years we're
 
04:04:25.349 --> 04:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
sort of at the lifetime of it one of the
 
04:04:27.189 --> 04:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
most significant problems is the
 
04:04:30.750 --> 04:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
electronic controls being a 1978 vintage
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
they are controlled by floppy discs we
 
04:04:35.149 --> 04:04:35.159 align:start position:0%
can't get any replacement for these
 
04:04:37.269 --> 04:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
controls if they should
 
04:04:40.950 --> 04:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
fail so the way the Tramway works is
 
04:04:43.710 --> 04:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
that the uh the controls the brake
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
Hydraulics the carriages the hangers are
 
04:04:51.469 --> 04:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
all part of an integrated system so the
 
04:04:54.309 --> 04:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
guts of the tram that actually moving
 
04:04:55.990 --> 04:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation tram all need to be
 
04:04:57.469 --> 04:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
replaced as one
 
04:05:00.830 --> 04:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
unit uh our current estimate for what
 
04:05:02.469 --> 04:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
that would cost if we were to do that
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
now would be in the $6.5 million range
 
04:05:10.030 --> 04:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
so that has to do with motor drive brake
 
04:05:12.870 --> 04:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
Hydraulics it's the tram cars and their
 
04:05:14.309 --> 04:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
hanger arms
 
04:05:16.469 --> 04:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
it's the carriages that run on the on
 
04:05:18.950 --> 04:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
the cables the gear
 
04:05:23.349 --> 04:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
boxes uh all the equipment for tracking
 
04:05:26.229 --> 04:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
the ropes uh the hall ropes the bull
 
04:05:29.110 --> 04:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
wheels and the labor that goes into it
 
04:05:31.710 --> 04:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
so it is a big package and that much
 
04:05:33.309 --> 04:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
it's going to be hard for us to break
 
04:05:36.309 --> 04:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
that down into phases I think if if we
 
04:05:37.710 --> 04:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
get to the point where we can do this
 
04:05:40.030 --> 04:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
replacement we would want to plan to do
 
04:05:42.469 --> 04:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
that as one
 
04:05:46.750 --> 04:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
unit uh other items that would go along
 
04:05:50.070 --> 04:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
with a big overhaul of the Tramway would
 
04:05:53.110 --> 04:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
include painting of the exterior steel
 
04:05:55.950 --> 04:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
work in the Tramway Bays if you're
 
04:05:58.590 --> 04:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with the Tramway the the bays
 
04:06:01.389 --> 04:06:01.399 align:start position:0%
are 40 feet high steel structures open
 
04:06:03.910 --> 04:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
where the tram cars go in and out the
 
04:06:05.950 --> 04:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
steel in these things has rusted out
 
04:06:08.349 --> 04:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
very much like a a Steel Bridge would
 
04:06:12.309 --> 04:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
rust and uh we would we need to grind
 
04:06:14.309 --> 04:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
down the rust on that and get it
 
04:06:17.750 --> 04:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
repainted we actually went out to bid uh
 
04:06:20.229 --> 04:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
to get that painting done not being
 
04:06:22.950 --> 04:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
aware of how complicated to process this
 
04:06:26.309 --> 04:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
was uh we had a budget of 250,000 and
 
04:06:28.590 --> 04:06:28.600 align:start position:0%
our low bid was $1.8
 
04:06:33.110 --> 04:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
Million so uh that that bid was high
 
04:06:35.469 --> 04:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
because we had asked them to allow us to
 
04:06:37.389 --> 04:06:37.399 align:start position:0%
continue operations while they were
 
04:06:39.269 --> 04:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
painting I think maybe we would
 
04:06:42.070 --> 04:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
reconsider that in another time out but
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
it is a big number to get that steel
 
04:06:47.469 --> 04:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
work in good shape then we have the the
 
04:06:49.389 --> 04:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
Tramway Towers there three towers that
 
04:06:52.670 --> 04:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
support the cables up the mountain uh
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
the towers uh we have inspected visually
 
04:06:56.590 --> 04:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
and they're actually in pretty good
 
04:06:59.790 --> 04:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
shape but we need to after 40 years we
 
04:07:01.229 --> 04:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
need to have structural engineer
 
04:07:03.630 --> 04:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
actually go up check the Fasteners make
 
04:07:06.309 --> 04:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
sure the steel isn't compromised we know
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
that there's some uh minor work to be
 
04:07:10.469 --> 04:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
done on the foundations with the
 
04:07:13.269 --> 04:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
regrouting uh so that's an item and then
 
04:07:15.309 --> 04:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
of course of course we have The Lodges
 
04:07:17.550 --> 04:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
we have the The Lodge at the base the
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
base station and the mountain station
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
and those were all the same vintage uh
 
04:07:25.550 --> 04:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
well one at the bottom is actually older
 
04:07:28.510 --> 04:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
but uh they were last they had major
 
04:07:30.670 --> 04:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
work last done in the 80s and they're
 
04:07:33.469 --> 04:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
really showing their age and their wear
 
04:07:35.790 --> 04:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
the exterior of the building needs to be
 
04:07:38.109 --> 04:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
sealed up that's the siding and the
 
04:07:40.429 --> 04:07:40.439 align:start position:0%
windows and the mountain station we have
 
04:07:43.269 --> 04:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
the roofing that needs to be done we
 
04:07:45.750 --> 04:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
need a new sprinkler system in the base
 
04:07:48.429 --> 04:07:48.439 align:start position:0%
Lodge and there are just interior
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
renovations to to make our new Tramway
 
04:07:54.030 --> 04:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
system look like a new system and not
 
04:07:56.109 --> 04:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
like one that's 40 years old all the
 
04:07:59.229 --> 04:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
interior finishes carpeting ceilings
 
04:08:01.950 --> 04:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
lighting all that sort of stuff for
 
04:08:04.429 --> 04:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
which we put in an allowance of 500,000
 
04:08:07.349 --> 04:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
for each one of the of The Lodges that
 
04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
brings us up to a total of uh
 
04:08:13.229 --> 04:08:13.239 align:start position:0%
12,225 as our current working estimate
 
04:08:15.269 --> 04:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
and as we we know that's a big number
 
04:08:19.070 --> 04:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
and uh we're working on it uh we could
 
04:08:21.109 --> 04:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
do the base station Renovations a
 
04:08:21.119 --> 04:08:22.229 align:start position:0%
do the base station Renovations a
separate

04:08:22.229 --> 04:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
separate
 
04:08:24.750 --> 04:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
phases uh that would be one way to
 
04:08:26.710 --> 04:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
spread this out and maybe ease the pain
 
04:08:28.750 --> 04:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
of doing such a big
 
04:08:31.349 --> 04:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
project but uh we know this is coming
 
04:08:33.750 --> 04:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
and and that uh it would be a shame if
 
04:08:33.760 --> 04:08:34.670 align:start position:0%
and and that uh it would be a shame if
we

04:08:34.670 --> 04:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:08:37.790 --> 04:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't get this into shape before it
 
04:08:39.790 --> 04:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
actually failed on us and we had to shut
 
04:08:41.710 --> 04:08:41.720 align:start position:0%
down the Tramway so that's why we're
 
04:08:44.229 --> 04:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
trying to get a jump on it
 
04:08:51.630 --> 04:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:54.229 --> 04:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
question yes I just thank you Mr
 
04:08:56.149 --> 04:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
chairman I just wanted to ask the
 
04:08:58.630 --> 04:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
question when you talked about these
 
04:09:02.030 --> 04:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
controls with the floppy disc have you
 
04:09:07.550 --> 04:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:10.510 --> 04:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
this I believe that the Canon people
 
04:09:13.469 --> 04:09:13.479 align:start position:0%
have I don't know that for sure I think
 
04:09:15.469 --> 04:09:15.479 align:start position:0%
that uh they pretty much throw up their
 
04:09:17.950 --> 04:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
hands for a long time we had one
 
04:09:20.309 --> 04:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
electrician at Canon who was able to
 
04:09:22.950 --> 04:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
keep the system running so that's how
 
04:09:30.990 --> 04:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:34.229 --> 04:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
retired representative Faulkner yes
 
04:09:37.070 --> 04:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um the question is
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have this information
 
04:09:40.630 --> 04:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
available but could you explain what's
 
04:09:42.710 --> 04:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
the difference between ridership and the
 
04:09:44.269 --> 04:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
summer versus
 
04:09:46.870 --> 04:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
winter and if you have the information
 
04:09:48.990 --> 04:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
about other serves New Hampshire
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
residents versus uh people from other
 
04:09:55.349 --> 04:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
states I think that might yeah help
 
04:09:57.229 --> 04:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
understand thank you representative and
 
04:09:58.990 --> 04:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for catching the fact that it
 
04:10:01.710 --> 04:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
is important to us in in several seasons
 
04:10:04.630 --> 04:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
um I'll turn to director Phil Bryce who
 
04:10:07.109 --> 04:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
oversees the state park system and could
 
04:10:09.590 --> 04:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit more specifically to
 
04:10:12.109 --> 04:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
our ridership at the
 
04:10:16.870 --> 04:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
tra uh good uh yes good afternoon uh Mr
 
04:10:19.590 --> 04:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee uh pH
 
04:10:21.429 --> 04:10:21.439 align:start position:0%
Bry director of the division of parks
 
04:10:22.870 --> 04:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
and recreation in
 
04:10:25.510 --> 04:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
dncr uh good to be in front of you again
 
04:10:30.429 --> 04:10:30.439 align:start position:0%
two years goes fast uh the um you know
 
04:10:32.109 --> 04:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
we will get you the details on that
 
04:10:33.790 --> 04:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
information I don't have them off the
 
04:10:37.269 --> 04:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
top of my uh head alls I can say is one
 
04:10:40.229 --> 04:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
thing to uh you should know is that the
 
04:10:43.910 --> 04:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
ridership in the uh summertime and the
 
04:10:45.590 --> 04:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
revenue in the summertime is actually
 
04:10:47.870 --> 04:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
greater than what we get in the in the
 
04:10:50.910 --> 04:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
winter season so it's really not a it
 
04:10:52.950 --> 04:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
supplements the skiing experience
 
04:10:55.229 --> 04:10:55.239 align:start position:0%
because it gets you quickly and
 
04:10:57.469 --> 04:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
sheltered in high winds to The Summit in
 
04:11:00.030 --> 04:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
the wintertime which really is
 
04:11:03.510 --> 04:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
nice uh on those cold days uh and then
 
04:11:05.030 --> 04:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
you can have a wonderful run down the
 
04:11:08.070 --> 04:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
mountain but really uh it's it's an
 
04:11:12.670 --> 04:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
integral part of our uh summer and fall
 
04:11:12.680 --> 04:11:14.070 align:start position:0%
integral part of our uh summer and fall
experience

04:11:14.070 --> 04:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:11:16.950 --> 04:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
which is why Franconia Notch is rated
 
04:11:19.830 --> 04:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
anywhere between two consistently on a
 
04:11:23.630 --> 04:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
regular basis one of the top 10 20 state
 
04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
parks uh in the US so it's one of those
 
04:11:29.469 --> 04:11:29.479 align:start position:0%
experiences along with the Basin The
 
04:11:33.149 --> 04:11:33.159 align:start position:0%
Flume um echol Lake um and and the other
 
04:11:34.870 --> 04:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
the other hiking and offerings we have
 
04:11:37.710 --> 04:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
there including the camping of course so
 
04:11:40.349 --> 04:11:40.359 align:start position:0%
um I will get you those numbers but the
 
04:11:42.149 --> 04:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
important thing to recognize is that it
 
04:11:43.990 --> 04:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
really is is
 
04:11:48.510 --> 04:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
a major summer uh summer uh
 
04:11:52.030 --> 04:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
um uh uh what do we want I want to call
 
04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
traction the regarding a winner uh
 
04:11:59.070 --> 04:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
regarding uh out ofate and instate use
 
04:12:01.790 --> 04:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh generally across this park system we
 
04:12:04.109 --> 04:12:04.119 align:start position:0%
see about half half of our visitors
 
04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
based on some studies but like in the
 
04:12:10.269 --> 04:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
nadn is 80 to 90% out of state uh so I
 
04:12:12.349 --> 04:12:12.359 align:start position:0%
anticipate that it would be a high
 
04:12:14.469 --> 04:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
number whether or not we track that are
 
04:12:17.070 --> 04:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
able to to know what that number is I
 
04:12:19.389 --> 04:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
don't know other than an anally but
 
04:12:20.670 --> 04:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
that's why I need a little bit time to
 
04:12:24.670 --> 04:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:28.800 --> 04:12:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
Thompson

04:12:31.030 --> 04:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
Thompson
 
04:12:35.630 --> 04:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
um commissioner and and Tom um the $1.8
 
04:12:39.030 --> 04:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
million to paint inside those
 
04:12:42.670 --> 04:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
buildings it and correct me if I'm wrong
 
04:12:45.189 --> 04:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
is that not not steel paneling like you
 
04:12:47.950 --> 04:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
would build a steel building out
 
04:12:51.630 --> 04:12:51.640 align:start position:0%
of so we're talking uh about the Tramway
 
04:12:54.710 --> 04:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
Bays right and yes they're sort of
 
04:12:56.910 --> 04:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
halfway between interior and exterior
 
04:13:00.429 --> 04:13:00.439 align:start position:0%
because it's open to the outside and the
 
04:13:03.550 --> 04:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
steel frame is exposed and that's the
 
04:13:05.389 --> 04:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
part we're talking about painting then
 
04:13:07.950 --> 04:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
you're correct the uh the siding on that
 
04:13:11.070 --> 04:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
is a pre-finished steel panels which are
 
04:13:14.269 --> 04:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
not in such bad shape uh that they're
 
04:13:18.429 --> 04:13:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:24.109 --> 04:13:24.119 align:start position:0%
frame follow up Mr chairman follow up
 
04:13:29.550 --> 04:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
um is uh so part of the painting is not
 
04:13:33.269 --> 04:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
the steel panels it's the the super
 
04:13:36.670 --> 04:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
structure that's correct Y and there's
 
04:13:38.349 --> 04:13:38.359 align:start position:0%
there's railings and things like that
 
04:13:42.469 --> 04:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
that are also uh need to be painted but
 
04:13:43.990 --> 04:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
the main part part of it is the steel
 
04:13:46.910 --> 04:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
frame itself which is you know rusting
 
04:13:50.149 --> 04:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
badly and needs to be ground down and
 
04:13:53.830 --> 04:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:56.790 --> 04:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
repainted okay just seems like a lot of
 
04:13:59.030 --> 04:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
money for
 
04:14:01.790 --> 04:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
paint it is and I think there again uh
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
that that price I told you included
 
04:14:06.189 --> 04:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
trying to do the work while the tram is
 
04:14:09.109 --> 04:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
operating which uh on further reflection
 
04:14:11.189 --> 04:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
we realize that would require quite a
 
04:14:13.630 --> 04:14:13.640 align:start position:0%
bit of secondary con construction just
 
04:14:16.189 --> 04:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
to protect our visitors you know walking
 
04:14:18.389 --> 04:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
underneath people working up above with
 
04:14:20.510 --> 04:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
grinding equipment that's a lot to ask
 
04:14:22.149 --> 04:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
of a contractor and I think that's why
 
04:14:25.149 --> 04:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:33.870 --> 04:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
please are
 
04:14:38.229 --> 04:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
you are you going to um do you do you
 
04:14:40.149 --> 04:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
anticipate the tram is going to be open
 
04:14:41.670 --> 04:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
this coming
 
04:14:45.950 --> 04:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
season because of the pandemic um it we
 
04:14:47.950 --> 04:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a date for when we can open
 
04:14:49.590 --> 04:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
it at this point
 
04:14:56.950 --> 04:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:06.710 --> 04:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:06.720 --> 04:15:09.189 align:start position:0%
 
Mark

04:15:09.189 --> 04:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
Mark
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
Mark representative mcon unmute your
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
there you go now I'm with you Mr
 
04:15:17.349 --> 04:15:17.359 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for that um I have a
 
04:15:21.189 --> 04:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
couple questions um so if the tram goes
 
04:15:23.870 --> 04:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
down in the during your winter operation
 
04:15:27.269 --> 04:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
what percentage of your your skiers what
 
04:15:30.750 --> 04:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
what would that cut you back is I
 
04:15:33.349 --> 04:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
imagine there's some other surface uh
 
04:15:35.590 --> 04:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
some other lifts that get you there but
 
04:15:37.670 --> 04:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
if you're down during the day how much
 
04:15:39.950 --> 04:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
how much of your operation is uh
 
04:15:43.309 --> 04:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
hindered so our tram right now is closed
 
04:15:48.269 --> 04:15:48.279 align:start position:0%
due to co um we can't people into a a
 
04:15:51.910 --> 04:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
closed um tram car right now because of
 
04:15:55.389 --> 04:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
health concerns so we're operating Canon
 
04:15:57.670 --> 04:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
without the tram this winter and
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
operations are great I don't know if the
 
04:16:02.670 --> 04:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
director wants to add anything you can
 
04:16:06.910 --> 04:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
lifts okay I think i' heard
 
04:16:16.030 --> 04:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
the I was going to say 20% but 20% thank
 
04:16:19.030 --> 04:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
you I again I can get that I we can get
 
04:16:21.269 --> 04:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
that in we weren't sure how far you you
 
04:16:23.229 --> 04:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
all are going to go these are great
 
04:16:24.750 --> 04:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
questions and we've already started
 
04:16:28.309 --> 04:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
working on answering um this level of
 
04:16:30.990 --> 04:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
detail uh but of course our Focus this
 
04:16:33.710 --> 04:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
winter has been providing a safe uh
 
04:16:36.550 --> 04:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
experience for as many skiers as we can
 
04:16:38.469 --> 04:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
and we've been a little short staffed up
 
04:16:40.950 --> 04:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
there so like JD is out running lifts
 
04:16:43.750 --> 04:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
and those sorts of things we sent
 
04:16:45.510 --> 04:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
staff from conquered to go up to help
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
with a list so I apologize uh usually I
 
04:16:50.710 --> 04:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
like to have these answers in advance
 
04:16:53.189 --> 04:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
but we just haven't been able to to get
 
04:16:57.269 --> 04:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
that uh get that together so um uh what
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
I would say is that over the long term
 
04:17:02.590 --> 04:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
it changes the desirability to ski at
 
04:17:04.590 --> 04:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
Cannon when you don't have the tram
 
04:17:07.469 --> 04:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
there's a big difference between uh uh
 
04:17:09.630 --> 04:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
you know running up uh the the the
 
04:17:13.229 --> 04:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
outdoor lift uh in a nice day it's but
 
04:17:15.229 --> 04:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
running up the the the lift and then you
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
get off that lift and then you drop down
 
04:17:21.510 --> 04:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
to a second lift at the summit to go up
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
through very very wonderful beautiful
 
04:17:27.269 --> 04:17:27.279 align:start position:0%
experience but it can be very cold as
 
04:17:30.109 --> 04:17:30.119 align:start position:0%
opposed to standing in a shelter tram
 
04:17:32.670 --> 04:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
for I don't know what six how many
 
04:17:36.109 --> 04:17:36.119 align:start position:0%
minutes seven minutes uh you're talking
 
04:17:38.030 --> 04:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
quite a different experience there so I
 
04:17:40.309 --> 04:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
think what it does is it impacts the
 
04:17:43.550 --> 04:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
overall experience in the winter time
 
04:17:46.389 --> 04:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
can we get can so yes the answer is yes
 
04:17:48.830 --> 04:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
in the winter time could you get
 
04:17:52.109 --> 04:17:52.119 align:start position:0%
by um is there other ways to the summit
 
04:17:53.630 --> 04:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes there are other ways
 
04:17:56.149 --> 04:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
to the summit uh although if that that
 
04:17:58.229 --> 04:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
lift goes down which does happen you
 
04:17:59.830 --> 04:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
know it's nice to have an alternative to
 
04:18:01.670 --> 04:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
get people to the because skiing the top
 
04:18:03.510 --> 04:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
of that mountain is absolutely
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
unreal uh uh it's the summertime that uh
 
04:18:10.189 --> 04:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
and fall that are that are uh that you
 
04:18:12.429 --> 04:18:12.439 align:start position:0%
know where we can't really replace that
 
04:18:15.070 --> 04:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
experience it the same
 
04:18:18.149 --> 04:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
way commissioner Quinn we'll be right
 
04:18:20.349 --> 04:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
with you we're running a little over as
 
04:18:21.670 --> 04:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
you figured
 
04:18:29.870 --> 04:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
you representative mcon you had a
 
04:18:35.070 --> 04:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
followup yeah thank you Mr chairman just
 
04:18:39.630 --> 04:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
to finish up so um you have a 40 40 year
 
04:18:42.229 --> 04:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
old uh method of transportation to get
 
04:18:44.269 --> 04:18:44.279 align:start position:0%
people to top of the mountain have you
 
04:18:45.750 --> 04:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to tell me now you
 
04:18:47.870 --> 04:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
get back another time I don't like to
 
04:18:51.030 --> 04:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
delay commissioner Quinn uh what's the
 
04:18:53.109 --> 04:18:53.119 align:start position:0%
price to start a fresh with something
 
04:18:55.830 --> 04:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's more efficient HS more people or
 
04:18:59.990 --> 04:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:03.109 --> 04:19:03.119 align:start position:0%
new we have preliminary
 
04:19:06.790 --> 04:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
numbers in the 40 to $50 million range
 
04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
if we were to switch over to Gondola
 
04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
cars for example that means all the uh
 
04:19:13.830 --> 04:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
all the infrastructure we have built for
 
04:19:16.189 --> 04:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
the Tramway couldn't be reused for the
 
04:19:19.990 --> 04:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
new system like that so it's a big high
 
04:19:21.070 --> 04:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
jump to do
 
04:19:24.149 --> 04:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you I'm finished Mr
 
04:19:30.670 --> 04:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
Thompson just a quick question what's
 
04:19:36.670 --> 04:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
the economic effect of not having that
 
04:19:39.109 --> 04:19:39.119 align:start position:0%
Tramway running during the winter season
 
04:19:41.750 --> 04:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
I I don't know what it cost for a ticket
 
04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
there or if there
 
04:19:46.309 --> 04:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
additional cost to go up the Tramway how
 
04:19:48.750 --> 04:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
much money are you losing by having that
 
04:19:48.760 --> 04:19:49.510 align:start position:0%
much money are you losing by having that
that

04:19:49.510 --> 04:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:49.520 --> 04:19:52.229 align:start position:0%
that
down

04:19:52.229 --> 04:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
down
 
04:19:56.510 --> 04:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
and good question uh Mr chair we again
 
04:19:58.710 --> 04:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say when you don't we we
 
04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
won't know till you know we see that
 
04:20:05.950 --> 04:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
impact of fewer people skiing
 
04:20:09.830 --> 04:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
Canon um so and that's why we'll get the
 
04:20:11.790 --> 04:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
numbers on the number of people that we
 
04:20:13.710 --> 04:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
feel that are used
 
04:20:18.670 --> 04:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
that tram um in the uh winter time in
 
04:20:21.710 --> 04:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
the summertime I think it's somewhere
 
04:20:23.830 --> 04:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
around a million and a half or more in
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
terms of Revenue so um that we would
 
04:20:29.790 --> 04:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
that we would uh lose so but I'll
 
04:20:31.429 --> 04:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
confirm that number as
 
04:20:34.149 --> 04:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
well all right thank you very much
 
04:20:36.109 --> 04:20:36.119 align:start position:0%
representative fauler for the final
 
04:20:38.070 --> 04:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
question on this subject all right I'm
 
04:20:40.109 --> 04:20:40.119 align:start position:0%
gonna pass thanks
 
04:20:44.990 --> 04:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
um commissioner thank you you've given
 
04:20:49.990 --> 04:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
us a lot to think about about the
 
04:20:53.990 --> 04:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
Tramway I do have one question with the
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
age of this Tramway is it impacting on
 
04:21:00.149 --> 04:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
our insurance
 
04:21:06.349 --> 04:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:09.349 --> 04:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
use uh Chris Marino is that a question
 
04:21:11.109 --> 04:21:11.119 align:start position:0%
you can answer right now or can we
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
follow up with that information
 
04:21:19.309 --> 04:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:22.229 --> 04:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
that again thank you you have anything
 
04:21:24.389 --> 04:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
finally you want to add uh commissioner
 
04:21:26.750 --> 04:21:26.760 align:start position:0%

2223 bium the department of safety is
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
requesting funding for just one Capital
 
04:22:24.429 --> 04:22:24.439 align:start position:0%
project this project will upgrade the
 
04:22:27.109 --> 04:22:27.119 align:start position:0%
technology and operations at the state
 
04:22:30.429 --> 04:22:30.439 align:start position:0%
Emergency Operations Center also known
 
04:22:33.510 --> 04:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
as the EOC which is located in the
 
04:22:35.790 --> 04:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
incident planning and operations center
 
04:22:39.269 --> 04:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
commonly referred to as the IPO and
 
04:22:41.670 --> 04:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's on Smokey be Bullard the
 
04:22:44.070 --> 04:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
emergency Operation Center is activated
 
04:22:47.189 --> 04:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
during natural or man-made disasters and
 
04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
serves as the Hub of New Hampshire's
 
04:22:51.950 --> 04:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
emergency response when activated the
 
04:22:54.630 --> 04:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
EOC utilizes the emergency support
 
04:22:58.229 --> 04:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
function ESF structure to coordinate a
 
04:23:01.670 --> 04:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
federal inter agency support for
 
04:23:03.790 --> 04:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
response to the
 
04:23:06.149 --> 04:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
incidents this system promotes an
 
04:23:08.229 --> 04:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
effective response utilizing all
 
04:23:12.510 --> 04:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
available state federal and nonprofit
 
04:23:14.910 --> 04:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
Volunteer Partners and resources to
 
04:23:18.030 --> 04:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
assist on March 13th of last year as
 
04:23:20.990 --> 04:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
many of you know the EOC was activated
 
04:23:23.149 --> 04:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
in response to the federally declared
 
04:23:27.309 --> 04:23:27.319 align:start position:0%
disaster from Corona virus and covid-19
 
04:23:30.309 --> 04:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
since that time a unified command
 
04:23:33.109 --> 04:23:33.119 align:start position:0%
structure was established to oversee all
 
04:23:36.030 --> 04:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
of the esfs staffed by individuals from
 
04:23:38.550 --> 04:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
across different state agencies
 
04:23:40.910 --> 04:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
including the Department of Safety
 
04:23:43.070 --> 04:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:23:45.389 --> 04:23:45.399 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
04:23:47.630 --> 04:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology and
 
04:23:50.469 --> 04:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire National guide levels
 
04:23:53.149 --> 04:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
of activation have varied throughout the
 
04:23:56.550 --> 04:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
response this
 
04:24:00.550 --> 04:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
$750,000 Capital request is for upgrades
 
04:24:03.309 --> 04:24:03.319 align:start position:0%
to the technology and overall
 
04:24:06.469 --> 04:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
operational functionality of the
 
04:24:09.830 --> 04:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
eocc this project will ensure that the
 
04:24:12.950 --> 04:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
EOC is ready to provide an effective
 
04:24:15.910 --> 04:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
coordinated and datadriven response to
 
04:24:18.429 --> 04:24:18.439 align:start position:0%
disasters in New Hampshire now I would
 
04:24:20.990 --> 04:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
like Steve Lavoy who's joined us to go
 
04:24:25.149 --> 04:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
into uh a few more details on the um um
 
04:24:27.550 --> 04:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
different facets of this project good
 
04:24:29.830 --> 04:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon Steve and thanks for joining
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
us thank you commissioner uh good
 
04:24:34.750 --> 04:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh Mr chair members of the
 
04:24:37.429 --> 04:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
committee um so as a commissioner noted
 
04:24:39.990 --> 04:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
there are three uh components of this
 
04:24:41.990 --> 04:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
request um there's an Audio Video
 
04:24:45.389 --> 04:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
Control rer display the technology um
 
04:24:47.469 --> 04:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
integration into our conference rooms
 
04:24:49.189 --> 04:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
and planning rooms and then also
 
04:24:51.990 --> 04:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
Furniture functionality upgrade and so
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
the first phase of this would be to
 
04:24:57.670 --> 04:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
upgrade the existing technology within
 
04:25:00.349 --> 04:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
the audio video controller display the
 
04:25:03.389 --> 04:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
current video display was installed in
 
04:25:06.990 --> 04:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
2007 uh it's now it's now obsolete we've
 
04:25:08.950 --> 04:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
been maintaining this to the best of our
 
04:25:11.149 --> 04:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
ability but the reality is that
 
04:25:13.790 --> 04:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
technology has changed since then and
 
04:25:15.510 --> 04:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
the volume and the quality of the
 
04:25:17.790 --> 04:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
digital information that we have
 
04:25:19.950 --> 04:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
available to us and that we need during
 
04:25:22.469 --> 04:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
emergency response just can't be handled
 
04:25:25.269 --> 04:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
by the current system um the controllers
 
04:25:27.229 --> 04:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
are shown here on the top picture you
 
04:25:29.309 --> 04:25:29.319 align:start position:0%
can see that this entire section has to
 
04:25:31.870 --> 04:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
do with the processing the data um and
 
04:25:34.269 --> 04:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
then this is the computer screen that we
 
04:25:37.189 --> 04:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
use to control the um the system as a
 
04:25:39.870 --> 04:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
whole so the current system is a three
 
04:25:42.510 --> 04:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
screen three projector system these are
 
04:25:44.109 --> 04:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
the three projectors shown here in the
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
middle picture the screen itself the
 
04:25:48.070 --> 04:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
screens are up here on the on the
 
04:25:51.389 --> 04:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
opposite wall um as I mentioned those
 
04:25:53.830 --> 04:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
projectors have limited ability to
 
04:25:56.189 --> 04:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
process current digital video uh and
 
04:25:59.229 --> 04:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
audio and they've become unreliable we
 
04:26:01.830 --> 04:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
actually had one of the projectors fail
 
04:26:03.950 --> 04:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh in the early months of our covid-19
 
04:26:06.469 --> 04:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
response activation which required us to
 
04:26:09.109 --> 04:26:09.119 align:start position:0%
scramble to purchase and install and
 
04:26:10.950 --> 04:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
reconfigure a new piece of equipment in
 
04:26:13.870 --> 04:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
the middle of a disaster response um the
 
04:26:15.950 --> 04:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
picture quality which you can probably
 
04:26:18.269 --> 04:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
tell from this photo here is not high
 
04:26:20.950 --> 04:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
definition uh it makes it difficult to
 
04:26:23.910 --> 04:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
see fine details in some of the data and
 
04:26:27.309 --> 04:26:27.319 align:start position:0%
it's also very um it's very faint so so
 
04:26:28.670 --> 04:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
depending on where you're standing
 
04:26:31.109 --> 04:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
within the room uh it's it's difficult
 
04:26:33.550 --> 04:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
to uh see all the data that we'd like
 
04:26:35.030 --> 04:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
all the different support functions to
 
04:26:36.910 --> 04:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
have access to during their
 
04:26:39.469 --> 04:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
response um so obviously upgrading this
 
04:26:41.590 --> 04:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
video controller and the screen package
 
04:26:43.830 --> 04:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
is is important to make sure that we can
 
04:26:46.109 --> 04:26:46.119 align:start position:0%
continue to provide um the real-time
 
04:26:48.429 --> 04:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
data that our emergency response teams
 
04:26:51.790 --> 04:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
need when when responding during an
 
04:26:54.870 --> 04:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
emergency the second part of this
 
04:26:58.070 --> 04:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
project would integrate that audio vi
 
04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
video technology within all of the other
 
04:27:03.670 --> 04:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
conference rooms um as well as some uh
 
04:27:06.189 --> 04:27:06.199 align:start position:0%
other areas outside of the IPO that we
 
04:27:08.149 --> 04:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
use for coordinating resources across
 
04:27:10.670 --> 04:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
the state so that includes the situation
 
04:27:13.149 --> 04:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
room within the IPO the governor's
 
04:27:15.910 --> 04:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
office within the EOC uh all the call
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
center rooms various um meeting places
 
04:27:21.269 --> 04:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
within the IPO including the hscm
 
04:27:23.910 --> 04:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
library but then also integrating with
 
04:27:25.830 --> 04:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
um the National Guard distance learning
 
04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
lab uh and Joint operations center which
 
04:27:30.830 --> 04:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
serves as as as one of our Coupe
 
04:27:34.109 --> 04:27:34.119 align:start position:0%
locations um also Newington office space
 
04:27:36.670 --> 04:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
in Newington we have related to um our
 
04:27:39.229 --> 04:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
shared responsibilities over seab Brook
 
04:27:41.109 --> 04:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
response and then the commissioner's
 
04:27:43.469 --> 04:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
office here at the department of safety
 
04:27:45.590 --> 04:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
and it's important that all these uh
 
04:27:47.510 --> 04:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
areas have access to the same level of
 
04:27:50.229 --> 04:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
data uh because really the the
 
04:27:52.670 --> 04:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility at hscm is to coordinate
 
04:27:55.030 --> 04:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
our Statewide resources for a
 
04:27:57.229 --> 04:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
coordinated response and so conference
 
04:27:59.030 --> 04:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
calls and videos of meetings and
 
04:28:01.590 --> 04:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
Leadership level planning all happens um
 
04:28:03.910 --> 04:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
at various locations and they all need
 
04:28:05.830 --> 04:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
that same data that's being broadcast
 
04:28:09.109 --> 04:28:09.119 align:start position:0%
onto the EOC wall um and so these
 
04:28:10.910 --> 04:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
upgrades would allow us to do that
 
04:28:12.590 --> 04:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
that's a gap that we currently we have
 
04:28:15.030 --> 04:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
in our response uh so people are limited
 
04:28:16.790 --> 04:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
to what they can access based on who's
 
04:28:19.630 --> 04:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
in the room and what um what permissions
 
04:28:21.389 --> 04:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
they have at that point in
 
04:28:24.309 --> 04:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
time and then finally the third part uh
 
04:28:26.269 --> 04:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
third phase of this project would be to
 
04:28:28.550 --> 04:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
upgrade the furniture um and the
 
04:28:30.189 --> 04:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
functionality of the furniture within
 
04:28:33.830 --> 04:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
the existing seoc So currently there are
 
04:28:38.030 --> 04:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
38 workstations that have been set up um
 
04:28:40.149 --> 04:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
each of them designated for a certain
 
04:28:42.710 --> 04:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
emergency uh support function
 
04:28:44.590 --> 04:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
so these functions might be there's one
 
04:28:46.189 --> 04:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
for transportation there's one for
 
04:28:48.309 --> 04:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
health uh and medical there's one for
 
04:28:50.870 --> 04:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
Military Support cyber security so each
 
04:28:52.550 --> 04:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
one of these emergency support functions
 
04:28:55.710 --> 04:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
has a dedicated space and um you can see
 
04:28:58.109 --> 04:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
uh a picture of the entire space here
 
04:28:59.910 --> 04:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
with all the different workstations and
 
04:29:01.469 --> 04:29:01.479 align:start position:0%
here's a closeup of what each one of
 
04:29:04.229 --> 04:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
those workstations looks like um these
 
04:29:07.070 --> 04:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
have met our needs uh up to this point
 
04:29:09.950 --> 04:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
um but the covid-19 pandemic brought
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
forward some of the limitations that we
 
04:29:14.590 --> 04:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
have here one of which being um concerns
 
04:29:16.710 --> 04:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
related to social distancing and more
 
04:29:18.510 --> 04:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility in in these seating
 
04:29:20.710 --> 04:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
arrangements and so more modular
 
04:29:23.389 --> 04:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
Furniture would allow us to uh better
 
04:29:25.870 --> 04:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
respond while also maintaining social
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
distancing if there's another type of a
 
04:29:30.950 --> 04:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
public response that uh requires that
 
04:29:33.349 --> 04:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
that type of um that type of response on
 
04:29:36.670 --> 04:29:36.680 align:start position:0%
our behalf um right now the other
 
04:29:38.630 --> 04:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
challenge that we have with this setup
 
04:29:41.070 --> 04:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
is that it's common for us to coordinate
 
04:29:45.109 --> 04:29:45.119 align:start position:0%
between esfs and these Furniture pieces
 
04:29:48.349 --> 04:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
don't allow us to be more module modular
 
04:29:51.469 --> 04:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
and allow us to combine um where where
 
04:29:53.750 --> 04:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
we may maybe we need four esfs to be
 
04:29:56.510 --> 04:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
working on a single project uh for three
 
04:29:58.309 --> 04:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
days out of the week but they're located
 
04:30:00.710 --> 04:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
at different locations across this room
 
04:30:02.590 --> 04:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
um now we have to rely on conference
 
04:30:04.429 --> 04:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
space and again we're talking about you
 
04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
go into the conference space and you
 
04:30:07.830 --> 04:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
lose access to some of the data so
 
04:30:10.189 --> 04:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
modular furniture will allow us to
 
04:30:12.149 --> 04:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
better respond and coordinate between
 
04:30:14.349 --> 04:30:14.359 align:start position:0%
our existing folks within the EOC when
 
04:30:14.359 --> 04:30:16.189 align:start position:0%
our existing folks within the EOC when
it's

04:30:16.189 --> 04:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
activated um so that the sum of those
 
04:30:21.590 --> 04:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
three projects which we would phase and
 
04:30:25.030 --> 04:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
Implement in that order uh is
 
04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
$750,000 um that's the total of the
 
04:30:30.710 --> 04:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
requests that that we're asking um for
 
04:30:34.109 --> 04:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
to be funded in the 2223 budget uh and
 
04:30:36.389 --> 04:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to answer any questions
 
04:30:39.630 --> 04:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:44.030 --> 04:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
have questions representative Jack uh
 
04:30:45.349 --> 04:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
04:30:47.870 --> 04:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner for coming uh am I correct
 
04:30:49.950 --> 04:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
that the EOC has basically been
 
04:30:52.510 --> 04:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
continuously activated for almost a year
 
04:30:54.870 --> 04:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
since that day in March that we all
 
04:30:58.429 --> 04:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:02.429 --> 04:31:02.439 align:start position:0%
home a dramatic difference from uh the
 
04:31:04.109 --> 04:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
way it used to be used where it would be
 
04:31:05.830 --> 04:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
activated for a few days for something
 
04:31:09.229 --> 04:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
and then sort of shut down well well
 
04:31:12.429 --> 04:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
actually um yes so the first part you're
 
04:31:15.469 --> 04:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
correct in the first answer we opened it
 
04:31:18.429 --> 04:31:18.439 align:start position:0%
March 10th they have taken you know here
 
04:31:20.830 --> 04:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
and there a weekend off couple days but
 
04:31:23.149 --> 04:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
it's primarily been seven days a week
 
04:31:26.189 --> 04:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
and um but depending on what the
 
04:31:28.870 --> 04:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
disaster is kind of drives how long you
 
04:31:30.510 --> 04:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
know they stay open into what I mean
 
04:31:33.309 --> 04:31:33.319 align:start position:0%
we've had some significant you know uh
 
04:31:36.229 --> 04:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
ice storms which had extended EOC
 
04:31:39.269 --> 04:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
operations 24 hours a day but no to your
 
04:31:41.030 --> 04:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
point this has been the longest run ever
 
04:31:43.710 --> 04:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
in this or uh March 10th we opened it up
 
04:31:47.630 --> 04:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
and they are continuing and also the EOC
 
04:31:50.030 --> 04:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
has been utilized you know you know not
 
04:31:51.870 --> 04:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
only on Co but other events like the
 
04:31:54.550 --> 04:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
protests we've had and other issues uh
 
04:31:57.670 --> 04:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
um other storms and whatnot so yes to
 
04:31:57.680 --> 04:31:59.349 align:start position:0%
um other storms and whatnot so yes to
both

04:31:59.349 --> 04:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
both
 
04:32:10.149 --> 04:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:12.830 --> 04:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
Abbott thank you Mr
 
04:32:15.950 --> 04:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
um and thank you commissioner for taking
 
04:32:18.550 --> 04:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
the question we heard
 
04:32:22.109 --> 04:32:22.119 align:start position:0%
earlier from the Department of Natural
 
04:32:23.630 --> 04:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
and cultural
 
04:32:26.710 --> 04:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
resources um that this
 
04:32:29.590 --> 04:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
system um could
 
04:32:32.349 --> 04:32:32.359 align:start position:0%
accommodate their emergency response
 
04:32:35.590 --> 04:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
systems and I just wondered if it would
 
04:32:40.990 --> 04:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
be I mean how how big could it be I mean
 
04:32:41.000 --> 04:32:42.389 align:start position:0%
be I mean how how big could it be I mean
besides

04:32:42.389 --> 04:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
besides
 
04:32:47.550 --> 04:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
um just natural resources and I
 
04:32:52.830 --> 04:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
mean how big could the uh technology and
 
04:32:57.189 --> 04:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
operations upgrade accommodate other
 
04:33:00.429 --> 04:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
departments well it does now I mean so
 
04:33:03.349 --> 04:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
this is this serves the entire state so
 
04:33:06.150 --> 04:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
if there was an issue that impacted dncr
 
04:33:09.470 --> 04:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
or do or any you know any area in the
 
04:33:12.470 --> 04:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
state that's what it does so this this
 
04:33:15.070 --> 04:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
upgrade here will have the capacity to
 
04:33:17.390 --> 04:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
meet the needs web EOC the video
 
04:33:22.590 --> 04:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
streaming so so um so no matter what the
 
04:33:27.109 --> 04:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
event is this technology is required
 
04:33:29.590 --> 04:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
does that answer sir so yes this will
 
04:33:32.230 --> 04:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
this will if there was any issue that
 
04:33:35.070 --> 04:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
dncr um required you know there was a
 
04:33:35.080 --> 04:33:38.269 align:start position:0%
dncr um required you know there was a
disaster

04:33:38.269 --> 04:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:41.869 --> 04:33:41.879 align:start position:0%
that would be activated
 
04:33:41.879 --> 04:33:44.150 align:start position:0%
that would be activated
representative

04:33:44.150 --> 04:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
eel thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:33:49.189 --> 04:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner um I was just curious what
 
04:33:52.029 --> 04:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
portion of your request was the
 
04:33:54.910 --> 04:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
furniture then I have a
 
04:33:57.070 --> 04:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
followup Steve do you have the breakdown
 
04:33:59.551 --> 04:33:59.561 align:start position:0%
on that yeah I can I I can answer that
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
so I mentioned there were three phases
 
04:34:04.189 --> 04:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
and obviously these are estimates um but
 
04:34:05.990 --> 04:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
we were estimating breaking that up
 
04:34:07.990 --> 04:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
evenly so we've got
 
04:34:10.189 --> 04:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
250,000 um for each section that would
 
04:34:12.949 --> 04:34:12.959 align:start position:0%
include the furniture um um if that that
 
04:34:15.670 --> 04:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit conservative um of
 
04:34:17.830 --> 04:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
of of of an amount but we want to make
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
sure that we do this
 
04:34:23.990 --> 04:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
right followup Mr chair followup um I
 
04:34:26.510 --> 04:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
just wondered in general if you consider
 
04:34:29.349 --> 04:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
Furniture a capital investment or is it
 
04:34:29.359 --> 04:34:31.910 align:start position:0%
Furniture a capital investment or is it
more

04:34:31.910 --> 04:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:34.990 --> 04:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
operations yeah I think it depends on
 
04:34:36.830 --> 04:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
the situation that's a very that's a
 
04:34:39.990 --> 04:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's a good question um in this case
 
04:34:41.869 --> 04:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
because of the specialized nature of
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
this furniture um and uh and the use in
 
04:34:47.629 --> 04:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
this capacity we would treat it um a
 
04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
little bit differently than say an
 
04:34:51.910 --> 04:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
office set for an administrative
 
04:34:53.990 --> 04:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
position within a different area of the
 
04:34:55.990 --> 04:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
department so in this particular
 
04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
application we we are treating this more
 
04:35:01.269 --> 04:35:01.279 align:start position:0%
as equipment um than necessarily a desk
 
04:35:04.470 --> 04:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
and chair set yeah and that's a great
 
04:35:06.070 --> 04:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
question representative eil and I just
 
04:35:07.709 --> 04:35:07.719 align:start position:0%
just to add to it too I think it is
 
04:35:09.470 --> 04:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
important to tie it into this project
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
only because where they sit how they're
 
04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
situated the equipment that ties into to
 
04:35:18.510 --> 04:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
those workstations it all kind of has to
 
04:35:20.990 --> 04:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
has to be pulled together to make sure
 
04:35:23.349 --> 04:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
that it um that the Investments we have
 
04:35:28.230 --> 04:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
in um in in number two you know line up
 
04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
with with the people that have to man
 
04:35:31.199 --> 04:35:32.949 align:start position:0%
with with the people that have to man
the

04:35:32.949 --> 04:35:32.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:35:36.070 --> 04:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
EOC thank you
 
04:35:39.029 --> 04:35:39.039 align:start position:0%
commit commissioner on that I think it
 
04:35:41.709 --> 04:35:41.719 align:start position:0%
is better to have it under one our
 
04:35:43.869 --> 04:35:43.879 align:start position:0%
remember one of your predecessors when
 
04:35:47.349 --> 04:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
we were first developing and Staffing
 
04:35:51.189 --> 04:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
and equipping the EOC he went out and
 
04:35:54.709 --> 04:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
made every Department cough up money to
 
04:35:58.990 --> 04:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
do their own portion of of the EOC and I
 
04:36:00.949 --> 04:36:00.959 align:start position:0%
think it caused some problems with
 
04:36:05.029 --> 04:36:05.039 align:start position:0%
compatibility and and the rest uh so I
 
04:36:06.830 --> 04:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
think it's better to have it all Under
 
04:36:09.910 --> 04:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
One Roof one project that's gr I'm
 
04:36:13.310 --> 04:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
talking not necessar early the gospel
 
04:36:14.750 --> 04:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
yeah well I'll tell you I've learned a
 
04:36:17.109 --> 04:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
lot you know by going out and talking to
 
04:36:20.510 --> 04:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
employees and one would never uh imagine
 
04:36:22.551 --> 04:36:22.561 align:start position:0%
how important the correct chair is to a
 
04:36:25.510 --> 04:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
911 telecommunicator who has to sit you
 
04:36:26.990 --> 04:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
know what I'm saying or our dispatches
 
04:36:28.869 --> 04:36:28.879 align:start position:0%
so it is a piece of equipment that you
 
04:36:31.470 --> 04:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
know as as a cruiser is vital to you
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
know the the state troopers the um you
 
04:36:36.830 --> 04:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
know the the the equipment for our
 
04:36:38.670 --> 04:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
dispatchers and folks that have to man
 
04:36:41.109 --> 04:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
the EOC you know for extended periods is
 
04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
is is important but but thank you for
 
04:36:45.869 --> 04:36:45.879 align:start position:0%
the support with
 
04:36:50.109 --> 04:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
that any other questions for the
 
04:36:51.949 --> 04:36:51.959 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
04:36:54.869 --> 04:36:54.879 align:start position:0%
Safety seeing none commissioner thank
 
04:36:58.189 --> 04:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
you uh for appearing and do you have
 
04:37:01.670 --> 04:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
anything you want to add at the end here
 
04:37:03.269 --> 04:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
no I don't I'm just glad that you
 
04:37:06.029 --> 04:37:06.039 align:start position:0%
welcomed our um folks from uh the
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
division of Emergency Services

electrical building which is operating
 
04:46:38.150 --> 04:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
the way that we had envisioned uh so
 
04:46:41.628 --> 04:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and today I have with me
 
04:46:44.110 --> 04:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
first I'm wearing a different hat um I'm
 
04:46:45.830 --> 04:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
learning in New Hampshire that
 
04:46:49.310 --> 04:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
retirement is is not a a steady state
 
04:46:51.750 --> 04:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
that that you end up coming back so here
 
04:46:54.150 --> 04:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
I am as the interim Chancellor uh
 
04:46:56.670 --> 04:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
through the end of June so with me I've
 
04:46:59.190 --> 04:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
brought my own team of experts Shannon
 
04:47:00.990 --> 04:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
Reed whom I think many of you know who
 
04:47:04.910 --> 04:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
is our legislative affairs person Scott
 
04:47:08.190 --> 04:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
Fields who is our new chief of
 
04:47:10.350 --> 04:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
operations and another face that I
 
04:47:12.708 --> 04:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
suspect is very familiar to you Matt
 
04:47:15.628 --> 04:47:15.638 align:start position:0%
Moore who is in charge of our capital
 
04:47:19.948 --> 04:47:19.958 align:start position:0%
projects so we have uh sent you uh a
 
04:47:22.270 --> 04:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
short uh series of slides I'm going to
 
04:47:24.548 --> 04:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
just touch on a couple of them I'll
 
04:47:26.510 --> 04:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
begin by answering the first question we
 
04:47:28.990 --> 04:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
were asked to address which is you know
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
what what was funded in the governor's
 
04:47:33.750 --> 04:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
budget in the governor's budget what was
 
04:47:37.150 --> 04:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
funded was an earmark for Nashville
 
04:47:38.830 --> 04:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
Community College to complete the
 
04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
renovations to the engineering program
 
04:47:43.948 --> 04:47:43.958 align:start position:0%
program having said that you also are
 
04:47:46.190 --> 04:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
giving us the opportunity to talk about
 
04:47:48.390 --> 04:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
us and what we had proposed originally
 
04:47:51.868 --> 04:47:51.878 align:start position:0%
so I'm pleased to do that um as you can
 
04:47:53.670 --> 04:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
see right now on the screen just a
 
04:47:56.310 --> 04:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
little overview of of who we are and who
 
04:48:00.110 --> 04:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
we serve we serve about 26,000 students
 
04:48:01.470 --> 04:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh this year I think our youngest
 
04:48:03.708 --> 04:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
student is 16 and our most seasoned
 
04:48:07.948 --> 04:48:07.958 align:start position:0%
student is in her 70s so we we cover the
 
04:48:11.948 --> 04:48:11.958 align:start position:0%
the the gamut of Ages and we do this
 
04:48:14.510 --> 04:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
across the entire State of New Hampshire
 
04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
as you probably know within the goal is
 
04:48:22.230 --> 04:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
that within about half an hour 25 miles
 
04:48:23.948 --> 04:48:23.958 align:start position:0%
any Resident of the State of New
 
04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can get to either one of our
 
04:48:29.590 --> 04:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
seven colleges or one of our five
 
04:48:31.350 --> 04:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
instructional locations spread
 
04:48:34.190 --> 04:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and we are in fact
 
04:48:37.350 --> 04:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
the lowest College tuition in the state
 
04:48:41.070 --> 04:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
public or private at this moment and we
 
04:48:43.110 --> 04:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
function with hundreds of Partnerships
 
04:48:45.430 --> 04:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
with businesses in fact we've got a few
 
04:48:48.110 --> 04:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
pages just to show you who it is we do
 
04:48:49.910 --> 04:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
business with and maybe the most
 
04:48:51.868 --> 04:48:51.878 align:start position:0%
important piece is that we're here to
 
04:48:54.310 --> 04:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
serve New Hampshire residents in fact
 
04:48:57.430 --> 04:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
93% of our students are from the state
 
04:49:00.190 --> 04:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire next slide
 
04:49:04.590 --> 04:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
Chen so in terms of our Capital needs we
 
04:49:06.628 --> 04:49:06.638 align:start position:0%
have four priorities critical
 
04:49:08.628 --> 04:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
maintenance as you know we have lots of
 
04:49:11.310 --> 04:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
buildings across our camp
 
04:49:13.948 --> 04:49:13.958 align:start position:0%
campuses we're also very focused on
 
04:49:17.350 --> 04:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
maintaining our it technology uh
 
04:49:19.830 --> 04:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and in fact that has
 
04:49:21.628 --> 04:49:21.638 align:start position:0%
served us so very well through the
 
04:49:23.948 --> 04:49:23.958 align:start position:0%
pandemic you've heard about lots of the
 
04:49:27.430 --> 04:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
colleges and how they've had to uh Go
 
04:49:29.150 --> 04:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
Remote at times and then come back on
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
campus and they've got to do testing and
 
04:49:32.948 --> 04:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
so on our needs were a little bit
 
04:49:34.910 --> 04:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
different because our students are in
 
04:49:37.708 --> 04:49:37.718 align:start position:0%
and of the community so our ability to
 
04:49:40.708 --> 04:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
support them through our it
 
04:49:43.030 --> 04:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure has played a a key role
 
04:49:46.470 --> 04:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
and and we've we've continued on our way
 
04:49:49.990 --> 04:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
to meet the industry pathway programs um
 
04:49:52.628 --> 04:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with them probably in
 
04:49:55.708 --> 04:49:55.718 align:start position:0%
automotive um I was uh betraying my
 
04:49:58.948 --> 04:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
Manchester Roots before I'll also say
 
04:50:00.990 --> 04:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
there's a great program there uh
 
04:50:02.990 --> 04:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
connection with eversource for line
 
04:50:05.868 --> 04:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
worker programs you uh actually most
 
04:50:08.430 --> 04:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
recently gave Manchester money to
 
04:50:10.990 --> 04:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
convert a lab to continue that program
 
04:50:12.628 --> 04:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
the last week I was there they were
 
04:50:14.590 --> 04:50:14.600 align:start position:0%
interviewing students for the class
 
04:50:17.110 --> 04:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
that's currently in session and 150
 
04:50:21.190 --> 04:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
people showed up for 15 slots so uh
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's a great interest a great need
 
04:50:26.030 --> 04:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
and and a terrific program and finally
 
04:50:28.708 --> 04:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
our focus on spending the money that you
 
04:50:32.110 --> 04:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
give us and others as well as we can we
 
04:50:34.270 --> 04:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh we really do want to pinch our
 
04:50:36.670 --> 04:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
pennies Matt has kept us focused on
 
04:50:44.030 --> 04:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
again a slide that just makes the point
 
04:50:47.590 --> 04:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
that we're serving the folks that are
 
04:50:50.270 --> 04:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
here Shannon will go on to the next one
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
please um this is a slide that really
 
04:50:56.750 --> 04:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm proudest of we are a good return
 
04:50:59.110 --> 04:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
on your money and in fact we have
 
04:51:01.310 --> 04:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
National standing in the success of
 
04:51:04.708 --> 04:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
helping people to move by the age of 30
 
04:51:08.470 --> 04:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
to two economic quartiles above their
 
04:51:11.590 --> 04:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
parents for me as a parent this is the
 
04:51:13.470 --> 04:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
proof that we are doing what every
 
04:51:15.548 --> 04:51:15.558 align:start position:0%
parent desires which is to give their
 
04:51:18.750 --> 04:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
children a better life than they've had
 
04:51:20.590 --> 04:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
and your investment in our community
 
04:51:23.070 --> 04:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
colleges in fact is assuring that we're
 
04:51:25.628 --> 04:51:25.638 align:start position:0%
doing that uh you can see two examples
 
04:51:29.110 --> 04:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
here of national ranking one for nasua
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
and one for White Mountains Community
 
04:51:33.548 --> 04:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
College next
 
04:51:36.110 --> 04:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
slide a couple of other things we
 
04:51:37.830 --> 04:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
actually have the highest graduation
 
04:51:40.708 --> 04:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
rate for community colleges in New
 
04:51:43.310 --> 04:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
England we're still working at this and
 
04:51:45.670 --> 04:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
if you see the the national statistics
 
04:51:48.390 --> 04:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it's 36% but what what
 
04:51:52.590 --> 04:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
that 36% represents is people who began
 
04:51:53.948 --> 04:51:53.958 align:start position:0%
first time
 
04:51:56.548 --> 04:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
full-time and then graduated within a
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
three-year period our students are
 
04:52:01.548 --> 04:52:01.558 align:start position:0%
profoundly affected by what's happening
 
04:52:04.548 --> 04:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
in the economy and in fact people who do
 
04:52:07.030 --> 04:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
graduate don't necessarily graduate
 
04:52:08.590 --> 04:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
within the three-year period if they
 
04:52:10.030 --> 04:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
start off this full-time and life
 
04:52:11.470 --> 04:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
changes and they've got to go out and
 
04:52:13.708 --> 04:52:13.718 align:start position:0%
work they still keep at it with us and
 
04:52:16.990 --> 04:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
they still graduate so they may graduate
 
04:52:18.868 --> 04:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
on The Five-Year Plan or the six-year
 
04:52:21.470 --> 04:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
plan I make that point just to emphasize
 
04:52:24.110 --> 04:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
exactly how flexible we are but also how
 
04:52:27.510 --> 04:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
focused we are on successful
 
04:52:30.590 --> 04:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
completion um and so let's go on to the
 
04:52:34.708 --> 04:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
next page and we have pictures uh so
 
04:52:37.270 --> 04:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
first we have pictures of the recent
 
04:52:39.270 --> 04:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
project the HVAC project that I had
 
04:52:41.310 --> 04:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
spoken to you about
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
um we also have the manufacturing lab
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
and the next page you've done nursing
 
04:52:48.990 --> 04:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
you've done culinary Automotive you can
 
04:52:52.030 --> 04:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
see the whole range of programs that
 
04:52:55.750 --> 04:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
you've affected most recently clinical
 
04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
Labs um at what three of the colleges so
 
04:53:03.350 --> 04:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
that brings me to talking about what it
 
04:53:06.510 --> 04:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
was we had originally put together our
 
04:53:12.150 --> 04:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
request for the fy22 23 budget was 16.8
 
04:53:16.150 --> 04:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
million and you can see from the chart
 
04:53:18.948 --> 04:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
how it is we proposed or what it is we
 
04:53:22.590 --> 04:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
were proposing the first line the 3.9
 
04:53:25.868 --> 04:53:25.878 align:start position:0%
million was in critical maintenance and
 
04:53:28.350 --> 04:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
safety followed by a
 
04:53:31.310 --> 04:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
2.7 million in infrastructure and I do
 
04:53:33.910 --> 04:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
believe shennon that we actually went
 
04:53:35.548 --> 04:53:35.558 align:start position:0%
back and we looked at this particular
 
04:53:37.628 --> 04:53:37.638 align:start position:0%
number and we have a a revision if you
 
04:53:39.230 --> 04:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
could talk about that for a moment
 
04:53:41.470 --> 04:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
please we do we have a downward Revision
 
04:53:44.070 --> 04:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
in in this request um when we initially
 
04:53:47.390 --> 04:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
filed submitted the form it was $2.75
 
04:53:49.548 --> 04:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
million in total in it infrastructure
 
04:53:51.990 --> 04:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
expenditures but we found within that
 
04:53:54.708 --> 04:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
some um some items that really weren't
 
04:53:57.948 --> 04:53:57.958 align:start position:0%
appropriate for Capital funding so those
 
04:53:59.670 --> 04:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
would those would be if we were able to
 
04:54:01.270 --> 04:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
do it we would need to fulfill that
 
04:54:02.750 --> 04:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
those needs from our operating budget so
 
04:54:05.190 --> 04:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
we've removed that which brings our new
 
04:54:08.110 --> 04:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
it request to
 
04:54:10.788 --> 04:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
2.25 million and we can we have a that
 
04:54:13.830 --> 04:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
is more specific to it but but right out
 
04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
of the gate that's a um
 
04:54:20.628 --> 04:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
$500,000 decrease in our request for
 
04:54:23.708 --> 04:54:23.718 align:start position:0%
it and the third line is about industry
 
04:54:26.510 --> 04:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
Pathways I had mentioned the uh NASA
 
04:54:29.470 --> 04:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
engineering project the other uh project
 
04:54:31.548 --> 04:54:31.558 align:start position:0%
that would be included in Industry
 
04:54:33.990 --> 04:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
Pathways is some remodeling and
 
04:54:36.190 --> 04:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
renovation at Manchester Community
 
04:54:38.670 --> 04:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
College basically to support
 
04:54:41.350 --> 04:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester's partnership with unhm and
 
04:54:42.590 --> 04:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
the Army
 
04:54:47.230 --> 04:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
project uh what is needed is some
 
04:54:50.830 --> 04:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
additional lab space so that uh the
 
04:54:52.910 --> 04:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
biology majors and the and the advanced
 
04:54:55.708 --> 04:54:55.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturing Majors can have the
 
04:54:58.830 --> 04:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to learn sort of the the
 
04:55:01.070 --> 04:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
cross-pollination between biology and
 
04:55:01.080 --> 04:55:02.548 align:start position:0%
cross-pollination between biology and
advanced

04:55:02.548 --> 04:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
advanced
 
04:55:05.948 --> 04:55:05.958 align:start position:0%
manufacturing um so I can talk more
 
04:55:07.548 --> 04:55:07.558 align:start position:0%
about that if you have questions in a
 
04:55:10.628 --> 04:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
moment the next project is the White
 
04:55:13.390 --> 04:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
Mountains expansion in Littleton we're
 
04:55:15.948 --> 04:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
very excited about this uh the
 
04:55:18.590 --> 04:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
possibility here because the college has
 
04:55:20.948 --> 04:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
been saving funds and because of some
 
04:55:22.548 --> 04:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
other property that they've had that
 
04:55:24.910 --> 04:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
they're able to sell we're purchasing a
 
04:55:27.190 --> 04:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
a building in Littleton and what we
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
would be asking you for is for help to
 
04:55:32.310 --> 04:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
move the very successful uh diesel
 
04:55:35.310 --> 04:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
program to Littleton again going back to
 
04:55:38.110 --> 04:55:38.120 align:start position:0%
when I was a president at Manchester
 
04:55:40.270 --> 04:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
lots of folks that are in the heavy
 
04:55:42.070 --> 04:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
equipment industry said well can't we
 
04:55:43.670 --> 04:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
bring that program to Manchester it
 
04:55:46.270 --> 04:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
would be more centralized for us and as
 
04:55:48.350 --> 04:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
community colleges we work together and
 
04:55:51.230 --> 04:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
my answer was we're not going to do this
 
04:55:53.230 --> 04:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
because it's a you know it's a key
 
04:55:56.390 --> 04:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
program for White Mountains but people
 
04:55:58.150 --> 04:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
were complaining about the fact that you
 
04:56:00.430 --> 04:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
know to get to Berlin is not as easy as
 
04:56:03.948 --> 04:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
if you can zip up uh 93 North and you
 
04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
can go to Littleton and
 
04:56:09.430 --> 04:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
so the project that we're proposing here
 
04:56:13.150 --> 04:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
is that you help us to add uh the diesel
 
04:56:15.628 --> 04:56:15.638 align:start position:0%
technology program to this new site
 
04:56:18.270 --> 04:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
which again I can speak about our final
 
04:56:23.030 --> 04:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
proposal is uh to renovate faram Hall at
 
04:56:25.670 --> 04:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
nhti this would be to convert the space
 
04:56:28.430 --> 04:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
to Fine Arts currently the college
 
04:56:31.548 --> 04:56:31.558 align:start position:0%
houses the program off site they are
 
04:56:33.670 --> 04:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
looking to bring it back onto the
 
04:56:36.190 --> 04:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
college campus the lease there is about
 
04:56:39.230 --> 04:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
100,000 a year so that's our whole
 
04:56:39.240 --> 04:56:40.750 align:start position:0%
100,000 a year so that's our whole
proposal

04:56:40.750 --> 04:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
04:56:43.030 --> 04:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to actually turn things
 
04:56:46.270 --> 04:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
over to Matt uh to speak uh in more
 
04:56:49.628 --> 04:56:49.638 align:start position:0%
specifics or to Scott uh Scott is um
 
04:56:52.590 --> 04:56:52.600 align:start position:0%
he's coming to us to this uh coo
 
04:56:54.868 --> 04:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
position from having been the Chief
 
04:56:57.150 --> 04:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer at White Mountain so
 
04:56:59.670 --> 04:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
we have two people who can speak in
 
04:57:01.548 --> 04:57:01.558 align:start position:0%
detail about the projects should you
 
04:57:05.510 --> 04:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
have any questions about them so thank
 
04:57:11.510 --> 04:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:15.070 --> 04:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
um why don't
 
04:57:18.430 --> 04:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
we talk about the critical maintenance
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
first if you could go back to that you
 
04:57:26.708 --> 04:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
have just one huge number um how would
 
04:57:29.110 --> 04:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
you break that out between Life
 
04:57:32.350 --> 04:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
Safety um roofs replacement of old
 
04:57:32.360 --> 04:57:33.350 align:start position:0%
Safety um roofs replacement of old
fixtures

04:57:33.350 --> 04:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
fixtures
 
04:57:33.360 --> 04:57:35.150 align:start position:0%
fixtures
[Music]

04:57:35.150 --> 04:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:57:38.590 --> 04:57:38.600 align:start position:0%
um if you don't get the whole 3.9
 
04:57:42.788 --> 04:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
million which will be a stretch sure we
 
04:57:44.470 --> 04:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
understand that it's certainly a
 
04:57:46.750 --> 04:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
challenging time and we are grateful for
 
04:57:49.070 --> 04:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
whatever it is you can send our way but
 
04:57:51.070 --> 04:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
Matt could you talk specifically about
 
04:57:53.310 --> 04:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
what's in that 3.9 what are we talking
 
04:57:57.510 --> 04:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
about there yeah um we're talking about
 
04:58:02.070 --> 04:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
um as as um representative Graham said
 
04:58:04.430 --> 04:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
some roofs I don't have it broke down
 
04:58:06.310 --> 04:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
the way you've talked about it I have it
 
04:58:08.948 --> 04:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
broke down by colleges and I'd be glad
 
04:58:12.590 --> 04:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
to do that if uh and uh I can get that
 
04:58:16.070 --> 04:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
to you uh representative Graham if you
 
04:58:18.830 --> 04:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
would please because I think that will
 
04:58:22.150 --> 04:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
be important to all the members of the
 
04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
committee when we begin our work
 
04:58:27.868 --> 04:58:27.878 align:start position:0%
sessions and executive session on hospit
 
04:58:31.830 --> 04:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
25 to at least be able to look at that
 
04:58:34.708 --> 04:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
and if we can give pieces it's better
 
04:58:38.230 --> 04:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
than giving you nothing yeah um do you
 
04:58:41.750 --> 04:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
have the um information did Public Works
 
04:58:48.990 --> 04:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:53.708 --> 04:58:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:56.590 --> 04:58:56.600 align:start position:0%
can we can we we'll we'll follow up with
 
04:58:59.868 --> 04:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
that yeah follow up yeah most of our try
 
04:59:00.830 --> 04:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
to pull
 
04:59:04.708 --> 04:59:04.718 align:start position:0%
out most of our requests are um rooftop
 
04:59:09.270 --> 04:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
units electrical units um you know and
 
04:59:14.708 --> 04:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
um there are some roofs but mostly um we
 
04:59:18.310 --> 04:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
um few years ago I had Consultants go
 
04:59:20.590 --> 04:59:20.600 align:start position:0%
through every one of our buildings and
 
04:59:23.150 --> 04:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
itemize every one of the pieces of
 
04:59:29.110 --> 04:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
equipment in the uh facilities and um
 
04:59:32.110 --> 04:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
these are the this request is the last
 
04:59:35.270 --> 04:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
of the zero to five years that the life
 
04:59:38.708 --> 04:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
expectancy of the units and with what
 
04:59:43.948 --> 04:59:43.958 align:start position:0%
I'll send you is is that um that list
 
04:59:46.708 --> 04:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
please do because I'm I'm trying to find
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
I I don't have and I may just not be
 
04:59:51.110 --> 04:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
able to have it in front of me at my
 
04:59:55.590 --> 04:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
house um but it's not in the the book
 
04:59:59.190 --> 04:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
that went to the governor okay that's
 
05:00:01.750 --> 05:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
fine I I just so you know that Bureau of
 
05:00:03.510 --> 05:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
Public Works reviewed it and they got
 
05:00:05.350 --> 05:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
back to me and they they thought it was
 
05:00:08.788 --> 05:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
excellent of how I was so descriptive in
 
05:00:14.110 --> 05:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
what um the um each project was was for
 
05:00:16.510 --> 05:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
and and why it was needed so I will pass
 
05:00:22.350 --> 05:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:25.788 --> 05:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
you would you like to go on to please
 
05:00:29.270 --> 05:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
other specific
 
05:00:33.510 --> 05:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh Scott do you think you can um
 
05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
describe a little bit more of our
 
05:00:38.788 --> 05:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
it elements it infrastructure and this
 
05:00:41.788 --> 05:00:41.798 align:start position:0%
these are these are for the kind of the
 
05:00:44.788 --> 05:00:44.798 align:start position:0%
central um Foundation it Foundation that
 
05:00:48.270 --> 05:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
supports all seven colleges we we we
 
05:00:52.470 --> 05:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
approach the it um the it function as
 
05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
one system not seven separate colleges
 
05:00:57.910 --> 05:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
so this investment is for Statewide
 
05:01:00.590 --> 05:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
impact go ahead Scott absolutely thank
 
05:01:04.708 --> 05:01:04.718 align:start position:0%
you shanon so in the new 2.25 Million
 
05:01:06.590 --> 05:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
number that Shannon had mentioned
 
05:01:08.990 --> 05:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
earlier we realistically have come down
 
05:01:12.670 --> 05:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
to 7 particular buckets you know four of
 
05:01:16.548 --> 05:01:16.558 align:start position:0%
the seven are at or beyond the end of
 
05:01:18.270 --> 05:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
their useful life and that accounts for
 
05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
75% of the $2.25 million and the items
 
05:01:24.310 --> 05:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
that you see on the screen that VPN
 
05:01:27.548 --> 05:01:27.558 align:start position:0%
upgrade are blade servers which are both
 
05:01:30.030 --> 05:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
beyond the end of their useful life
 
05:01:32.750 --> 05:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
moving our back a disaster recovery
 
05:01:35.230 --> 05:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
backup system which is currently housed
 
05:01:37.548 --> 05:01:37.558 align:start position:0%
we have a redundant copy in conquered
 
05:01:39.948 --> 05:01:39.958 align:start position:0%
and also one in Durham at the University
 
05:01:42.430 --> 05:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire but really moving that
 
05:01:45.868 --> 05:01:45.878 align:start position:0%
into a cloud-based form uh primarily
 
05:01:49.948 --> 05:01:49.958 align:start position:0%
because while our copy at UNH is on a
 
05:01:52.030 --> 05:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
different utility Network should
 
05:01:54.830 --> 05:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
something happened in the conquered area
 
05:01:57.230 --> 05:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
cost Effectiveness is really driving
 
05:01:59.910 --> 05:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
people to move towards the cloud so that
 
05:02:01.070 --> 05:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that we have in here
 
05:02:02.750 --> 05:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
for this cloud-based disaster recovery
 
05:02:05.390 --> 05:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
system would essentially allow us to
 
05:02:08.548 --> 05:02:08.558 align:start position:0%
reduce costs longterm and provide an
 
05:02:10.910 --> 05:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
additional spot of redundancy to ensure
 
05:02:12.788 --> 05:02:12.798 align:start position:0%
that our data is kept safe and sound
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
should something happen our load
 
05:02:18.628 --> 05:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
balancers are a key component of our
 
05:02:21.390 --> 05:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
internet traffic system if you will they
 
05:02:23.430 --> 05:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
are kind of buffers on the front end and
 
05:02:25.310 --> 05:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
the back end of the way that data flows
 
05:02:28.190 --> 05:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
through our sites and what these systems
 
05:02:32.548 --> 05:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
do is it allows for it certificates and
 
05:02:34.310 --> 05:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
things that are more technically beyond
 
05:02:35.788 --> 05:02:35.798 align:start position:0%
my ability to share with you right now
 
05:02:38.350 --> 05:02:38.360 align:start position:0%
but it allows for the traffic to be
 
05:02:40.350 --> 05:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
monitored and controlled as it it flows
 
05:02:43.510 --> 05:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
through our infrastructure so it doesn't
 
05:02:46.110 --> 05:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
bog down on the back end these units are
 
05:02:48.310 --> 05:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
actually housed in Durham at the
 
05:02:50.430 --> 05:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire and are at
 
05:02:52.150 --> 05:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
their useful the end of their useful
 
05:02:55.590 --> 05:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
life as well um we have a project with
 
05:02:57.470 --> 05:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
the UPS units that Shannon has on the
 
05:02:59.350 --> 05:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
slide here essentially what we're trying
 
05:03:01.590 --> 05:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
to do is provide another insurance
 
05:03:03.190 --> 05:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
policy for a lot of our technology
 
05:03:05.590 --> 05:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
closets at all of our college campuses
 
05:03:07.910 --> 05:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
and academic centers essentially what's
 
05:03:09.788 --> 05:03:09.798 align:start position:0%
happening is we have key in uh resour
 
05:03:12.590 --> 05:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
forces in these Tech closets that are
 
05:03:15.190 --> 05:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
either on UPS systems which are
 
05:03:17.350 --> 05:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
essentially battery operated generators
 
05:03:19.910 --> 05:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
that will kick in should we lose power
 
05:03:21.628 --> 05:03:21.638 align:start position:0%
or there's a surge and acts as a
 
05:03:22.990 --> 05:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
protector for that
 
05:03:25.230 --> 05:03:25.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure what's there is it's
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
either missing or outdated or the amount
 
05:03:30.830 --> 05:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
of hours left in the battery if you will
 
05:03:32.430 --> 05:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
it's uh when you go to get a flashlight
 
05:03:33.868 --> 05:03:33.878 align:start position:0%
in a hurricane and the your batteries
 
05:03:34.868 --> 05:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
have been in there for three or four
 
05:03:37.230 --> 05:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
years it doesn't work very well so what
 
05:03:39.070 --> 05:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
this essentially this project is doing
 
05:03:41.910 --> 05:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
is it has aot in us to again ensure
 
05:03:44.990 --> 05:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
these it closets and the servers and
 
05:03:46.628 --> 05:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
monitors and everything that's in that
 
05:03:49.670 --> 05:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure area to be safe in times
 
05:03:52.470 --> 05:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
of again power surges or prolonged
 
05:03:54.310 --> 05:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
outages to ensure that there's heat in
 
05:03:55.628 --> 05:03:55.638 align:start position:0%
the room air conditioning in the room
 
05:03:56.750 --> 05:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
things of that
 
05:03:59.628 --> 05:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
nature um our alls sites ticketing
 
05:04:02.910 --> 05:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
system essentially what ccsnh does is we
 
05:04:06.270 --> 05:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
have one help desk that is for Hardware
 
05:04:08.868 --> 05:04:08.878 align:start position:0%
software facilities and what we're
 
05:04:11.548 --> 05:04:11.558 align:start position:0%
trying to do is the system that we have
 
05:04:13.230 --> 05:04:13.240 align:start position:0%
is is somewhat on the older side
 
05:04:14.750 --> 05:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
Antiquated and we'd like to be able to
 
05:04:16.708 --> 05:04:16.718 align:start position:0%
bring it in so we can actually start
 
05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
tracking things that would be useful to
 
05:04:21.230 --> 05:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
know in this particular conversation in
 
05:04:23.868 --> 05:04:23.878 align:start position:0%
that things that Matt deals with with
 
05:04:26.948 --> 05:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
rooftop units boilers we will be able to
 
05:04:29.310 --> 05:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
track uh once we get the system set up
 
05:04:30.990 --> 05:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
and in place we'll be able to use some
 
05:04:32.590 --> 05:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
functionality to track how much we're
 
05:04:35.548 --> 05:04:35.558 align:start position:0%
spending per unit on repair costs so
 
05:04:37.948 --> 05:04:37.958 align:start position:0%
we'll know if it's if a unit is needs to
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
be replaced because we've spent so much
 
05:04:42.868 --> 05:04:42.878 align:start position:0%
on it or if there's a an ongoing issue
 
05:04:44.670 --> 05:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
in a specific college so maybe it's a
 
05:04:46.548 --> 05:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
wiring issue we need to take control of
 
05:04:49.110 --> 05:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
so having that system implemented so all
 
05:04:51.470 --> 05:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
seven schools and the academic centers
 
05:04:53.270 --> 05:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
can be on one platform so it's
 
05:04:55.548 --> 05:04:55.558 align:start position:0%
centralized we can monitor the tickets
 
05:04:58.350 --> 05:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
we can track the expenses would be a a
 
05:04:59.910 --> 05:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
definite benefit from us on an
 
05:05:01.830 --> 05:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
administrative side it would also get us
 
05:05:03.510 --> 05:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
out in front of ensuring that we don't
 
05:05:06.590 --> 05:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
have any uh mechanical issues or
 
05:05:08.948 --> 05:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
computer issues that are just we're not
 
05:05:10.670 --> 05:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
seeing because we can't quantify it in
 
05:05:13.470 --> 05:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
one particular area and finally our our
 
05:05:15.430 --> 05:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
voice system this is something that has
 
05:05:17.310 --> 05:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
been uh part of the request at least
 
05:05:19.788 --> 05:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
internally for a while and it's it's
 
05:05:22.110 --> 05:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
been pushed off but this system itself
 
05:05:24.310 --> 05:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
is at the end of its useful life we are
 
05:05:28.070 --> 05:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
tied to one particular uh vendor in this
 
05:05:30.110 --> 05:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
component with the usage that we have so
 
05:05:31.750 --> 05:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
what we'd like to do is to be able to go
 
05:05:34.470 --> 05:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
out get into a new system that would not
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
tie us to any one particular vendor that
 
05:05:39.910 --> 05:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
would allow us to really use use our
 
05:05:41.590 --> 05:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
economy es scale and pull some levers to
 
05:05:43.670 --> 05:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
try and find some savings on the actual
 
05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
data usage on that
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:57.190 --> 05:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
Abbott yes thank you Mr chairman I just
 
05:06:00.628 --> 05:06:00.638 align:start position:0%
wondered if you folks had been in
 
05:06:03.590 --> 05:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
communication or consultation with the
 
05:06:06.190 --> 05:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology
 
05:06:10.310 --> 05:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
regarding these requests
 
05:06:11.948 --> 05:06:11.958 align:start position:0%
not the time oh I'm sorry Shon not in
 
05:06:13.150 --> 05:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
the time that I've been here but there
 
05:06:14.708 --> 05:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
might have been prior conversations
 
05:06:16.990 --> 05:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
because this budget was produced before
 
05:06:19.788 --> 05:06:19.798 align:start position:0%
my arrival in this R so Shannon yeah so
 
05:06:22.070 --> 05:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
this year we haven't in past years um
 
05:06:25.030 --> 05:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
doit has sat in on the governor's budget
 
05:06:27.510 --> 05:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
panel hearings which happened back in
 
05:06:30.430 --> 05:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
the summer um so they have a a lens on
 
05:06:32.470 --> 05:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
it at that point and in the past
 
05:06:34.350 --> 05:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
occasionally from time of time they've
 
05:06:36.110 --> 05:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
had specific follow-up questions for us
 
05:06:38.830 --> 05:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
they haven't this this year our it
 
05:06:40.190 --> 05:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
environment is really
 
05:06:43.830 --> 05:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
not related to the states in any way um
 
05:06:46.310 --> 05:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
so you know if if the oit has has
 
05:06:48.670 --> 05:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
specific questions or recommendations or
 
05:06:50.708 --> 05:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
anything that they wish to follow up on
 
05:06:52.590 --> 05:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
uh in the past they've they have
 
05:06:54.150 --> 05:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
connected with us that hasn't happened
 
05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
so far this
 
05:06:57.990 --> 05:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
cycle okay thank
 
05:07:04.230 --> 05:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
you Chancellor on this item as well um
 
05:07:07.190 --> 05:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
you've got several items that we just
 
05:07:10.750 --> 05:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
discussed but no dollar amounts to any
 
05:07:14.510 --> 05:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
of them other than a total um I'm
 
05:07:16.628 --> 05:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
assuming that the way they're listed are
 
05:07:19.510 --> 05:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
your priorities but it would be helpful
 
05:07:22.548 --> 05:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
for committee discussions if there was a
 
05:07:25.190 --> 05:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
dollar amount against each of those as
 
05:07:26.708 --> 05:07:26.718 align:start position:0%
we go
 
05:07:28.990 --> 05:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
forward we we will send that to you
 
05:07:33.628 --> 05:07:33.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:37.430 --> 05:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
you our next um next request was the
 
05:07:39.830 --> 05:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
industry pathway lab Renovations and
 
05:07:41.628 --> 05:07:41.638 align:start position:0%
this is what has been included in the
 
05:07:44.230 --> 05:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
governor's budget partially the amount
 
05:07:45.948 --> 05:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
that was earmarked in the last capital
 
05:07:48.830 --> 05:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
budget as phase two of the Nashville
 
05:07:51.110 --> 05:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
Community College project that the
 
05:07:54.548 --> 05:07:54.558 align:start position:0%
capital budget started to fund um two
 
05:07:57.590 --> 05:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
years ago so so that the first part the
 
05:07:59.590 --> 05:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
top of this slide is funded the second
 
05:08:01.150 --> 05:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
part which is Manchester Community
 
05:08:04.190 --> 05:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
College science labs is not presently in
 
05:08:05.990 --> 05:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget so if you have any
 
05:08:07.590 --> 05:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
questions about that actually Susan is
 
05:08:10.350 --> 05:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
is best suited to answer them she she
 
05:08:18.868 --> 05:08:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:20.990 --> 05:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
well Susan is there
 
05:08:22.948 --> 05:08:22.958 align:start position:0%
anything else that you want to say about
 
05:08:22.958 --> 05:08:23.868 align:start position:0%
anything else that you want to say about
that

05:08:23.868 --> 05:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:08:23.878 --> 05:08:25.430 align:start position:0%
that
project

05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:08:28.788 --> 05:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
um I I would say that it the Armory
 
05:08:30.310 --> 05:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
project has been underway for a couple
 
05:08:32.990 --> 05:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
of years now and one of the needs that
 
05:08:34.788 --> 05:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
they've noted is the need for
 
05:08:38.150 --> 05:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
technicians however until very recently
 
05:08:40.350 --> 05:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
um it was was primarily about the
 
05:08:41.990 --> 05:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
research side of things and when we
 
05:08:43.310 --> 05:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
would ask well what do you need for
 
05:08:45.150 --> 05:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
technicians because that is the middle
 
05:08:47.708 --> 05:08:47.718 align:start position:0%
scale level that Manchester in
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
particular serves they didn't know what
 
05:08:52.190 --> 05:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
they needed it's been a fairly recent
 
05:08:54.030 --> 05:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
discussion where they have started to
 
05:08:56.070 --> 05:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
identify the skill set that the
 
05:08:58.510 --> 05:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
technicians will need to work in the
 
05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
labs that Army is
 
05:09:06.150 --> 05:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
proposing um Chancellor on that as far
 
05:09:09.548 --> 05:09:09.558 align:start position:0%
as equipping the the lab have we talked
 
05:09:13.628 --> 05:09:13.638 align:start position:0%
Army and and uh the investors about
 
05:09:16.510 --> 05:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
helping to fund the equipment that needs
 
05:09:18.948 --> 05:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
to go into it I know we've done it for
 
05:09:21.390 --> 05:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
you know Diesel and automotive and
 
05:09:24.910 --> 05:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
dental and all the rest hopefully we can
 
05:09:28.708 --> 05:09:28.718 align:start position:0%
leverage some money from them for um the
 
05:09:31.070 --> 05:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
equipment and other things needed Within
 
05:09:31.080 --> 05:09:31.868 align:start position:0%
equipment and other things needed Within
These

05:09:31.868 --> 05:09:31.878 align:start position:0%
These
 
05:09:36.190 --> 05:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
Labs um yes there the in fact there are
 
05:09:38.510 --> 05:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
two faculty members from Manchester one
 
05:09:40.310 --> 05:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
from the biology area and one from the
 
05:09:44.310 --> 05:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
robotics area that sit on the um the
 
05:09:46.750 --> 05:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
educator uh groups that are connected
 
05:09:48.990 --> 05:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
with army and are are well connected I
 
05:09:51.708 --> 05:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
would say that the project here is is
 
05:09:55.390 --> 05:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
actually about um taking over the prep
 
05:09:59.230 --> 05:09:59.240 align:start position:0%
rooms that exist in um at least three of
 
05:10:01.548 --> 05:10:01.558 align:start position:0%
the rooms and essentially turning them
 
05:10:04.310 --> 05:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
into lab space so there's not a it's not
 
05:10:06.868 --> 05:10:06.878 align:start position:0%
so much about equipment as it is about
 
05:10:10.548 --> 05:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
constructing the space so that um things
 
05:10:12.430 --> 05:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
can happen there there's also a very
 
05:10:15.510 --> 05:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
strong connection between the faculty at
 
05:10:20.310 --> 05:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
unhm and Manchester and um in in
 
05:10:22.590 --> 05:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
speaking in in having the two faculties
 
05:10:24.830 --> 05:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
speak what we discovered was that what
 
05:10:26.990 --> 05:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester needed to do for the students
 
05:10:29.990 --> 05:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
was teach them the very basic lab skills
 
05:10:31.990 --> 05:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
again is not going to require a
 
05:10:34.030 --> 05:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of equipment and then
 
05:10:35.948 --> 05:10:35.958 align:start position:0%
there's an arrangement so that even
 
05:10:38.190 --> 05:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
while there's students at MCC the
 
05:10:41.830 --> 05:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
students can go to hm and do the biotech
 
05:10:44.548 --> 05:10:44.558 align:start position:0%
work there but this is a a connection
 
05:10:47.110 --> 05:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
the other piece of it besides the Army
 
05:10:49.830 --> 05:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
part is that there's one physics lab and
 
05:10:53.230 --> 05:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
as the college has expanded into the uh
 
05:10:56.390 --> 05:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
more into the electrical area um the the
 
05:10:58.670 --> 05:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
one lab is on the smaller side of things
 
05:11:01.830 --> 05:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
and again there it is also taking over
 
05:11:04.150 --> 05:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
space and expanding the size of the lab
 
05:11:06.990 --> 05:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
so again not much about equipment more
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
about um opening up the space is and
 
05:11:13.350 --> 05:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
making it so that um you know equipment
 
05:11:14.990 --> 05:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
in the case of the physics lab that I'm
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
discussing can be shifted in and out
 
05:11:18.628 --> 05:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
depending upon whether we're talking
 
05:11:21.788 --> 05:11:21.798 align:start position:0%
about um University Physics or we're
 
05:11:24.910 --> 05:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
talking about environmental
 
05:11:28.548 --> 05:11:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:30.548 --> 05:11:30.558 align:start position:0%
you if there are no other questions I'll
 
05:11:30.558 --> 05:11:31.430 align:start position:0%
you if there are no other questions I'll
move

05:11:31.430 --> 05:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
move
 
05:11:34.830 --> 05:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
on we can of course come back to any of
 
05:11:37.470 --> 05:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
this is the Littleton expansion um this
 
05:11:39.990 --> 05:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
this the idea of expanding White
 
05:11:42.270 --> 05:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
Mountains Community College uh offerings
 
05:11:44.190 --> 05:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
in Littleton you know basically the
 
05:11:47.390 --> 05:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
western part of Northern New Hampshire
 
05:11:48.470 --> 05:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
um something that we've been talking
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
about for several years now and had a
 
05:11:52.788 --> 05:11:52.798 align:start position:0%
variety of different kind of
 
05:11:56.070 --> 05:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
possibilities um across our our planning
 
05:11:58.830 --> 05:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
path and have found one that we think is
 
05:12:02.548 --> 05:12:02.558 align:start position:0%
is really very strong and that is to um
 
05:12:04.030 --> 05:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
purchase the site in Littleton that we
 
05:12:05.310 --> 05:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
presently lease and that's something
 
05:12:08.670 --> 05:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
that that is underway and and then to
 
05:12:11.390 --> 05:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
subsequent renovate it and expand it uh
 
05:12:13.708 --> 05:12:13.718 align:start position:0%
as Susan mentioned one of the primary
 
05:12:15.270 --> 05:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
goals of this would be to bring the
 
05:12:19.070 --> 05:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
mobile diesel um program into Littleton
 
05:12:20.868 --> 05:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
from Berlin much more convenient for
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
industry sitting at the top of 93 um
 
05:12:26.990 --> 05:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
that program draws um not just from the
 
05:12:28.230 --> 05:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
North country but really from all over
 
05:12:30.390 --> 05:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
the state in terms of students and from
 
05:12:31.990 --> 05:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
all over the region in terms of business
 
05:12:34.070 --> 05:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
partners um very strong and important
 
05:12:35.230 --> 05:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
program for White Mountains Community
 
05:12:36.948 --> 05:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
College if you have any other specific
 
05:12:39.510 --> 05:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
questions um Scott or Susan or I can can
 
05:12:44.990 --> 05:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:47.390 --> 05:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
mat um seeing
 
05:12:53.948 --> 05:12:53.958 align:start position:0%
none has this idea been broached to
 
05:12:58.030 --> 05:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
um the like mayor of Berlin and and
 
05:13:01.990 --> 05:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
others that know that this may be in uh
 
05:13:02.000 --> 05:13:02.830 align:start position:0%
others that know that this may be in uh
the

05:13:02.830 --> 05:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:13:04.948 --> 05:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
future yes there there have been
 
05:13:07.788 --> 05:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
extensive conversations between
 
05:13:10.190 --> 05:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
President Lloyd and and the mayor of
 
05:13:13.270 --> 05:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
Berlin we're very sensitive to what's
 
05:13:16.150 --> 05:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
happening in Berlin and um president
 
05:13:17.830 --> 05:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
Lloyd has made it very clear that we're
 
05:13:20.830 --> 05:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
not looking to move out of Berlin the
 
05:13:23.548 --> 05:13:23.558 align:start position:0%
issue with the mobile diesel program is
 
05:13:25.830 --> 05:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
that it's a program that requires a
 
05:13:29.910 --> 05:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
particular accrediation and um by moving
 
05:13:32.910 --> 05:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
it to this new site or to the Littleton
 
05:13:34.708 --> 05:13:34.718 align:start position:0%
site we have more
 
05:13:37.190 --> 05:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities at the same time uh the
 
05:13:40.150 --> 05:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
major uh program of study at the Berlin
 
05:13:41.750 --> 05:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
site is in the healthc care side of
 
05:13:44.670 --> 05:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
things and actually by improving some of
 
05:13:47.190 --> 05:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
the spaces in Littleton we'll be able to
 
05:13:50.150 --> 05:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
get more people started on Health Care
 
05:13:51.590 --> 05:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
Pathways but then they would go to
 
05:13:54.990 --> 05:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
Berlin so this seems to be um a program
 
05:13:58.350 --> 05:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
that appeals to both the mayor of Berlin
 
05:14:00.708 --> 05:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
and the head official in Littleton as
 
05:14:04.350 --> 05:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
well and Scott can verify but we've had
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
conversations going on for a couple of
 
05:14:09.150 --> 05:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
years with both entities because we want
 
05:14:12.708 --> 05:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
to uh keep both towns happy
 
05:14:15.070 --> 05:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
frankly that is correct there have been
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
constant Communications uh from
 
05:14:19.750 --> 05:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
president Lloyd uh the the business
 
05:14:21.030 --> 05:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
community in Littleton is looking
 
05:14:22.830 --> 05:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
forward to the possibility of this
 
05:14:24.548 --> 05:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
coming to fruition and and again as
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
Chancellor H just mentioned we've
 
05:14:30.670 --> 05:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
ensured that the the city of Berlin is
 
05:14:32.470 --> 05:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
not going to be left an alert and by
 
05:14:35.030 --> 05:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
having this synergistic relationship
 
05:14:36.590 --> 05:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
between Littleton and Berlin there will
 
05:14:39.510 --> 05:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
be additional students flowing into
 
05:14:41.310 --> 05:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
the city of Berlin at the
 
05:14:43.510 --> 05:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
college thank you representative
 
05:14:50.030 --> 05:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.430 --> 05:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
question I did and and basically it's
 
05:14:56.350 --> 05:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
been answered but I guess my question
 
05:14:58.708 --> 05:14:58.718 align:start position:0%
was how many diesel students do you have
 
05:15:01.990 --> 05:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
in the Berlin operation currently with a
 
05:15:05.830 --> 05:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
followup it's in the mid
 
05:15:08.310 --> 05:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
20s and how many do you anticipate
 
05:15:09.788 --> 05:15:09.798 align:start position:0%
you're going to get if you move this
 
05:15:12.590 --> 05:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
operation to Littleton
 
05:15:15.990 --> 05:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
so part of the uh the expansion of the
 
05:15:18.150 --> 05:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
program in Littleton is a 10,000 squ
 
05:15:21.910 --> 05:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
foot facility that we're looking at uh
 
05:15:24.150 --> 05:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
that would increase the size of the
 
05:15:27.230 --> 05:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
current location in Berlin by roughly
 
05:15:30.868 --> 05:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
2,000 square feet but it would be able
 
05:15:33.590 --> 05:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
to be modular in its nature and what I
 
05:15:35.750 --> 05:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
mean by that is nothing is going to be
 
05:15:37.910 --> 05:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
permanently a a fixed to certain station
 
05:15:39.590 --> 05:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
so they'll have the mo the ability to
 
05:15:41.510 --> 05:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
change the modality of the space that
 
05:15:43.830 --> 05:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
will allow for more students as well as
 
05:15:46.150 --> 05:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
different programming during offseason
 
05:15:50.510 --> 05:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
times of the year so I I I can off the
 
05:15:52.830 --> 05:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
top of my head I could see the program
 
05:15:56.150 --> 05:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
growing by 20% but I don't have that
 
05:15:57.548 --> 05:15:57.558 align:start position:0%
number off the top of my head and I
 
05:15:59.190 --> 05:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
could confirm with President Lloyd what
 
05:16:02.470 --> 05:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:05.628 --> 05:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
that I will also add uh representative
 
05:16:08.910 --> 05:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
Graham that um the proposal to move the
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
mobile diesel program is being uh
 
05:16:15.948 --> 05:16:15.958 align:start position:0%
heavily supported by Milton cat um they
 
05:16:19.030 --> 05:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
in fact uh lent us the expertise the
 
05:16:21.190 --> 05:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
company that builds all of their sites
 
05:16:23.990 --> 05:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
across the United States in fact has
 
05:16:26.030 --> 05:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
looked at the littlton site and has
 
05:16:28.990 --> 05:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
advised us as to what we would need uh
 
05:16:31.590 --> 05:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
to construct just to indicate the the
 
05:16:35.310 --> 05:16:35.320 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm of the diesel Community you
 
05:16:37.470 --> 05:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
had a followup representative
 
05:16:42.070 --> 05:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
Thompson yeah I just um $4.2
 
05:16:44.510 --> 05:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
million seems like a lot of money to
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
increase your student ratio by
 
05:16:51.070 --> 05:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
20% it's just my opinion but I
 
05:16:52.788 --> 05:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
05:16:55.510 --> 05:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
aners representative
 
05:16:58.310 --> 05:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
Abbott yes thank you Mr chairman I just
 
05:17:01.430 --> 05:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
wondered if any thought was given to
 
05:17:05.230 --> 05:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
with the diesel portion of the program
 
05:17:09.270 --> 05:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
um to putting one in River Valley
 
05:17:12.590 --> 05:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
Community College in
 
05:17:16.270 --> 05:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
Claremont is it seems that uh I have a
 
05:17:19.788 --> 05:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
lot of complaints from constituents
 
05:17:24.150 --> 05:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
about um that not having a CDL program
 
05:17:26.990 --> 05:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
available to in the western portion of
 
05:17:27.000 --> 05:17:29.510 align:start position:0%
available to in the western portion of
the

05:17:29.510 --> 05:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:32.948 --> 05:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
state um as far as I know representative
 
05:17:35.270 --> 05:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been a conversation about
 
05:17:36.910 --> 05:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
that but that doesn't mean that we
 
05:17:39.910 --> 05:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
cannot have one so
 
05:17:43.910 --> 05:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
um while the CDL program does exist at
 
05:17:46.070 --> 05:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
this moment at White Mountains there had
 
05:17:48.590 --> 05:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
been one at Lakes
 
05:17:53.310 --> 05:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
Region um and we're following a a newer
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
model in the community college system
 
05:17:56.788 --> 05:17:56.798 align:start position:0%
where we're trying to
 
05:17:58.948 --> 05:17:58.958 align:start position:0%
identify I'll call it a center for
 
05:18:01.470 --> 05:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
excellence so actually to speak about
 
05:18:05.150 --> 05:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
River Valley um River Valley is the
 
05:18:08.788 --> 05:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
place where we um restarted the LPN
 
05:18:11.830 --> 05:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
program licensed practical nursing and
 
05:18:14.230 --> 05:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
at this point it has expanded this
 
05:18:16.470 --> 05:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
semester to Lakes Region Community
 
05:18:20.628 --> 05:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
College and it is uh under discussion to
 
05:18:22.868 --> 05:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
expand it to White Mountains Community
 
05:18:25.990 --> 05:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
College so I see no reason why we
 
05:18:29.390 --> 05:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply that same model to the
 
05:18:35.070 --> 05:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
CDL um and um I'd like to go back to uh
 
05:18:37.110 --> 05:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative Thompson's question for a
 
05:18:38.830 --> 05:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
moment I agree with you that if we're
 
05:18:41.788 --> 05:18:41.798 align:start position:0%
going to be building uh spending 4.2
 
05:18:44.070 --> 05:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
million that 20% does not sound like
 
05:18:46.150 --> 05:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
very much I believe Mr Fields is
 
05:18:49.628 --> 05:18:49.638 align:start position:0%
referring to the degree program and and
 
05:18:52.150 --> 05:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
what we are also talking about here when
 
05:18:55.270 --> 05:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
we talk about CDL is a non-credit
 
05:18:59.230 --> 05:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
certificate and so we see uh an increase
 
05:19:02.310 --> 05:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
in short-term certificates and now back
 
05:19:05.150 --> 05:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
to representative Abbott you know having
 
05:19:07.510 --> 05:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
the CDL program operating from one side
 
05:19:09.030 --> 05:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
and spreading to another side side is
 
05:19:14.350 --> 05:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:16.430 --> 05:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
consider I would just add that the
 
05:19:19.190 --> 05:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
Litton project encompasses more than
 
05:19:22.910 --> 05:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
mobile diesel program more than CDL um
 
05:19:26.190 --> 05:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
the the objective for that um project is
 
05:19:28.830 --> 05:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
also to be able to expand in the array
 
05:19:30.350 --> 05:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
of program offerings that we currently
 
05:19:31.788 --> 05:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
offer in Littleton and you can see those
 
05:19:33.708 --> 05:19:33.718 align:start position:0%
in the the final bullet on this on this
 
05:19:35.190 --> 05:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
slide so those those
 
05:19:37.390 --> 05:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
include I I won't read the slide to you
 
05:19:39.910 --> 05:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
but it includes a a lot of of additional
 
05:19:41.470 --> 05:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
programming in the business field the
 
05:19:44.548 --> 05:19:44.558 align:start position:0%
healthcare field um general education
 
05:19:46.470 --> 05:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
that students in that in that region
 
05:19:49.750 --> 05:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:53.070 --> 05:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
of I may just a followup to Shannon's
 
05:19:55.150 --> 05:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
comment another programming option that
 
05:19:56.948 --> 05:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
we're looking at in Littleton has to do
 
05:19:59.350 --> 05:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
with electric vehicles
 
05:20:02.430 --> 05:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
wmcc has actually just received a grant
 
05:20:05.390 --> 05:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
from a Canadian uh company to start
 
05:20:07.590 --> 05:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
exploring what that would look like so
 
05:20:09.868 --> 05:20:09.878 align:start position:0%
when I was referring to the
 
05:20:12.788 --> 05:20:12.798 align:start position:0%
the modular functionality of the space
 
05:20:14.990 --> 05:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
we're able to use the space to bring in
 
05:20:17.230 --> 05:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
other programs like electric vehicles
 
05:20:19.430 --> 05:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature to expand
 
05:20:21.150 --> 05:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
short-term certificates and possibly
 
05:20:23.548 --> 05:20:23.558 align:start position:0%
degree programs down the road but we've
 
05:20:25.470 --> 05:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
just received that seed money to start
 
05:20:30.910 --> 05:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:35.910 --> 05:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
well shall I move on moving on okay the
 
05:20:38.430 --> 05:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
final element of our request uh again is
 
05:20:40.350 --> 05:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
uh renovation of farum Hall it's on the
 
05:20:43.110 --> 05:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
nhci campus we presently have about 500
 
05:20:47.230 --> 05:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
students who take courses at a least um
 
05:20:49.350 --> 05:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
least space a few miles away it's up
 
05:20:51.510 --> 05:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
near the prison in conquer um these are
 
05:20:53.628 --> 05:20:53.638 align:start position:0%
students who are primarily taking Fine
 
05:20:55.548 --> 05:20:55.558 align:start position:0%
Arts courses but they those courses
 
05:20:58.750 --> 05:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
serve a wide variety of Majors so things
 
05:21:01.470 --> 05:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
like um architectural technology our
 
05:21:03.868 --> 05:21:03.878 align:start position:0%
digital gaming technology some of the
 
05:21:05.350 --> 05:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturing programs that really
 
05:21:08.230 --> 05:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
require sort of a graphic orientation or
 
05:21:12.110 --> 05:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
graphic orientation so this this project
 
05:21:14.470 --> 05:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
would would allow us to renovate a
 
05:21:17.150 --> 05:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
building on the nhdi campus move all of
 
05:21:18.948 --> 05:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
those students back to campus which
 
05:21:20.948 --> 05:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
would help us a lot and help them a lot
 
05:21:23.110 --> 05:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of scheduling and then just the
 
05:21:24.788 --> 05:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
convenience of being on a campus instead
 
05:21:27.030 --> 05:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
of a remote location um and it would
 
05:21:29.590 --> 05:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
also enable us to reconfigure that space
 
05:21:31.470 --> 05:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
to meet emerging program needs because
 
05:21:33.548 --> 05:21:33.558 align:start position:0%
as the college looks forward you know
 
05:21:35.310 --> 05:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
there are going to be new things that
 
05:21:36.470 --> 05:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
that are on the horizon that it will
 
05:21:39.548 --> 05:21:39.558 align:start position:0%
need to offer and um this space is
 
05:21:41.948 --> 05:21:41.958 align:start position:0%
really where those emerging needs could
 
05:21:41.958 --> 05:21:46.150 align:start position:0%
really where those emerging needs could
be

05:21:46.150 --> 05:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:48.670 --> 05:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
met and we can again go back to any of
 
05:21:51.110 --> 05:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
this if there's questions but we wanted
 
05:21:54.670 --> 05:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
to just kind of show you the array of
 
05:21:56.708 --> 05:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
Industry partners that we work with and
 
05:21:59.190 --> 05:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
these are current or and or recent
 
05:22:02.390 --> 05:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
Partners these two slides um you can see
 
05:22:04.110 --> 05:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
all across the state you can see a
 
05:22:06.030 --> 05:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
variety of different types of training
 
05:22:08.750 --> 05:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
relationships that we have from very
 
05:22:12.470 --> 05:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
technical um and high-tech types of
 
05:22:15.310 --> 05:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
training to uh more sort of business
 
05:22:17.510 --> 05:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
leadership oriented training Human
 
05:22:20.948 --> 05:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
Services Health Care um we we really one
 
05:22:22.190 --> 05:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
of the strengths of the community
 
05:22:24.750 --> 05:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
college system as I'm sure you know is
 
05:22:27.868 --> 05:22:27.878 align:start position:0%
that we are very well able to respond to
 
05:22:29.670 --> 05:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
to needs and opportunities from a
 
05:22:31.510 --> 05:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
variety of types of employers across the
 
05:22:33.948 --> 05:22:33.958 align:start position:0%
state and really provide those uh career
 
05:22:36.270 --> 05:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
those education and career Pathways for
 
05:22:39.150 --> 05:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
our our local New Hampshire learners so
 
05:22:41.830 --> 05:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
that I believe is everything we have
 
05:22:42.910 --> 05:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
brought we're happy to go back and
 
05:22:45.788 --> 05:22:45.798 align:start position:0%
revisit any of these topics or projects
 
05:22:47.548 --> 05:22:47.558 align:start position:0%
as you would
 
05:22:47.558 --> 05:22:49.150 align:start position:0%
as you would
like

05:22:49.150 --> 05:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:22:52.788 --> 05:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
um well I'd like to make a warm welcome
 
05:22:54.910 --> 05:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
to the former chairman of Public Works
 
05:22:58.990 --> 05:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
at highways who's also on here um before
 
05:23:03.230 --> 05:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
I open up to questions and welcome Ed
 
05:23:05.948 --> 05:23:05.958 align:start position:0%
welcome back to public works good
 
05:23:07.708 --> 05:23:07.718 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chairman and thank you very
 
05:23:10.510 --> 05:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
much this this is interesting I wondered
 
05:23:13.430 --> 05:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
how these Zoom
 
05:23:16.150 --> 05:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
or under the how the hearings would go
 
05:23:18.110 --> 05:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
under this format it's interesting to
 
05:23:21.670 --> 05:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
hear it and I I don't envy you at all
 
05:23:23.990 --> 05:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
you're doing a good job but keep it up
 
05:23:27.270 --> 05:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
guys you taught me most of what I
 
05:23:30.948 --> 05:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
do what's that you taught me most of
 
05:23:32.750 --> 05:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
what I know about doing
 
05:23:34.948 --> 05:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
this you were a good student if I
 
05:23:34.958 --> 05:23:35.830 align:start position:0%
this you were a good student if I
remember

05:23:35.830 --> 05:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
remember
 
05:23:39.150 --> 05:23:39.160 align:start position:0%
correctly all right enough
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative evil for a
 
05:23:44.830 --> 05:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you and thank you
 
05:23:47.990 --> 05:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
very much for uh being here today folks
 
05:23:50.708 --> 05:23:50.718 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you um this is kind of
 
05:23:52.788 --> 05:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
hard I don't I don't quite know how to
 
05:23:54.670 --> 05:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
pose the question but of course there's
 
05:23:57.830 --> 05:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh discussion around whether
 
05:24:01.310 --> 05:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
the university system and the um and the
 
05:24:04.470 --> 05:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
community college system are going to be
 
05:24:07.070 --> 05:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
merged anything you want to say about
 
05:24:09.350 --> 05:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
that as relates to the capital budget
 
05:24:12.670 --> 05:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
looking ahead I mean I would assume that
 
05:24:15.310 --> 05:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of your needs would be the same I
 
05:24:17.990 --> 05:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
just want to throw it open um I just as
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
a committee I think we'd be interested
 
05:24:23.510 --> 05:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
to hear what you had to say thank you oh
 
05:24:25.948 --> 05:24:25.958 align:start position:0%
that is a a tough question to answer
 
05:24:28.430 --> 05:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative AA as we go through this
 
05:24:31.948 --> 05:24:31.958 align:start position:0%
whole process uh what I will say is that
 
05:24:34.868 --> 05:24:34.878 align:start position:0%
um as you can see our our needs are um
 
05:24:37.430 --> 05:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
basic and entirely tied to either
 
05:24:40.548 --> 05:24:40.558 align:start position:0%
maintaining the spaces that we have or
 
05:24:42.910 --> 05:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
creating more opportunities with
 
05:24:46.350 --> 05:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
industry I don't expect as we go forward
 
05:24:49.910 --> 05:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
with this that our needs would change uh
 
05:24:52.670 --> 05:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
what I have been saying is that and
 
05:24:54.990 --> 05:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
frankly this is a great example of an
 
05:24:59.190 --> 05:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
area that needs to be looked at um I'm a
 
05:25:01.030 --> 05:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
hearing right now from our technical
 
05:25:03.868 --> 05:25:03.878 align:start position:0%
faculty you can imagine that our College
 
05:25:05.708 --> 05:25:05.718 align:start position:0%
faculty and staff and students are
 
05:25:07.548 --> 05:25:07.558 align:start position:0%
concerned about what it would mean to
 
05:25:10.430 --> 05:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
merge and the technical faculty have
 
05:25:13.230 --> 05:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
already said to me Susan you know what's
 
05:25:17.030 --> 05:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
the circumstance in which our request
 
05:25:20.470 --> 05:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
for you know new auto lifts for example
 
05:25:23.310 --> 05:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
will measure up to the University's
 
05:25:25.708 --> 05:25:25.718 align:start position:0%
request for some sort you know some type
 
05:25:28.868 --> 05:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
of heavyduty research equipment so it is
 
05:25:32.070 --> 05:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
an area that we will be concerned about
 
05:25:34.150 --> 05:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
um you know the impact on what we're
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
asking for right now there there is none
 
05:25:38.510 --> 05:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
these are these are things that we need
 
05:25:40.990 --> 05:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
but going forward we absolutely have
 
05:25:44.670 --> 05:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
questions about um what will
 
05:25:48.190 --> 05:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
happen so thank you for raising it but
 
05:25:50.708 --> 05:25:50.718 align:start position:0%
we still need more information going
 
05:25:52.788 --> 05:25:52.798 align:start position:0%
forward well it's a tough one on a
 
05:25:54.670 --> 05:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
Friday afternoon so I'm
 
05:25:57.590 --> 05:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
sorry no I I you know it it's the
 
05:25:59.708 --> 05:25:59.718 align:start position:0%
elephant in every room that I've been in
 
05:26:02.190 --> 05:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
recently so I I don't mind you raising
 
05:26:03.948 --> 05:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
it at all thank you for the opportunity
 
05:26:09.990 --> 05:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:11.910 --> 05:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:26:15.510 --> 05:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
questions um to the chancellor or any of
 
05:26:18.750 --> 05:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
her staff or the member of the trustees
 
05:26:18.760 --> 05:26:22.110 align:start position:0%
her staff or the member of the trustees
representative

05:26:22.110 --> 05:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:27.430 --> 05:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:31.150 --> 05:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
yourself um thank thank you Mr chairman
 
05:26:33.390 --> 05:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Chancellor for being here
 
05:26:34.990 --> 05:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
before I go there I'd be remiss if I
 
05:26:38.350 --> 05:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
didn't say hello to my old chairman uh
 
05:26:41.948 --> 05:26:41.958 align:start position:0%
Smokey there and uh no doubt about it
 
05:26:45.430 --> 05:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
well trained by you uh going going back
 
05:26:48.990 --> 05:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
back to the um the to the
 
05:26:51.628 --> 05:26:51.638 align:start position:0%
chancellor uh in the past and I've been
 
05:26:54.670 --> 05:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
away a couple years in the past uh I've
 
05:26:58.230 --> 05:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
always touted um about how the people
 
05:27:03.910 --> 05:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
you train um um remain in our uh in our
 
05:27:06.190 --> 05:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
employe in the state raise their
 
05:27:09.070 --> 05:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
families they're here uh much greater
 
05:27:12.150 --> 05:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
than the uh University system and I
 
05:27:15.310 --> 05:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
remember numbers somewhere approaching
 
05:27:18.030 --> 05:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
90% has that been updated the last few
 
05:27:20.030 --> 05:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
years do you have some idea of your
 
05:27:23.868 --> 05:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
census we do we do it's at least 93%
 
05:27:25.788 --> 05:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
representative and depending upon the
 
05:27:28.670 --> 05:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
college we're talking about it can be
 
05:27:30.510 --> 05:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
97% oh wait a minute I think I'm
 
05:27:31.948 --> 05:27:31.958 align:start position:0%
answering the wrong question I'm
 
05:27:33.948 --> 05:27:33.958 align:start position:0%
answering the question of who comes in
 
05:27:36.830 --> 05:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
terms of who stays from what we can see
 
05:27:39.270 --> 05:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
and actually we gave you slide on that
 
05:27:41.310 --> 05:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to actually look at it it's
 
05:27:41.320 --> 05:27:43.350 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to actually look at it it's
slide

05:27:43.350 --> 05:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
slide
 
05:27:43.360 --> 05:27:44.868 align:start position:0%
slide
four

05:27:44.868 --> 05:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
four
 
05:27:48.270 --> 05:27:48.280 align:start position:0%
so uh the percent of of our graduates
 
05:27:51.868 --> 05:27:51.878 align:start position:0%
employed in the state is about
 
05:27:51.878 --> 05:27:53.628 align:start position:0%
employed in the state is about
77%

05:27:53.628 --> 05:27:53.638 align:start position:0%
77%
 
05:27:58.270 --> 05:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
overall the about 23% are self-employed
 
05:28:00.190 --> 05:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
and we don't have a way to capture that
 
05:28:03.910 --> 05:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
but to to the point at least 93% of the
 
05:28:06.190 --> 05:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
students across our system are New
 
05:28:09.548 --> 05:28:09.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents we think that they
 
05:28:11.830 --> 05:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know certainly well beyond the
 
05:28:14.370 --> 05:28:14.380 align:start position:0%
77% stay
 
05:28:14.380 --> 05:28:15.510 align:start position:0%
77% stay
[Music]

05:28:15.510 --> 05:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:28:18.590 --> 05:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
um I I would just add this this data is
 
05:28:22.310 --> 05:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
is data that we derive um with or from
 
05:28:24.868 --> 05:28:24.878 align:start position:0%
Employment Security so you it's
 
05:28:27.190 --> 05:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
imperfect as a measure but it captures a
 
05:28:29.750 --> 05:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
lot there are certain um certain folks
 
05:28:31.708 --> 05:28:31.718 align:start position:0%
it won't capture so if people are
 
05:28:33.548 --> 05:28:33.558 align:start position:0%
engaged in wages that don't fall within
 
05:28:35.190 --> 05:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
what employment security tracks they
 
05:28:37.548 --> 05:28:37.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't show up in that dark blue bar
 
05:28:39.430 --> 05:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
um but the light blue bar you know for
 
05:28:42.030 --> 05:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
instance also includes community college
 
05:28:43.788 --> 05:28:43.798 align:start position:0%
students who graduate from us and then
 
05:28:46.830 --> 05:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
transfer on for another two years maybe
 
05:28:48.788 --> 05:28:48.798 align:start position:0%
at pmus state or Keane or UNH or sne or
 
05:28:51.030 --> 05:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere else so we also you know we
 
05:28:52.948 --> 05:28:52.958 align:start position:0%
certainly get graduates out into the
 
05:28:54.430 --> 05:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
workforce quickly in New Hampshire
 
05:28:56.548 --> 05:28:56.558 align:start position:0%
communities but we also are a platform
 
05:28:57.948 --> 05:28:57.958 align:start position:0%
as you know for students who wish to
 
05:28:57.958 --> 05:28:59.150 align:start position:0%
as you know for students who wish to
transfer

05:28:59.150 --> 05:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
05:29:01.948 --> 05:29:01.958 align:start position:0%
on thank you for all you folks do thank
 
05:29:05.030 --> 05:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman you're welcome
 
05:29:07.470 --> 05:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
representative Jack uh thank you Mr
 
05:29:09.470 --> 05:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you Chancellor
 
05:29:11.070 --> 05:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
it's always lovely to see the Community
 
05:29:12.868 --> 05:29:12.878 align:start position:0%
College I'll start by mentioning that I
 
05:29:14.590 --> 05:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
think it was last ter we did go on a
 
05:29:17.350 --> 05:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
field trip to the uh to Manchester and
 
05:29:19.670 --> 05:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
saw the new building and went through
 
05:29:21.628 --> 05:29:21.638 align:start position:0%
all the old buildings so that that's a
 
05:29:25.310 --> 05:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
nice facility there uh some years ago I
 
05:29:28.430 --> 05:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
was advocating for trying to get uh some
 
05:29:30.230 --> 05:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
space on the national airport for the
 
05:29:32.788 --> 05:29:32.798 align:start position:0%
aviation maintenance technology people
 
05:29:34.830 --> 05:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
so they could bring in actual airplanes
 
05:29:38.070 --> 05:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
to a hanger and work on them instead of
 
05:29:40.110 --> 05:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
being way over there at the community
 
05:29:42.430 --> 05:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
college and we put a small amount of
 
05:29:44.190 --> 05:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
money in there for that and it seems
 
05:29:45.910 --> 05:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
like it's not gone anywhere if you
 
05:29:50.270 --> 05:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to comment on that at all um I
 
05:29:51.788 --> 05:29:51.798 align:start position:0%
just know a little bit and I don't know
 
05:29:54.590 --> 05:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
if Shannon knows that's an ongoing
 
05:29:57.030 --> 05:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
concern for us I know that President
 
05:30:00.070 --> 05:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
Jordan is looking at the aviation
 
05:30:00.080 --> 05:30:04.070 align:start position:0%
Jordan is looking at the aviation
program

05:30:04.070 --> 05:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:07.430 --> 05:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm afraid I don't know much about it
 
05:30:09.470 --> 05:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
I know that the enrollment in that
 
05:30:11.350 --> 05:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
program has uh
 
05:30:14.430 --> 05:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
slumped um so I will put that in the
 
05:30:16.110 --> 05:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
category of representative Jack we'll
 
05:30:18.670 --> 05:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
we'll get back to you with specific
 
05:30:21.470 --> 05:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
information um about it and I know there
 
05:30:24.948 --> 05:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
had been an effort um to move it to
 
05:30:28.830 --> 05:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
either um nashwa uh to an airport or
 
05:30:31.750 --> 05:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
even to um the Manchester Airport I
 
05:30:33.070 --> 05:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
remember those
 
05:30:35.190 --> 05:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
conversations obviously that has not
 
05:30:38.750 --> 05:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
happened but I I I don't know much more
 
05:30:40.430 --> 05:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
right now other than the program is
 
05:30:42.270 --> 05:30:42.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely under
 
05:30:46.430 --> 05:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:50.548 --> 05:30:50.558 align:start position:0%
thanks any other questions for the
 
05:30:53.708 --> 05:30:53.718 align:start position:0%
chancellor or anybody from her staff
 
05:30:56.230 --> 05:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
about this
 
05:30:58.830 --> 05:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
presentation see
 
05:31:01.590 --> 05:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
none I understand I understand my
 
05:31:03.708 --> 05:31:03.718 align:start position:0%
homework um coming out of this um we
 
05:31:06.230 --> 05:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
will provide you with a a maintenance a
 
05:31:08.230 --> 05:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance breakdown um you
 
05:31:09.548 --> 05:31:09.558 align:start position:0%
currently have it by college but we'll
 
05:31:12.110 --> 05:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
provide it more by by type of project or
 
05:31:14.910 --> 05:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
by project um second we'll we'll itemize
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
and prioritize our it uh projects within
 
05:31:22.150 --> 05:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
that larger request um third I have a
 
05:31:24.750 --> 05:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
number of um letters of support from
 
05:31:28.548 --> 05:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
Littleton area businesses and um Civic
 
05:31:29.990 --> 05:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh leaders and organizations that I'll
 
05:31:32.110 --> 05:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
provide to you for the Littleton project
 
05:31:33.470 --> 05:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
um so you'll be able to see the the
 
05:31:35.628 --> 05:31:35.638 align:start position:0%
degree and nature of the of the real
 
05:31:37.030 --> 05:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
desire for that project to move forward
 
05:31:39.070 --> 05:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
in Littleton and then uh fourth
 
05:31:40.390 --> 05:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative Jack's question about
 
05:31:42.590 --> 05:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
Aviation at nasua have I missed anything
 
05:31:44.510 --> 05:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
that that folks will want from us by way
 
05:31:44.520 --> 05:31:45.350 align:start position:0%
that that folks will want from us by way
of

05:31:45.350 --> 05:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:31:48.910 --> 05:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
followup not that I can think of Shannon
 
05:31:52.868 --> 05:31:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:55.310 --> 05:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
you that you'll give whatever money the
 
05:31:57.548 --> 05:31:57.558 align:start position:0%
community college is asking for yeah
 
05:31:57.558 --> 05:31:58.948 align:start position:0%
community college is asking for yeah
that's

05:31:58.948 --> 05:31:58.958 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:32:04.670 --> 05:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
it um but we will look at all of that um
 
05:32:08.470 --> 05:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
as as you all know it's always difficult
 
05:32:13.350 --> 05:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
to prioritize and add uh projects that
 
05:32:16.070 --> 05:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
are not included within the the
 
05:32:19.030 --> 05:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal and still stay under
 
05:32:20.030 --> 05:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
what the
 
05:32:25.070 --> 05:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
treasurer um suggests that we Bond at so
 
05:32:27.628 --> 05:32:27.638 align:start position:0%
it it is a challenge and we we are up to
 
05:32:29.990 --> 05:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
it and that's why we do need that
 
05:32:32.750 --> 05:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
additional information that we ask for
 
05:32:35.390 --> 05:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
um to see what if anything that we can
 
05:32:37.628 --> 05:32:37.638 align:start position:0%
give to you because tomorrow we hear
 
05:32:39.670 --> 05:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
from the university system and you could
 
05:32:43.470 --> 05:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
imagine that they will be asking for um
 
05:32:46.110 --> 05:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
additional funds as well I I fully
 
05:32:48.868 --> 05:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
anticipate that no not tomorrow next
 
05:32:52.390 --> 05:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
Wednesday I'm lasted here well we we
 
05:32:54.230 --> 05:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
also look forward to a time when we can
 
05:32:56.270 --> 05:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
bring you again to one of our campuses
 
05:32:59.350 --> 05:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
and show you the the fruits of the of
 
05:32:59.360 --> 05:33:00.070 align:start position:0%
and show you the the fruits of the of
the

05:33:00.070 --> 05:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:33:01.788 --> 05:33:01.798 align:start position:0%
consideration that you're able to give
 
05:33:03.390 --> 05:33:03.400 align:start position:0%
to us in the capital budget it was a
 
05:33:06.110 --> 05:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
good tour of the haac area last time and
 
05:33:07.430 --> 05:33:07.440 align:start position:0%

05:33:09.670 --> 05:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
to keep many things that right now we we
 
05:33:09.680 --> 05:33:11.110 align:start position:0%
to keep many things that right now we we
can't

05:33:11.110 --> 05:33:11.120 align:start position:0%

we think we can do about it it is not an
 
05:34:58.230 --> 05:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
executive session but we will start to
 
05:35:01.430 --> 05:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
try to uh narrow in on what dollar
 
05:35:04.990 --> 05:35:05.000 align:start position:0%

and it has gotten greater since um the
 
05:35:27.310 --> 05:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
all of the deadlines have been pushed
 
05:35:29.948 --> 05:35:29.958 align:start position:0%

there's two bills in front of your
 
05:36:11.670 --> 05:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
committee that you have now if they were
 
05:36:14.548 --> 05:36:14.558 align:start position:0%
to be um passed without being included
 
05:36:16.030 --> 05:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
in the capital budget how do they
 
05:36:18.788 --> 05:36:18.798 align:start position:0%
include that towards the the recommended
 
05:36:23.390 --> 05:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
number um you know of 120 to 125 million
 
05:36:25.070 --> 05:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to let you know that
 
05:36:27.708 --> 05:36:27.718 align:start position:0%
and then as as a result of that I can
 
05:36:29.948 --> 05:36:29.958 align:start position:0%
report back or do you want me to have
 
05:36:31.628 --> 05:36:31.638 align:start position:0%
the treasurer come speak to you on
 
05:36:33.510 --> 05:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
Wednesday afternoon briefly just to
 
05:36:36.390 --> 05:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
update you on um maybe what how they
 
05:36:38.948 --> 05:36:38.958 align:start position:0%
would handle that information
 
05:36:42.990 --> 05:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
I Chris I think that if you could ask
 
05:36:44.708 --> 05:36:44.718 align:start position:0%
the treasury if she could be there at
 
05:36:47.470 --> 05:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
12:30 or one somewhere in there right
 
05:36:51.750 --> 05:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
after we get started um just in case any
 
05:36:53.910 --> 05:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
of the members of the committee have
 
05:36:56.990 --> 05:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
further questions of of the treasurer we
 
05:37:00.030 --> 05:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
won't be long with her but it's always
 
05:37:04.230 --> 05:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
good to hear from from the treasurer on
 
05:37:06.990 --> 05:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
her thoughts on what it is I don't think
 
05:37:08.670 --> 05:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to change much from what she
 
05:37:11.070 --> 05:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
said earlier where she was talking big
 
05:37:14.670 --> 05:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
numbers to change the debt ratio but
 
05:37:17.070 --> 05:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
let's hear what she has to say as a
 
05:37:19.548 --> 05:37:19.558 align:start position:0%
committee agreed and and again I just
 
05:37:22.590 --> 05:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to um get an accounting for you
 
05:37:24.110 --> 05:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
guys so that when you're looking at you
 
05:37:26.788 --> 05:37:26.798 align:start position:0%
know how much you think you have for
 
05:37:29.110 --> 05:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
space potentially is it different if
 
05:37:30.910 --> 05:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
they have to include the 17 million
 
05:37:34.350 --> 05:37:34.360 align:start position:0%
that's in the um in in House Bill
