please thank you mr chair
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
um the bill i'm
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
talking about today i'm introducing
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
housefield 1026 i'm the main sponsor on
 
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.110 align:start position:0%
housefield 1026 i'm the main sponsor on
that

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
it's relative to the budget information
 
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to read you the analysis
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's very easy very simple bill
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
bill provides that a municipal budget
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
committee may require that the governing
 
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.710 align:start position:0%
committee may require that the governing
body

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
provide options in full line item detail
 
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
in active spreadsheet form
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
um some of you uh know uh from past with
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
me on this bill
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
i had house 14 house bill 1460
 
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.990 align:start position:0%
i had house 14 house bill 1460
and

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
that went down in flames in the senate
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
because they tabled it
 
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
we did come to an agreement
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
the chair at the time was
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
chair carson
 
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
and between him i and uh
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
cordell johnson
 
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
we came up with a solution to my bill
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
because it was a little confusing
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
and it was a simple
 
00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh bill and that's
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
a simple solution and that is
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
in front of you today
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
in committee
 
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
was itl
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
uh with the help of uh representative
 
00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:01.510 align:start position:0%
uh with the help of uh representative
mambuket

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
mambuket
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
um like i say
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
chair carson and cordell johnson we came
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
up with one sentence
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
and that is what the analysis basically
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
says and if you look on the back
 
00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.189 align:start position:0%
says and if you look on the back
that

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
budget committee may require a governing
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
body to provide its budget
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations in full line of my item
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
detail and active spreadsheet form to
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
the members of the budget committee
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
so someone at the budget committee comes
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
in with a motion well i'd like to say
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
add two thousand dollars to this bill
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
to this line
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
and if they had what the line
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
covers say it was maintenance and repair
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh for vehicles
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh it would also show
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
um say tires you know
 
00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
tune-ups or whatever maintenance they
 
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
may need to the bill
 
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
governing vehicles or tires for that
 
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.190 align:start position:0%
governing vehicles or tires for that
matter

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:05.910 align:start position:0%
matter
so

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
they can put that figure in their
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
computer on their
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
desktop right at the meeting help school
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
come to a
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
a very solid decision whether it would
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
be good or bad
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
we did on in the house session
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
on that house bill 1460 we
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
amended that and we overturned the itl
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
i believe it was 283 to 8.
 
00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:41.190 align:start position:0%
i believe it was 283 to 8.
so

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
it was a a partisan bill and both sides
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
agreed to it
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately it was tabled in the
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
senate uh first time around i changed it
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
a little bit and they did make some
 
00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:55.190 align:start position:0%
a little bit and they did make some
recommendations

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
to do that but they only went down a
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
couple of lines
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
uh in our first session and i thought
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
that i felt that this part here was
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
necessary for the people in the in
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
committee to actually do their job and
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
and it would be more kind of beneficial
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
and they would learn more about their
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
budget processes
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much it and i'll take
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh some questions
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh questions from the committee as
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative rum
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
i'm curious um
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
is there anything that prevents a
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
governing body from doing this already
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases not a lot i should say
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
i've seen
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
many cases that
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
they would have to take a vote
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
in order to to do this
 
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.790 align:start position:0%
in order to to do this
and

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
a budget committee
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
in most places will go over each
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
individual lines but some don't some
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
come in and they say well this is our
 
00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:55.110 align:start position:0%
come in and they say well this is our
budget

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.150 align:start position:0%
budget
um

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
go through it you know and stack a paper
 
00:10:58.399 --> 00:10:59.110 align:start position:0%
go through it you know and stack a paper
and

00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
there's no uh no real
 
00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:02.630 align:start position:0%
there's no uh no real
uh

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
digging into the budget itself
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
and they take a vote and if the vote is
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
not in favor of doing this it
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
goes back to uh their standard way of
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
developing their program
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
do you know of any governing bodies that
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
already do this that can be used as a
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
best case practice sandown does it
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
actually okay um i had one individual he
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
was on there a couple years ago he used
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
to take his computer all the time and he
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
went to the to the office and he said i
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
need to download the budget to my
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
computer and he gave him a
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
thumb drive they put it on the thumb
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
drive and they they gave it to him he
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
worked it he worked that and that was
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why i started this
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
process two sessions ago
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.910 align:start position:0%
 
some

00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
some budget some governing bodies are
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
very amenable to uh this procedure and
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
they'll do that
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
others don't want to be bothered and
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know you know it all goes downhill
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
if you have uh
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
a high budget
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes we've heard testimony
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
on different things pertaining to the
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
budget so far
 
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.790 align:start position:0%
budget so far
so

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's just one way of giving an
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to not only the budget
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
committee to to learn more about it but
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
also project that to the people
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
listening and and and coming to the
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
meetings so okay thank you
 
00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:39.750 align:start position:0%
meetings so okay thank you
representative

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
so i understand what the intent of this
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
um bill is but i'm a little bit
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
concerned with the language
 
00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:52.389 align:start position:0%
concerned with the language
because

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
line three
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
the wording is may require to provide
 
00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.829 align:start position:0%
the wording is may require to provide
so

00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
that means what that's saying to me is
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
that the budget committee
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
they might or might not ask
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
this information from the
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
governing body
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
and additionally
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
is there anything that
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
compels or
 
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.509 align:start position:0%
compels or
forces

00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
forces
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
the governing body in response to to
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
actually provide the information i don't
 
00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:26.310 align:start position:0%
actually provide the information i don't
see

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.430 align:start position:0%
see
a

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.350 align:start position:0%
a
shall

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
shall
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
provide coming from the governing body
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
so i well i understand the intent
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
do you share do do you see what i'm
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
saying and i understand i can have an
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
amendment uh made to change made a shell
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to go easy on everybody
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
first you know
 
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.670 align:start position:0%
first you know
okay

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
microphone i can't hear you
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
my apologies i just wanted to know what
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
the definition in this of governing body
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
and active spreadsheet
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay governing body is any any school
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
board any budget committee school board
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
committee budget committee um
 
00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:14.470 align:start position:0%
committee budget committee um
and

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
active spreadsheet means
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
the one they're using now to present the
 
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.949 align:start position:0%
the one they're using now to present the
budget

00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up sir yes thank you um but it
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be the live spreadsheet
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
in other words you you it doesn't have
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
to be the live spreadsheet in other
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
words you said you would give them a
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
copy with a thumb drive so it's not
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
something that has to be
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
they can't edit what exists on on the um
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry i know i'm not being
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
clear so for instance if i make a change
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
to it just because i want to
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
diddle here to to see how i could change
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
the budget for a better it's not going
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
to change it on the the city the
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
municipal system correct that is correct
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
the the town the town city or um
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
governing the uh
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
pearson the people that generate the
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
budget will have a master copy that will
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
not change
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
and those will
 
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.790 align:start position:0%
question um
so

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
that line number three the budget
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
committee may require a governing body
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
to provide its budget recommendations in
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
full line item detail and active
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet format so
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
when you say the budget committee
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
may require so all this takes
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
is a majority vote of the budget
 
00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:44.949 align:start position:0%
is a majority vote of the budget
committee

00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
to require this to happen is that
 
00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:48.870 align:start position:0%
to require this to happen is that
correct

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
yes but representative power asked me to
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
change that made a
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
and if they ask for it they they will
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
get it and under those conditions
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
but it is
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry follow-up yes it is enabling
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
the budget committee doesn't have to do
 
00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:08.150 align:start position:0%
the budget committee doesn't have to do
this

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
at this point with that may in there
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
that is correct and and i probably
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't uh change that i agree with
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
that because
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
if somebody does request a copy of it
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
they should be and they're on those
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
committees they should be able to see
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.990 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
yes

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
oh sorry thank you mr chair
 
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.990 align:start position:0%
oh sorry thank you mr chair
um

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
i'm following up on representative cle's
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
question about
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet format because in the on
 
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.910 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet format because in the on
line

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
four it says full line item
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
detail in active spreadsheet format
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
so an active spreadsheet is it not
 
00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.710 align:start position:0%
so an active spreadsheet is it not
editable

00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
editable
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
yes of course it is and that will be
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
edited by the budget committee only or
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
budget committee member only
 
00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.350 align:start position:0%
budget committee member only
and

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
that would not affect the original
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
budget at all they could make those
 
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.510 align:start position:0%
budget at all they could make those
decisions

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.390 align:start position:0%
decisions
from

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
the results of
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
a person questioning
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
um i would like to increase or decrease
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
this particular line
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
and this is the results that i have this
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
is what would happen
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
if i did that
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay so you can at your meeting at your
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
budget committee meeting you could say
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
well this is a good idea or a bad idea
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know and it gives them more
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
insight based basically in operating
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
that budget
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman yes go ahead um do
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
you have any concern about the edited
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
piece of
 
00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:49.270 align:start position:0%
piece of
the

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
budget committee has made their search
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
and found that this is a line item that
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
can be changed
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
do you have any concerns that
 
00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
that can then be
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
like a screenshot and
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
post it on on social media as this is
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
what it should be
 
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
and and and then there's a
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation of what is actually
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
the budget no i i believe the budget
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
committee members are completely
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
responsible for their actions okay
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
and those will be the only ones that
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
will see this
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
it isn't posted to the public it isn't
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
posted on um any
 
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
facebook page or anything like that a
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
budget committee individual has that on
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
his computer
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
so he can do his job more effectively
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
in the budget process
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
there's a big difference between uh the
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
shall is more
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
deter you know um represent your
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
question yeah so would you believe that
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
this would be too stringent
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
changing the word made to show
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
not at all it only applies to the budget
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
committee people and
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
it gives them the opportunity if they
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
want to do it they don't have to do it i
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
know on my uh
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
budget committee board for sandown we
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
had one person
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
request this
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
and any questions
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
were diverted by the chair
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh to the uh person can you look up on
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
the computer and say what that would
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
affect how that would affect this budget
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's plain and simple a quick
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair yes go ahead yeah
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
how would this impact right to no law
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the right to know
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for the
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
representative before i go to the public
 
00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:55.669 align:start position:0%
representative before i go to the public
yes

00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:57.029 align:start position:0%
yes
representative

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm noticing in the
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
analysis that it states that the bill
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
provides that a municipal budget
 
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.549 align:start position:0%
provides that a municipal budget
committee

00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:07.909 align:start position:0%
committee
and

00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill itself it only
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
references a budget committee so my
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
based on the language of the bill and
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
not the analysis this bill covers
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
school district budget committees
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
because some municipalities the the
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
their school district is not under
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
municipal budget correct and that it's a
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
school does cover the school budgets by
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
like any further questions i think mr
 
00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:45.750 align:start position:0%
like any further questions i think mr
mcguire

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
mcguire
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay for those of you in the audience
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
who have questions about
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 1026
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
we're very clean
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman dolmen and
 
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is catherine
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
heck from the new hampshire municipal
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
association and originally we did not
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
intend on speaking on this bill as it
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
was written
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
as the amendment um
 
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.350 align:start position:0%
as the amendment um
[Music]

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
has compelled me though to want to just
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
make some comments as to changing the
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
it would be best practice that a
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
municipal budget committee which would
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
cover school districts they're all under
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
municipal budget law or towns
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to have access to a line item
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
detail when they are preparing their
 
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.390 align:start position:0%
detail when they are preparing their
budgets

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
when you change may to shell it will now
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
be a requirement it wouldn't be a
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
request any longer that each individual
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
committee could make it would have to be
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
required that this information be passed
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
in this way in active spreadsheet format
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
the concerns that i have is in best
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
practice and in the way most of our
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
municipal governments and i can't speak
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
to all schools but several schools there
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
is of course access to this information
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
and typically there is someone
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
especially when we're getting into four
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
and four and 500 page documents of line
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
items someone within the
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
office staff that kind of manages these
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
versions because when you start to
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
manipulate one line on page 280 that
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
could get missed in the in the final
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
budget so in many cases there's an
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
individual that attends all these
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
meetings that make sure that all of
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
these changes are made and recorded and
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
it certainly doesn't preclude any
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
committee member budget committee member
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
from having access to this information
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
but in the effort to make sure that
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
someone's not
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
at home
 
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
changing the spreadsheet and then that
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
change isn't properly discussed at a
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
meeting and then transposed into the
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
final budget those are the concerns that
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
we would have
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
so we do prefer the language of may so
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
it stays a local option and again in
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
practice this should already be
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
occurring so that the budget committee
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
can do its work
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
and i can take any questions that you
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
might have are there any questions for
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
the nhma yes representative clean
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr heck
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
just just a quick one
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
having this document um in in a public
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
forum in electronic version does that
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
subject it to right to know by the
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
public to get a copy of this active
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet as well
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
i i would imagine that it would once a
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee would have
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
something it would become a public
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
record in electronic format i'm not
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
talking printed in electronic format
 
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.950 align:start position:0%
talking printed in electronic format
um

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that would be shared
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
in excel format with the public but
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
certainly in pdf format which they can
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
already request of course at any time
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
i just want to know about the electronic
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
u.s representative power
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
um is there anything in this bill that
 
00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:35.269 align:start position:0%
um is there anything in this bill that
prevents

00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
prevents
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
the act of
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
i just need some clarification active
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet means um
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
editable so my question was
 
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.390 align:start position:0%
editable so my question was
um

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
the wording of this bill
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
is it possible to
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
provide an uneditable i mean
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill is to provide
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
the information
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
but if there's concern about things
 
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.549 align:start position:0%
but if there's concern about things
being

00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:06.390 align:start position:0%
being
changed

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.590 align:start position:0%
changed
then

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
the solution would be to have it not be
 
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.510 align:start position:0%
the solution would be to have it not be
editable

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
editable
 
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.310 align:start position:0%
editable
and

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
well typically um whether it's a hard
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
copy or pdf format that is what would be
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
provided to a committee and again some
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
committees do have access to an editable
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and usually there's one
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
individual in charge of making sure that
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
that version
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
is done with fidelity and is then
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
reported as such moving forward through
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
this budget process so then it gets to
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
the time of the deliberative session or
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
the town meeting it is the accurate and
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
correct document too many people
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
accessing one document could lead to
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
just honest mistakes
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.909 align:start position:0%
any other
yes

00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:54.070 align:start position:0%
yes
representative

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
anja putin
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you uh for
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
um you kind of answered part of it so
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
the budget isn't it true that the
 
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
budget is a working
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
document and
 
00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:12.070 align:start position:0%
it is to be
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.430 align:start position:0%
it is to be
[Music]

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
edited or modified
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
in consensus as a team because it's an
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
important numbers game that we're
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
playing so
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
this would allow
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
individuals like you said you know and
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that create more of a
 
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.950 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that create more of a
bookkeeping

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
bookkeeping
 
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.269 align:start position:0%
bookkeeping
nightmare

00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
nightmare
 
00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:38.390 align:start position:0%
nightmare
potentially

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.830 align:start position:0%
potentially
representative

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you miss
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
heck for taking my question do you see
 
00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.950 align:start position:0%
heck for taking my question do you see
any

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.909 align:start position:0%
any
issue

00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
um whether this be shall or may
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
aside do you see any issue between
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
having an advisory budget committee and
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
a budget committee that
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
is going to make final decisions about
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
the budget if if there's a request for
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
an active spreadsheet do you see any
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
issue there just on that one piece
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
my understanding with that this would be
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
official budget committees but again
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
even advisory committees should have
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
access to the line item detail that they
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
need to be even advisory in nature
 
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.669 align:start position:0%
need to be even advisory in nature
so

00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
the active spreadsheet format
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
is just a concern due to the multiple
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
versions that can start to be created
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
and then not properly transposed over
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
time because it's usually a six-month
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
process to do the budget so that would
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
be the concern that we have with the
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
active spreadsheet
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
but someone i think
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
well i'm
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
clear that a law was passed last year to
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
ensure that the public can have access
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
to the full line item detail now as well
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
so certainly um it's important that
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
everyone have the access that they need
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
to make proper
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
decisions and deliberate the budget
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
accurately and properly and i think that
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
is already occurring in most situations
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
if there's exceptions to that um
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
certainly the may versus the show should
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
alleviate that in some communities if
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's not the case
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.159 --> 00:28:24.630 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.830 align:start position:0%
yes

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
industry experts about this bill
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
in spite of the fact or
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
recognizing the fact that
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
i have been invested in this since it
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
first came to municipality county
 
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.269 align:start position:0%
first came to municipality county
government

00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
legislation there are updates
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
there is progress being made across the
 
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.350 align:start position:0%
there is progress being made across the
country

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
that will address many of the issues
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
that are not addressed in this bill
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
right now to make it a much better bill
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
if we try to pass this bill
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
as it is right now
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
this will not be effective it will not
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
solve any problems in fact it may cause
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
more problems because it doesn't resolve
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
the issue of tiny homes on wheels
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
and that is the real issue
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
where we're trying to
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
find the codes find the standards find
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
the regulations that will make this an
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
effective piece of legislation
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
so with that said mr chair
 
00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
i ask i respectfully ask that the
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
committee maybe even consider executive
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
session now on this bill to go to itl i
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%

any questions thank you representative
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
if we took this to executive session
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.789 align:start position:0%
right now
yes

00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um may i ask a question of
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
the sponsor yes oh thank you
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative a question
 
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
some of the current concerns you have
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
about this bill can they be addressed
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
through amendment
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
they could not because it would take a a
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
re it would require a rewrite of almost
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
everything that is in this bill
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
um it would not be something that we
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
could merely amend
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
um possibly i shouldn't say that it
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
possibly could be amended however
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
based on the advice that i have been
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
giving again from india industry experts
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
we might be able to just cut and pay
 
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.510 align:start position:0%
we might be able to just cut and pay
something

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
coming out of colorado right now that
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
will fix this it would just take a few
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
months better to do that and get it
 
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.349 align:start position:0%
months better to do that and get it
right

00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
then pass something now that is going to
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
have to be that's going to hemorrhage
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have to rework
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
better to take some time to do it right
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
once then half right twice does that
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
yes well thank you mr chair i'm not
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%

international building code council is
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
actually working on this right now
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
and that new hampshire is looking at
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
building code updates that have to do
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
with tiny houses
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
question you are correct and to build

upon that right now tiny homes
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
a tiny home
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
could be built in the state of new
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire on a foundation appendix q was
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
adopted which sets the standards for a
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
tiny home we're really trying to get to
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
that piece about the on wheels you're
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
we're halfway there we just need a
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
little more time to get all the way
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%

the previous
 
00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.710 align:start position:0%
the previous
question

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
what other bills that you alluded to
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
other bills that are enabling tiny homes
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
what other that are currently law or
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
currently modified
 
00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.710 align:start position:0%
currently modified
that

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
can facilitate
 
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
a tiny home
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i understand

correctly
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
do you mean what what uh existing
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
legislation or standards exist
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
so again appendix q
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
will sets the definitions for what a
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
tiny home is a tiny home is a very
 
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.270 align:start position:0%
tiny home is a tiny home is a very
specific

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.630 align:start position:0%
specific
structure

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
we can talk about a small home that's
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
different a tiny home is a specific
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
structure which has already set forth in
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
appendix q which those standards were
 
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.270 align:start position:0%
appendix q which those standards were
adopted

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
the end of last year as i recall so
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
again a tiny home
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
can be built on a piece of property as
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.230 align:start position:0%

live in manchester new hampshire got it
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
i had recently purchased some land in
 
00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:31.589 align:start position:0%
i had recently purchased some land in
manchester

00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
i had contacted the zoning department
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
about building a tiny home and they had
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
told me if it's under 320 square foot it
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
is not legal
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
to build
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if that's
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
what appendix q references that you were
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
talking about but it seems contrary to
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
my personal experience
 
00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:51.190 align:start position:0%
my personal experience
um

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
i did have some written comments but i
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to address that first
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
because that was a little puzzling to me
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
looks like uh there's a representative
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.230 align:start position:0%
yes representative
uh

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
i know the answer to this question
 
00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:14.950 align:start position:0%
i know the answer to this question
um

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
there's no way to formulate it as a
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
question so i'll pass
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh any other questions
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to say that new
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire is facing the worst housing
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
shortage that we've had in our recorded
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
history as far as i can see
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
in january i checked the mls and there
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
were less than a thousand houses for
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
sale in the entire state
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
this problem has
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
essentially been created by restrictive
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
local ordinances that forbid
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
building and living in smaller homes
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
and lot utilization rules
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
according to the new hampshire coalition
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
to end homelessness there were 4
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
451 people
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
who experienced homelessness in 2021
 
00:39:55.599 --> 00:39:56.589 align:start position:0%
who experienced homelessness in 2021
and

00:39:56.589 --> 00:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
1577 of those were families that
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
experienced homelessness
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
you couldn't even buy every home and
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
give them to the homeless people there's
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
not enough homes as it stands
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
allowing tiny home communities as listed
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
in the bill offers a legal and voluntary
 
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.950 align:start position:0%
in the bill offers a legal and voluntary
solution

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
for philanthropists to create real
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
solutions right now to house the
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
homeless that are outside as we speak
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
please take a moment and imagine
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
sleeping outdoors
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anyone here has thought
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
about that and what that's like
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
most of us have warm homes to go to
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
if you oppose this bill you're stopping
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
an actual solution to help 1005
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
families from freezing to death in the
 
00:40:41.359 --> 00:40:43.190 align:start position:0%
families from freezing to death in the
cold

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
cold
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
um so with that i'd be happy to take any
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
questions that any reps have
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative gallagher
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
yeah um could i just get um the spelling
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
of your name for note taking purposes
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
like is it a v or ph
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i did fill out a card and submitted
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh and last name dave's d-d-a-v-e-s
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
like i said it is on the car okay thanks
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions actually
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
there's one over here
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
you said you have you purchased a piece
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
of land was it part of uh
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
you know tiny home community building or
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
is it a regular plot of land that you
 
00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.430 align:start position:0%
is it a regular plot of land that you
buy

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
buy
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
so it's a regular plot of land the most
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
common plot of land available in
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
manchester is r1a
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
it is the standard piece of land that is
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
actually the specific type of land that
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
this bill references
 
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.670 align:start position:0%
this bill references
um

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
so that's why i felt that it was
 
00:41:49.359 --> 00:41:51.750 align:start position:0%
so that's why i felt that it was
relevant

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr jan thank you for taking my
 
00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.630 align:start position:0%
thank you mr jan thank you for taking my
question

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.950 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.829 align:start position:0%
 
has

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:42:11.839 --> 00:42:13.670 align:start position:0%
has
the

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.950 align:start position:0%
the
homelessness

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
increased dramatically
 
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.670 align:start position:0%
increased dramatically
since

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
two years in the last year or two
 
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:22.870 align:start position:0%
two years in the last year or two
because

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
you stated that
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
this would help the housing shortage in
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and cordell johnson from
 
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire municipal association
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
said this is not a solution to the
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay well currently this would according
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
to the bill this would allow four tiny
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
homes to be put on a lot of land as i
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
read it i'm not a land use lawyer but
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
that seems to be the plain language in
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
i believe last year just from my reading
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire coalition to end
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
homelessness there were 35 encampments
 
00:43:01.599 --> 00:43:02.390 align:start position:0%
homelessness there were 35 encampments
that

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
required the police to go in and remove
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
the homeless people that had set up
 
00:43:07.359 --> 00:43:08.710 align:start position:0%
the homeless people that had set up
encampments

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
encampments
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
so does that mean
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
that if 35 pieces of land were set up to
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
create homeless
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
tiny home communities that it would be
 
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
an availability i'm not sure i don't
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
have all the answers but i don't think
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
that preventing a solution that could
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
create more houses is a very
 
00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:27.910 align:start position:0%
create more houses is a very
um

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
let's say heartfelt position for a
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
legislator to say when they themselves
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
that is actually written out
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
this bill takes tiny houses out of the
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
statewide legal gray area and makes them
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
explicitly lawful
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
while requiring them to meet life safety
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
codes and allow municipalities
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
some limited zoning control over them
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
it prevents municipalities from banning
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
tiny homes in single-family zones and it
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
allows tiny homes on existing
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
residential lots wherever detached
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units are allowed by
 
00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.510 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units are allowed by
zoning

00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
i guess this bill is a lame duck now
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor isn't here and the
 
00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.670 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor isn't here and the
co-sponsor

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
is suggesting itl that's a real shame
 
00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.230 align:start position:0%
is suggesting itl that's a real shame
because

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
aside from the comments from
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire municipal association
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
any additional housing that we can help
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
allow or create in this state is going
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
to mean
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
that there is less homelessness
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
and lower
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
rent and lower prices for everyone else
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:51.140 align:start position:0%
so i'm not exactly sure
 
00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.550 align:start position:0%
so i'm not exactly sure
[Music]

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
what his analysis includes it would be
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
interesting if
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
the municipal association was here
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
to make that case
 
00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.349 align:start position:0%
to make that case
um

00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
coincide with common sense that any
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity we have to make cheaper more
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
affordable housing in the state means
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
there will be fewer homeless in our
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and members of the
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
municipality county associate
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
committee i don't know where i am this
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
morning um i wanted to talk a little bit
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
about what i think is part of the
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
confusion that's happening this morning
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
um right now
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
under international building code the
 
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.710 align:start position:0%
under international building code the
ibc

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
ibc
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
there is an addendum which was adopted i
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
think at the end of last year
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
which is called appendix q
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
appendix q lays out the requirements for
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
a tiny house it talks about
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
cooking facilities sanitary facilities
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
adequate ventilation all of those things
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
and those refer to tiny houses that sit
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
on the ground so right now
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
you can build a tiny house in new
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire unless
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
the municipality in which you are trying
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
to build it
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
has a minimum square footage requirement
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
many jurisdictions have a minimum square
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
footage requirement of between three and
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
six hundred square feet some of them are
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
higher than that
 
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.150 align:start position:0%
higher than that
so

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
if your jurisdiction
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
for example peterborough new hampshire
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
where i serve on the planning board um
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
right now we have an amendment going
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
forward in our code that removes the
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
minimum square footage allowance we used
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
to have a minimum square footage of 400
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
square feet for a studio 600 square feet
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
for a one bedroom
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
i recommend it to the planning board
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
that we amend that and remove the
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
minimum because that's controlled by the
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
international building code the
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
international building code makes clear
 
00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:38.230 align:start position:0%
international building code makes clear
how

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
big the build the
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh a safe dwelling shall be and that's
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
for tiny houses that information is an
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
appendix q for anything that's not
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
considered tiny it's in the regular
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
international building code actually if
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's a single standalone building it's
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
international residential code to be
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
precise so when people are having
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
trouble building a tiny house
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
at this point in new hampshire if it's a
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
tiny house
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
not on wheels
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
then what they are likely bumping up
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
against is their local zoning code and
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
the minimum square foot requirement that
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
is in that code
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
i just want to make that clear that
 
00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.430 align:start position:0%
i just want to make that clear that
that's

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
it works across purposes to what the
 
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
state has done
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
with their building code and with that i
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
will take any questions thank you
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'd like to
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
understand can a tiny home on wheels
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
can is that permitted in a trailer park
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that question
 
00:49:48.079 --> 00:49:49.510 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that question
that's

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
i i don't know representative
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
how does that apply to
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
micro or mini
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
condos or
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
structure on a complex
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
if your local code says that the minimum
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
square footage for a dwelling unit is
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
400 square feet it doesn't matter where
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's a single standalone cottage
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
or part of a 400 unit apartment
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
complex it has to be at least 400 square
 
00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.589 align:start position:0%
complex it has to be at least 400 square
feet

00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
feet
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question so i understand that
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
with regard to the appendix q and the
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
international building codes
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
i guess safety
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
put forward minimum
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
square footage requirements as you've
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
explained so my question is is with
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
so long as
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
the tiny home meets that building code
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
is there anything
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
that prohibits
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
a certain number of people from
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
domiciling or living in that space could
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
you have five people or you know four
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
people living in a tiny home
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
that would be up to the local health
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
officer in terms of how much there are
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
minimum square footages but that's
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
administered in a different place the
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
ibc has to do with the construction of
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
how it's used after it's constructed

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
okay the the uh
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
the pre-hearing
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
count on this
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
another pink card coming in
 
00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:33.510 align:start position:0%
another pink card coming in
oh

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
robert tardif are you here in the room
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
you have two minutes mr charter
 
00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.790 align:start position:0%
you have two minutes mr charter
welcome

00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i can be less than two minutes
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
if you'd like
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
uh thank you my name is rob tarda i'm
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the subsurface
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
systems bureau in the department of
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
um we regulate on-site wastewater septic
 
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.109 align:start position:0%
um we regulate on-site wastewater septic
systems

00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
we also do subdivision of land
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh our only concerns really are about
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
wastewater and wastewater disposal
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
there's a line in the bill that says
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
alternatively there can be essentially
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
holding tanks in these
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
tiny homes whether it be for water
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
supply or wastewater
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
currently state law and our rules in the
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
env wq1000
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
prohibit holding tanks
 
00:53:32.079 --> 00:53:32.950 align:start position:0%
prohibit holding tanks
well

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
45a 32
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
says nobody shall construct a building
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have an approved wastewater
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
system from the department
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
say that we don't allow holding tanks
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
except for in three
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
separate scenarios one is if you have a
 
00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
failed system and there is no other
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
means for
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
a compliant on-site wastewater system
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
if you're about the second is if you're
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
about to be connected to a municipal
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
sewer within one year
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
and a third is for infrequent commercial
 
00:54:08.559 --> 00:54:10.230 align:start position:0%
and a third is for infrequent commercial
use

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:11.109 align:start position:0%
use
so

00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:11.119 --> 00:54:12.390 align:start position:0%
so
to

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
have holding tanks in a tiny home
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
so we
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
we're not opposed to the bill
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
we would support the bill with an
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
amendment to remove that statement about
 
00:54:29.359 --> 00:54:30.790 align:start position:0%
amendment to remove that statement about
alternatively

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
alternatively
 
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.150 align:start position:0%
alternatively
uh

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
self-contained i believe is the language
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
in the bill self-contained water and
 
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.230 align:start position:0%
in the bill self-contained water and
wastewater

00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
wastewater
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
then the other comment we have in our
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
letter of testimony is regarding tiny
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
home parks
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
and we would like to see some language
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
added to that part of the bill
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
to basically
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
go along with our language regarding
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
mobile home parks
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
that's your timer
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
i mean that was
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
pretty succinct i think on what the
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
department's position is i'd be happy to
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
take some questions any questions for
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative ron yeah thank you mr
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you mr tarta for
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.990 align:start position:0%
taking my question
would

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
assuming a tiny home might house one or
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
two people
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
and suppose the state changed their
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
rules to allow holding tanks
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
how large a holding tank would one need
 
00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.109 align:start position:0%
how large a holding tank would one need
to

00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
service the waste coming from that tiny
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
home from one or two occupants
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
currently our minimum holding tank size
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
is 2 000 gallons
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
which is a pretty significant size
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
volume a pretty large tank
 
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.109 align:start position:0%
volume a pretty large tank
so

00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
if if this bill oh yes follow up thank
 
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
you mr chair so if this bill
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
you know maybe not this particular bill
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
but one that addresses the whole chassis
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
and wheel issue better if it were to
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
move forward would the
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
des be
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
amenable to discussions to allow a
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
holding tank for tiny homes if it was
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
large enough to service
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
one or two people in that tiny home for
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
a year or two before it would need to be
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
pumped out
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh i would say never say never kind of
 
00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
okay answer uh what one of the main
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
concerns about holding tax and i'll try
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
to be brief again
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
is the expense that it that people incur
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
when it comes to actually having these
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
holding tanks pumped
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
and having the wastewater disposed
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
what we find happens is either holes
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
mysteriously get punched in these
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
holding tanks or
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
the material is removed and disposed in
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
other maybe
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
illegal methods
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
so those are those are the main reasons
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
why we try to discourage the use of
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
holding tanks
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not a matter of you know
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
if the holding tank is working you know
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
structurally sound and watertight it's
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
not really an environmental issue it's
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
more of the reality of the costs and
 
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
what happens to as a result of the cost
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
to disposal of the of the waste
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
just one more follow-up one more thank
 
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
those issues you described about holding
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
tanks would they not be true of also
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
septic tanks
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh not necessarily because with a septic
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
tank the effluent is leaving the tank
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh so when you get a tank pumped you can
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
get a tank pumped
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know every uh can depending on use
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
but uh every two three years
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
because the effluent's being disposed of
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
in a wastewater in a leech field
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
right and that wastewater is being
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
treated by the soil and
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
okay and that kind of thing thank you
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions for mr
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
tardiff thank you very much for your
 
00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much for for
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
your time
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
at this point in time
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
i've been encouraged by those around me
 
00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:03.430 align:start position:0%
i've been encouraged by those around me
to

00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
take this
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
particular bill to the next step
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
which will be
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
so during executive session we we change
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit how we operate
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
there will be no input from the public
 
00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.030 align:start position:0%
there will be no input from the public
and

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
the committee members
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
will discuss the bill
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh among themselves
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
and uh and then we will take a vote
 
00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
so and close the bill uh close hb
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
1068 the hearing of it but
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
specifically and we're now opening
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
1068 for executive
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh review
 
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.829 align:start position:0%
uh review
mr

00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
mr
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh
 
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
we should have pleased the committee i
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
would move itl for house bill
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
1068 and if there is a second i'd be
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
happy to speak to my motion a second
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
motion's been made and seconded is there
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the bill yes
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
i just want to state that
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
my support of the itl doesn't reflect
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
on my position on tiny homes i think
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
tiny homes are a great thing not just do
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
they address the housing issue the
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
housing needs of people that are lower
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
income but it provides a way for people
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
that just want to live a more simply a
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
simple life with less consumption to be
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
able to have their their housing reflect
 
00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:37.670 align:start position:0%
able to have their their housing reflect
that

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
any other yes representative
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
i see uh why the prime sponsor is our
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor is asking for an itl we had
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
this last term too
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
but there is a place for the tiny homes
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm encouraged with the fact that
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
there is appendix q
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
that can give
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
some somewhat you know not 300 square
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
foot but at least a 400 square foot
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
which can
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
smaller than you know smaller tiny home
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity or mini condos so
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that we can offer those
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities for folks that need in our
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i while i
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
just fully endorse the idea of the tiny
 
01:00:32.319 --> 01:00:33.270 align:start position:0%
just fully endorse the idea of the tiny
home

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.309 align:start position:0%
home
um

01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
i think as the co-sponsor said it this
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
isn't ready for
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
prime time and one of my concerns is
 
01:00:40.799 --> 01:00:41.829 align:start position:0%
prime time and one of my concerns is
that

01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
is the wheels problem because
 
01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:46.870 align:start position:0%
is the wheels problem because
[Music]

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years we passed some
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislation about taxation of
 
01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
of year-round camp campers in
 
01:00:53.839 --> 01:00:55.190 align:start position:0%
of year-round camp campers in
campgrounds

01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
campgrounds
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
that are now being taxed for
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
structures that are affixed to them
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
and doing this on wheels brings to me
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
brings up to me the same question how
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.309 align:start position:0%
yes representative
gallagher

01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
gallagher
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
so um i'd just like to echo the previous
 
01:01:15.359 --> 01:01:16.710 align:start position:0%
so um i'd just like to echo the previous
speaker's

01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
speaker's
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
comments um and would just like to raise
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
a point about procedure um since this is
 
01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:22.870 align:start position:0%
a point about procedure um since this is
the

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
second year of
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
a two-year legislative term
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
well in previous years
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
if we had concerns about or in the
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
previous half of this term if we had
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
concerns about a bill we might have
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
voted to retain it or refer to interim
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
study or something but
 
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
since we're in the second year of the
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
term that means we won't have time to do
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
either of those
 
01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.630 align:start position:0%
either of those
so

01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:49.990 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
yeah if
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
if we
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
if this had been a year earlier i would
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
avoid to retain our interim study but
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
since we're running out of time um the
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
only way to postpone it at this point is
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
would be itl
 
01:02:02.799 --> 01:02:04.870 align:start position:0%
would be itl
representative

thank you uh

full disclosure i just told uh
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative maggiore this my oldest
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
child lived in a 240 square foot tiny
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
house built inside of a 1995 school bus
 
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
but what i want to say is i hope that i
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
made clear in my testimony that the
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
issue now
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
for tiny homes not on wheels is
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
primarily local zoning ordinance
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative maggiore just told me
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
that in
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
northampton the minimum square footage
 
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:43.720 align:start position:0%
for for a house or a dwelling unit is
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
725 square feet
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
that is unconscious unconsciousable
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
people need to attack this is the thing
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
that can be done at the local level go
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
in talk to your planning board ask them
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
to lift the minimum you don't need a
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
minimum square foot
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
all of those health and safety issues
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
are dealt with by the international
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
building code and appendix q
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
just get rid of that minimum and then
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
people can build tiny houses
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%

01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
i have submitted written testimony

about a week ago i hope all of you have
 
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a persistent problem
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
with having more jobs than we have
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
people who can
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
accept and take those jobs and work
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
now part of that might be demographic
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
but part of it might be because
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
people can't find places to live
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
if you can't find a place to live you
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
can't take a job
 
01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.870 align:start position:0%
can't take a job
near

01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
near
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
unless you can find a place to live near
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
i've lived in epping for 14 years
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
since i've moved there i've watched
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
literally hundreds
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
of single-family homes constructed
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
all of them
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
in the three
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
four and five hundred thousand dollar
 
01:07:13.039 --> 01:07:14.390 align:start position:0%
four and five hundred thousand dollar
range

01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
range
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
homes that you would probably not
 
01:07:16.079 --> 01:07:17.270 align:start position:0%
homes that you would probably not
consider

01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.910 align:start position:0%
consider
affordable

01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
and our town facebook page
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
is frequently populated with messages
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
from people saying
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
in search of or in need of
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
an apartment a two bedroom apartment for
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
there are very few apartments in epping
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
and in fact in rockingham county
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
the average rental for a two bedroom
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
park apartment is 1652
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
which is the most expensive
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
average rental in the entire state of
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
rockingham county is the most expensive
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
place in the state to live
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
both for single-family homes and for
 
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
so what's really the definition of
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's housing that you can afford to move
 
01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.589 align:start position:0%
it's housing that you can afford to move
into

01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
if you make
 
01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:18.390 align:start position:0%
if you make
60

01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
60
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
of the average median income
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
so in rockingham county the average
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
median income
 
01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:31.990 align:start position:0%
median income
is

01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
significantly high
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
compared to other parts of the state and
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
that's what drives up the cost of
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
apartment dwelling to over sixteen
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a month
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
and that pushes it out of the affordable
 
01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.910 align:start position:0%
and that pushes it out of the affordable
range

01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
the other thing that distinguishes
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
affordable housing from other kinds of
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
housing is it typically
 
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.510 align:start position:0%
housing is it typically
is

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
multi-family dwelling units
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
it's not single-family dwelling units
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's multi-family apartment buildings
 
01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:10.149 align:start position:0%
it's multi-family apartment buildings
or

01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
houses that have been
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
converted to apartments
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
in dover if you ride through dover
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
many of these great big huge houses that
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
were built 150 years ago
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
when people had big families but now
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
many if not most of those buildings have
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
been converted to apartment buildings
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
they contain
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
two three four five apartments
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
and those units are more affordable
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
for a person to live in than buying a
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
single family home in fact in dover
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
single-family homes are
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
the median price now is over five
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars for a single
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
now in my
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony i provided a link
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
to a study that was done by saint
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
anselm's university recently
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
to try to uncover
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
unaffordable housing in new hampshire
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
and if you read that study or took a
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
quick look at that study one of the
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
things one of the things that reveals is
 
01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.590 align:start position:0%
things one of the things that reveals is
that

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
heavy duty land used regulation
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
is one of the causes of our lack of
 
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
affordable housing in this state we have
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
driven up
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
through land use regulations
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
the cost of housing all across the state
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
but especially in the most populated
 
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
counties like rockingham and
 
01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:41.590 align:start position:0%
counties like rockingham and
hillsborough

01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
so i have filed this bill in an attempt
 
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
to chip away at some of the
 
01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.950 align:start position:0%
to chip away at some of the
regulation

01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
that is inhibiting the development of
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
now the bill i submitted
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
initially or the bill as introduced
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
i will concede is somewhat vague
 
01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:05.990 align:start position:0%
i will concede is somewhat vague
and

01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
amends the
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
workforce housing general provisions for
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
planning and zoning
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
declaration of purpose to say that
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
you can't prohibit workforce housing
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
in any defined zone well that's kind of
 
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.630 align:start position:0%
in any defined zone well that's kind of
vague

01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
vague
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
i admit so i have prepared an amendment
 
01:11:34.719 --> 01:11:35.830 align:start position:0%
i admit so i have prepared an amendment
that

01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
addresses this issue
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
it um
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
clarifies exactly what i mean
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
and would like to accomplish and i'm
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
going to pass out
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh this amendment so you can all take a
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
look at it and i would like to discuss
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
it discuss it if that's okay with the
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
chairman yes we can discuss it but we're
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
not going to take a vote on it until we
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
go to executive session understood
 
01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:00.870 align:start position:0%
go to executive session understood
understood

01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
understood
 
01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.990 align:start position:0%
understood
so

01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you to representative power for
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
passing out the copies of the amendment
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you to representative power
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
who made a couple of suggestions uh to
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
me as i was
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
thinking about preparing this amendment
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
and her suggestions were incredibly
 
01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.950 align:start position:0%
and her suggestions were incredibly
helpful

01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
so what i've done in the amendment is
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
i've spelled out
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
well what exactly are we talking about
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
so the language now says
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
that it would be
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
you would be prohibited
 
01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.030 align:start position:0%
you would be prohibited
uh

01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
on the building of
 
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
or you would be prevented from
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
putting into your land use zoning
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
requirements prohibitions on the
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
building of multi-family dwelling units
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
in residential or non-residential zones
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
that spells it out
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
spells out what is an affordable unit
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
and where it could
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
or could not go and by
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
using the language residential or
 
01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
non-residential that basically means you
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
can go anywhere
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
and then to give the
 
01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
i've also added a
 
01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.149 align:start position:0%
i've also added a
uh

01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
a similar phrase
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
innovative land use control
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
section of statute
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
to provide an incentive for people to
 
01:13:38.159 --> 01:13:39.350 align:start position:0%
to provide an incentive for people to
actually

01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.790 align:start position:0%
actually
consider

01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
so this amendment i think significantly
 
01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
strengthens the bill
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
makes it
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
more understandable
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
as well as gives it some teeth
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
so this bill hb 1238 is basically a
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
modest expansion of rsa 672
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
it chips away but a little bit of the
 
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
heavy duty regulation to which we
 
01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.510 align:start position:0%
heavy duty regulation to which we
subject

01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
subject
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
and it may be one small
 
01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.590 align:start position:0%
and it may be one small
step

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
step
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
toward helping us provide more
 
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
affordable energy of affordable housing
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
with that i think i'll i'll conclude my
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
testimony and i'd be happy to answer any
 
01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.070 align:start position:0%
testimony and i'd be happy to answer any
questions

01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative votes do you have
 
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
already assigned the the amendment to
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
anyone in particular to complete that
 
01:14:47.189 --> 01:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to probably
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
execute this bill
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
i'd say the middle of next week
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh i was hoping that representative
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
power would take that on but i can't
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you mr chair
 
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.510 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you mr chair
so

01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
this is a process question
 
01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.030 align:start position:0%
this is a process question
and

01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that representative vose
 
01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.310 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that representative vose
has

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
submitted this amendment
 
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
i guess prior or during the hearing
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
does he need another co-sponsor
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
no no
 
01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.470 align:start position:0%
no no
okay

01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh questions from the committee yes
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative vann
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative vos for taking my
 
01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
question um i
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh am curious about this amendment to a
 
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
section 3e
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
where you say not limited to
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
provided that such units meet all other
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
applicable standards
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
the issue i am asking about is
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
lots of and i'm sure epping is the same
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
way a great deal of your residential
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
area is zoned single-family only so are
 
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
you assuming that that's a standard
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
because typically i don't think we would
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
what i was referring to
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
by applicable standards are essentially
 
01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances that affect parking
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
lot size
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
that type of thing not anything having
 
01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
to do with
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
what's applicable to the zone
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
in total but applicable to building
 
01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.430 align:start position:0%
in total but applicable to building
units

01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
units
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
can you tell me how much of eppings
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
residential area is zoned single family
 
01:16:46.159 --> 01:16:48.950 align:start position:0%
residential area is zoned single family
only

01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
i couldn't give you an exact percentage
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
but i'd say it's close to 70 percent
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up so i'm not sure can
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
you explain to me how this is going to
 
01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:00.390 align:start position:0%
you explain to me how this is going to
help

01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
if 70 is single family only and this
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
does not address that issue
 
01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.229 align:start position:0%
does not address that issue
uh

01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
what's your anticipation here
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
well i think it does address the issue
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
because it gives an incentive
 
01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.149 align:start position:0%
because it gives an incentive
to

01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:14.159 --> 01:17:14.830 align:start position:0%
to
a

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
builder if he so desires to build an
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
apartment unit in a residential zone
 
01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:22.390 align:start position:0%
apartment unit in a residential zone
and

01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
he could also build an apartment
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
building in a non-residential zone
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's a property rights issue if someone
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
owns property
 
01:17:30.719 --> 01:17:31.830 align:start position:0%
owns property
and

01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
they decide they want to sell it to
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
someone who wants to build an apartment
 
01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.149 align:start position:0%
someone who wants to build an apartment
building

01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative matchapootie
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:17:48.719 --> 01:17:50.550 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
my question is you have added in your
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
amendment the inclusionary zoning
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
and which
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
some communities have
 
01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.350 align:start position:0%
some communities have
adopted

01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
and it only applies to
 
01:18:06.719 --> 01:18:08.070 align:start position:0%
and it only applies to
15

01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
of a new development that they can um
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
ask for a multi-family
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
still does not address like my colleague
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
just asked about
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
zoning in terms of single-family homes
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
and the developer can own
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
somebody owning a land to put up
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
the local ordnance local zoning
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
has to work with
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
the developer just by owning a piece of
 
01:18:39.679 --> 01:18:40.550 align:start position:0%
the developer just by owning a piece of
land

01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
land
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
you still have to abide by what's
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
currently in existence
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
this does not
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
give much change to that
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
well as i said in my
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
representative as i said in my uh
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
original testimony this is a a bill that
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
chips away at land use regulation it's
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
but i'm hopeful that it will
 
01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.590 align:start position:0%
but i'm hopeful that it will
prod

01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
prod
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
local communities as they craft
 
01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:15.990 align:start position:0%
local communities as they craft
future

01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
land use regulations
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
to consider the possibility
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
that affordable housing needs to be
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
accommodated in a better way than we do
 
01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.070 align:start position:0%
accommodated in a better way than we do
today

01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not entirely certain
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what you were asking uh if you
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
could clarify a little bit maybe i can
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
give you a better answer
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
this will only enhance a large developer
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
or support a
 
01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:47.910 align:start position:0%
or support a
landowner

01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
landowner
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of developing i just have a
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
single family home with a modest
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
air you know it doesn't help
 
01:19:58.630 --> 01:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
somebody if i'm willing to do expand on
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
my single family lot
 
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't give me a whole lot of um
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.310 align:start position:0%
to do that
currently

01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification yes uh
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
it is an incentive it's not a not a
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
mandate certainly
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's just an incentive to a developer
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to to consider
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
putting an affordable housing unit on a
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
piece of of property
 
01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:27.990 align:start position:0%
piece of of property
now

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
existing regulations that are in effect
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
would still apply so for example
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
if you live in a single family home and
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
there's a empty lot next door to you and
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
somebody buys it and wants to put up a
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
multi-family home you're in a butter and
 
01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.550 align:start position:0%
multi-family home you're in a butter and
so

01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
you can still make objections
 
01:20:45.679 --> 01:20:46.709 align:start position:0%
you can still make objections
to

01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
the planning board or other local
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
planning organization
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
when that site plan is originally
 
01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.390 align:start position:0%
when that site plan is originally
offered

01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
offered
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
and if there are a sufficient number of
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
a butter objections
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
then the
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
planning board or other organization
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
would have to make a decision about
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
whether to go forward with that or not
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
that would still be the case
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
even though we've provided in this in
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation an incentive
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
for developers to consider
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
a multi-flam multi-family dwelling unit
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
in a residential
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
or even other zone
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
industrial commercial for example
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
we had a case in epping
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
where we have a a zone that's
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
industrial commercial and someone came
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
in and proposed a 315 unit apartment
 
01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.709 align:start position:0%
in and proposed a 315 unit apartment
building

01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:21:38.719 --> 01:21:39.510 align:start position:0%
building
and

01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
there is a federal law that says if 20
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
percent of such a
 
01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:44.790 align:start position:0%
percent of such a
a

01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
development is workforce housing then
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's allowed in a commercial industrial
 
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.110 align:start position:0%
it's allowed in a commercial industrial
zone

01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
zone
 
01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.149 align:start position:0%
zone
so

01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
this would
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
this bill would reinforce that federal
 
01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:01.750 align:start position:0%
this bill would reinforce that federal
legislation

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay if there are no further questions
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
and first we'll have
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
mr pollock
 
01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:33.669 align:start position:0%
mr pollock
yes

01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.679 --> 01:22:34.950 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning i'm ari pollock
 
01:22:38.629 --> 01:22:38.639 align:start position:0%
i'm with the law firm of gallagher
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
callahan and gartrell
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me here in concord i've been a
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
land use lawyer for about 25 years
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
still hard to hear myself say that
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
but i'm also a lobbyist for the new
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire home builders and we're here
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
today to support the bill
 
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
frankly we support any well-intentioned
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
effort to develop additional housing and
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
in particular workforce housing
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
our members build housing it's no
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
surprise we want to build more but we
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
also rely upon and require
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
a workforce and a labor force and it's
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
becoming an increasing struggle to find
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
people who are able to work for our
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
members who have those skills who have
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
the ability to to live near where they
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
work and afford housing where they work
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
and so we're not only building for
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
customers we're building for ourselves
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
we're building for our workforce
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
and we're building for the state
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
we support therefore the diversity of
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
housing stock not everyone wants not
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
everyone can afford a single-family home
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
and workforce housing and multi-family
 
01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:39.750 align:start position:0%
and workforce housing and multi-family
housing

01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
serve some of those needs
 
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
this bill helps it may be a small step
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor explained and frankly i
 
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
view this from a legal perspective of
 
01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
putting another thumb on the scale when
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
a case involving workforce housing or
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
multi-family housing or inclusionary
 
01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:57.990 align:start position:0%
multi-family housing or inclusionary
zoning

01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
reaches the courthouse and a judge has
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
to decide whether or not a community has
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
acted fairly reviewed things fairly
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
whether they're rejecting a proposal
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
because of the merits of the proposal or
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
whether they're rejecting a proposal
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
because of the population served by the
 
01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.430 align:start position:0%
because of the population served by the
proposal

01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
i think those are critical
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
distinctions to be made when housing
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
projects come through
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
and so we're just looking at the
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill this morning like
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of you but it all appears to be
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
a well-intentioned effort to open up
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
more opportunity for housing in new
 
01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.030 align:start position:0%
more opportunity for housing in new
hampshire

01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's amending a statute that's already
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
on the books a statement of purpose
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
that's already on the books
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
and a statement of purpose that's
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
already been tested in court on multiple
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
occasions and frankly can use all the
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
support that it can get so we're here to
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
briefly explain our support uh for the
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
concept behind the bill and to thank the
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor for putting it forward
 
01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.510 align:start position:0%
sponsor for putting it forward
questions

01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.030 align:start position:0%
questions
yes

01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
my question um
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
how would you characterize this is like
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
i asked the priya the prime sponsor
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
does this only support landowners in the
 
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
developers or
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
is there a counter that can also
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
facilitate small
 
01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.350 align:start position:0%
facilitate small
independent

01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
independent
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
single-family homeowners that can
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
create multi-dwelling units on the
 
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
currently existing
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's a difficult question to answer
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
based on the language i see in the bill
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
as introduced and in the amendment i
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
think certainly the intention is to
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
provide support for both of those
 
01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.510 align:start position:0%
provide support for both of those
scenarios

01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
scenarios
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
and i know
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
the inclusionary zoning portion for
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
example in 674-21
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's enabling language that the state
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
is providing to municipalities to enact
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
those types of ordinances it could only
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
help in those circumstances so i think
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
it would be both
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
follow up yes
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:01.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
is my understanding correct
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
that it's enabling currently focused on
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
multiple you know the large developer
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
but not
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
independent except for the inclusionary
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
zone that we see in
 
01:26:16.239 --> 01:26:17.430 align:start position:0%
zone that we see in
our

01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
amendment most ordinances define
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
multifamily as three units or more so it
 
01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
does not need to be a particularly large
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
development project to be classified as
 
01:26:29.110 --> 01:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
multi-family i think people hear the
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
phrase multi-family and they think large
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
rental apartments in a large complex
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
with multiple buildings that that is
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
that is rarely the case in the more
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
rural parts of the state so i think it
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
could very easily benefit either a
 
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
private landowner or a private developer
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
not a corporate entity
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up mister
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
one more okay thank you so how would
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
this address the crisis or the need for
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
missing middle
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
housing in our state
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
i think a number of these projects are
 
01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged at the local level because
 
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
of the notion that they're bringing in
 
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
folks from outside of the community who
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
of the higher income levels
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
i think this fills that middle by
 
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
providing some more support for those
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
projects if and when they reach the
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
courthouse and the reasons for the
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
treatment at the local level are
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
explored whether you want to talk about
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board the superior
 
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
court there are forums where these the
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
rationale of the local boards is
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
examined and this type of language is
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
very helpful in figuring out whether or
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.310 align:start position:0%
yes
gilman

01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
gilman
 
01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:27:47.189 --> 01:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
do you have any concerns about the
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
about including non-residential zones
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
and the mixture of perhaps
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
light industrial or industrial
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
businesses with uh with dwelling units i
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
would have concerned in terms of mixture
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
of uses if the language behind it wasn't
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
also provided which is meeting
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
applicable other other applicable
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
standards i think that modifies the
 
01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.550 align:start position:0%
standards i think that modifies the
concern

01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.830 align:start position:0%
concern
yes

01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:18.870 align:start position:0%
yes
representative

01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh thank you for taking my
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
question i'm over here there you are
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
i represent uh
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
the town of litchfield which has
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming majority of the town is
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
single-family housing but we do have
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
over 55 housing which is
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
i assume that the requirement is that
 
01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.070 align:start position:0%
i assume that the requirement is that
you're

01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
you're over 55 and you don't have young
 
01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:51.590 align:start position:0%
you're over 55 and you don't have young
children

01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
and and that's fine for those people
 
01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:55.669 align:start position:0%
and and that's fine for those people
but

01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
why couldn't we have housing
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
similar to over 55 communities
 
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
for instance under 40.
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
right so the over 55
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
category over 62 category those are
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
essentially legally discriminatory
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
practices it's a it's a specialized
 
01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
recognized um subset of elderly and
 
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
there is no prohibition against having
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
children in those developments it's just
 
01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
less likely because of the age group of
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
the owners uh and so
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know having something that says uh
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know for under 40
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
that that would be discriminatory in a
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
way that has not been recognized as
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
legal it's well beyond my pay grade to
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
to decide whether we should or shouldn't
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
have it but there's the distinction
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions for
 
01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.870 align:start position:0%
any further questions for
mr

01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
mr
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
i think there's one here
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.910 align:start position:0%
taking my question
uh

01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
with regards to the other applicable
 
01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:07.510 align:start position:0%
with regards to the other applicable
standards

01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:08.870 align:start position:0%
standards
uh

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
could you give me some examples of uh
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
what these other applicable standards
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
yes that was a good question asked
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
previously of the sponsor and as i
 
01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
understood his answer it was things that
 
01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
i would consider to be in the category
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
of dimensional requirements do you meet
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
setbacks do you have proper parking
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
loading can you achieve the proper
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
loading for whether it's an on-site
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
septic system or does the sewer capacity
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh achieve the project's needs um things
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
of a of a more technical nature
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
than what i would call of a use nature
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome
 
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%

my pleasure thank you for having me
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
next we're going to hear from
 
01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:07.430 align:start position:0%
next we're going to hear from
nhma

01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and h grace for the
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association i
 
01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
actually get to support this bill
 
01:31:14.239 --> 01:31:15.030 align:start position:0%
actually get to support this bill
we

01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
nhma does have a policy that recognizes
 
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
the need for diverse and affordable
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
housing in new hampshire and we support
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that allows municipalities
 
01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.750 align:start position:0%
legislation that allows municipalities
to

01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
require the inclusion of affordable and
 
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
diverse housing
 
01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
opportunities as part of new housing
 
01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
developments i think as was described in
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
previous testimony this provides further
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
incentive for municipalities to look at
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
what they're doing look at their zoning
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
codes and provide more opportunities for
 
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and that's why we
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
support it i'm happy to answer any
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
questions that committee members may
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
have yes representative
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr greece
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question same question i
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
asked the previous
 
01:31:54.239 --> 01:31:56.550 align:start position:0%
asked the previous
speaker

01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
how would you characterize
 
01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:00.070 align:start position:0%
how would you characterize
this

01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.189 align:start position:0%
this
bill

01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
with other bills that are in our
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
committee to help with increasing the
 
01:32:06.159 --> 01:32:08.229 align:start position:0%
committee to help with increasing the
densities

01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
densities
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
that would help
 
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
individual homeowners increase the
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not sure exactly how it help
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
individual homeowners i would say as far
 
01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.830 align:start position:0%
individual homeowners i would say as far
as

01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
asking municipalities to look at
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
increasing density opportunities in
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
their zoning
 
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
this certainly
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
bolsters what the legislature already
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
has an effect
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
to say this is something that they want
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities to look at
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
especially with that missing middle
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
um as mr pollock indicated uh the
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
multi-family is often defined as as
 
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
three units or or more so it's possible
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
that could help uh help that type of
 
01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:58.149 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
mr grays
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
i thought that nhma opposed all
 
01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
statewide zoning ordinances does this
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
not require places to allow multi-family
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
in places that they don't now can you
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
explain to me uh in hma's change of
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
heart we we do oppose all state-wide
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
zoning mandates but we we also uh
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
because an innovative land use control
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
is a local option not a mandate it would
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
be something adopted at the local level
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore we would be able to
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
support it
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
in in conjunction with our policy on
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
housing opportunities
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
so this only applies to communities that
 
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
have adopted
 
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.189 align:start position:0%
have adopted
uh

01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
innovative land use policies
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
correct under the statute correct so it
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
would have to it's a it's a local option
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
okay great thanks
 
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh any
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
final questions for the nhma
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:00.550 align:start position:0%
thank you
thanks

01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to close the hearing on
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i do have one more speaker
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to close the hearing
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
 
01:34:25.679 --> 01:34:26.709 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
committee

01:34:26.709 --> 01:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:34:26.719 --> 01:34:29.110 align:start position:0%
committee
um

01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
this bill strengthens the state's
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
workforce housing law by preventing
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
local governments from prohibiting
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
workforce housing development in any
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
district that meets other applicable
 
01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:40.950 align:start position:0%
district that meets other applicable
standards

01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
presumably including life safety codes
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
it is unclear how stringently this law
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
would be interpreted and its literal
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation and this is talking about
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
not the amendment haven't had time to
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
review the amendment
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
and its literal interpretation
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
the new law could represent a massive
 
01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
statewide deregulation of housing
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
in which every single district
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
must allow affordable housing to be
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
built over the state's entire territory
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
but the law could be interpreted
 
01:35:11.119 --> 01:35:12.229 align:start position:0%
but the law could be interpreted
narrowly

01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
narrowly
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
simply making the existing requirement
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
that every municipality must provide at
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
least one pathway to building workforce
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
housing more explicit
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
without explicit preemption of lot sizes
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
setbacks floor area ratios parking
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
minimums minimum house sizes and so on
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities could probably find a way
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
to evade this
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
as they already are doing
 
01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:40.629 align:start position:0%
as they already are doing
so

01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh in any event it does end up
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
being a local control sort of local
 
01:35:46.239 --> 01:35:47.430 align:start position:0%
being a local control sort of local
option

01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:48.629 align:start position:0%
option
um

01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:48.639 --> 01:35:49.510 align:start position:0%
um
thing

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.629 align:start position:0%
thing
uh

01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
again not considering
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh what
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
changes the amendment uh would have on
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
this bill so i just encourage the
 
01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:02.070 align:start position:0%

01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
of 16 people
 
01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.470 align:start position:0%
of 16 people

01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
those opposing with zero
 
01:36:43.679 --> 01:36:44.790 align:start position:0%
those opposing with zero
so

01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to close the hearing now on
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 1238
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
and open a hearing
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman my name is
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative david muse
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
i am here
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
in place of the sponsor of this bill
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative nicole klein knight
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
and thank you for giving me an
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh to present this bill
 
01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
to you i know this is something you
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
folks have seen before i hope the
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
approach that we're taking this time is
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
something that can meet with your
 
01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:45.669 align:start position:0%
something that can meet with your
approval

01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
approval
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
what the bill would essentially do is to
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
allow new hampshire cities and towns to
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
regulate the distribution of single-use
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
plastic bags
 
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
to their customers
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
as they see fit
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
and that's basically it
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
this is not a plastic bags ban this is
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
not a tax on plastic bags this
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
essentially says
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
that if your community and this is an
 
01:38:09.679 --> 01:38:10.550 align:start position:0%
that if your community and this is an
issue

01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
for the people in your town or the
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
people in your city
 
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
you have the ability under new hampshire
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
law to pass regulations that would
 
01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:20.070 align:start position:0%
law to pass regulations that would
impact

01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
the distribution of single-use plastic
 
01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:24.390 align:start position:0%
the distribution of single-use plastic
bags

01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
bags
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
the bill as it's written would amend the
 
01:38:29.830 --> 01:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
municipal ordinance statute that's rsa
 
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
31 colon 39
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
to include a new provision
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
related to single-use plastic bags
 
01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
and again what it would do is it would
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
give municipalities the option of doing
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
this uh it is not a mandate uh it is not
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
a requirement
 
01:38:47.679 --> 01:38:48.950 align:start position:0%
a requirement
um

01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
one of the big issues with uh with
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic bags and a lot of
 
01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:55.910 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic bags and a lot of
plastic

01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
plastic
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
plastic materials that are put out into
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
our environment these days
 
01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
they are many times billed as being
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
recycled recyclable
 
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
but the simple truth is is that they are
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
really designed to be disposable and the
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
vast majority of people
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
simply dispose of them
 
01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
and this is why they wind up in our
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
landfills they wind up on the side of
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
the road they wind up as litter
 
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
they wind up along beaches in places
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
like portsmouth where i and seabrook
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
so this is a this is an issue uh that in
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
a maybe in a small way
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
we can begin doing something uh to
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh to help the environment a bit
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
the other thing i think that sometimes
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
flies under the radar a little bit with
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
plastic bags is they are made from
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that continually
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
churning out an endless supply of
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
plastic bags and plastic materials does
 
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
is it actually makes
 
01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
the climate problem that we have just a
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
little bit worse
 
01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:01.669 align:start position:0%
little bit worse
so

01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
this is a proposal that a lot of people
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
have been behind
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh for many years i know there have been
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
several attempts to get various uh
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
versions of this
 
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
through the legislature
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
this would simply give communities
 
01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
like mine the ability
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
to regulate single-use plastic bags
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
without having to worry uh
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
any longer about whether or not that's
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
something that is permissible under
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
state law
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
and i can take any questions any
 
01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
all questions yes representative
 
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
in the seacoast and the
 
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
communities that attract a lot of
 
01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.310 align:start position:0%
communities that attract a lot of
tourists

01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
tourists
 
01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:53.430 align:start position:0%
tourists
and

01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
during summer and the population
 
01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:56.870 align:start position:0%
during summer and the population
fluctuates

01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
fluctuates
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
how would this help
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
those small communities to deal with
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:06.239 --> 01:41:07.189 align:start position:0%
 
benefit

01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
it helps them by having less of plastic
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
waste to deal with i think that's really
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
the the intent of the bill
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
so part of what this bill could do
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
depending on how different
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities implement it
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
is it could begin to
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
constrict the supply or the amount of
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
this material that actually goes out
 
01:41:26.639 --> 01:41:27.669 align:start position:0%
this material that actually goes out
into

01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh into the world
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
from stores from businesses and places
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
there are many different options that
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
communities have for doing this and
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you can do is you
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
can just google municipal plastic bag
 
01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.430 align:start position:0%
can just google municipal plastic bag
bans

01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
bans
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
and what it'll do is it'll take you to
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
pages where you can see
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
state laws that are that have either
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
banned them or restricted them in some
 
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
way you can see municipalities um it's
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
dozens of states at this point and and
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
it's hundreds of municipalities so this
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
is something that is happening
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
across the country and it would be
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh it would be a good thing if our
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
communities had the option to do this
 
01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:09.910 align:start position:0%
communities had the option to do this
and

01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
my community in portsmouth we have kind
 
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:15.679 align:start position:0%
of come up against this several times
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
we have a very active high school
 
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
environmental club
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
that over the years has uh
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
has proposed this to our city council
 
01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
portsmouth is actually the the only
 
01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:27.510 align:start position:0%
portsmouth is actually the the only
state

01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire or the only city in new
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire right now
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
that actually
 
01:42:34.390 --> 01:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
has any kind of
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
regulations or restrictions on
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
on styrofoam
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
and on a
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
plastic uh single-use plastic
 
01:42:42.639 --> 01:42:44.070 align:start position:0%
plastic uh single-use plastic
disposables

01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
disposables
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
those particular regulations have been
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
written with the knowledge that the
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
state uh you know that this is not
 
01:42:53.679 --> 01:42:54.709 align:start position:0%
state uh you know that this is not
something

01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
01:42:59.669 --> 01:42:59.679 align:start position:0%
there isn't blanket permission to do
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
this across the board
 
01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:02.550 align:start position:0%
this across the board
however

01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
our council
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
was confident that new hampshire's
 
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
municipal waste laws uh do allow for
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
some of the things that have been done
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
so for instance
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
portsmouth's ordinance is not a total
 
01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:15.830 align:start position:0%
portsmouth's ordinance is not a total
ban

01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
ban
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that portsmouth
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
ordinance does
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
is it restricts uh the distribution of
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
us things like styrofoam containers and
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
single-use disposables on city property
 
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
there are um
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that
 
01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.709 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that
um

01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
there is also
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
another ordinance that restricts the
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
distribution of styrofoam containers
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things that just sort
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
of happened in our experience
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of this this a lot of this
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
coincided with the cobit period
 
01:43:51.669 --> 01:43:51.679 align:start position:0%
and so a lot of restaurants and
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
businesses that normally use these
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
materials were really kind of taking a
 
01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
second look at this you know they wanted
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
something that was environmentally sound
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
they wanted something that was cost
 
01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:02.950 align:start position:0%
they wanted something that was cost
effective

01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
effective
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
and where a lot of a lot of them have
 
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
landed as they've landed on paper
 
01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:07.910 align:start position:0%
landed as they've landed on paper
products

01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
and they've also landed on
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
on things that are
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
recyclable so one of the problems with
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
both plastic bags
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
and with styrofoam is neither one of
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
them is recyclable
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
and a big problem with plastic bags in
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
particular is that if people put them in
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
their recycle bins and you see that a
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
lot if you have newspapers and a lot of
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
people will look for something to put
 
01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
the newspapers in
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
those those plastic bags can actually
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
follow up recycling equipment and that
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
can actually add costs for
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities and it can there can be
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
extra costs
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
to sort through
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
material that has a lot of plastic bags
 
01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
in it and things like that
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
so for a lot of reasons
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
it makes sense
 
01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:54.390 align:start position:0%
it makes sense
to

01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
let communities chart their own path
 
01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this depending on
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
things like the extent of their
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
recycling programs depending on things
 
01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:02.709 align:start position:0%
recycling programs depending on things
like

01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
are they in a tourist area where you're
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to have you know beaches and
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
recreation and where you know having
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
this this litter would be an issue um
 
01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:12.229 align:start position:0%
this this litter would be an issue um
uh

01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
in portsmouth we have hundreds and
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
hundreds of restaurants we have a lot of
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of supermarkets we
 
01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:19.750 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of supermarkets we
generate

01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
generate
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of disposable material and this is
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
a way of just sort of helping us start
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
to get a handle on the amount of waste
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
that we generate
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
and the amount of waste that we put into
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
before we go to the follow-ups we have a
 
01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
whole slew of people who want to speak
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
on this so i'll come back to you for a
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up later
 
01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:46.229 align:start position:0%
follow-up later
um

01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.239 --> 01:45:47.270 align:start position:0%
 
mr

01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%

leave
 
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcdonald had a
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:09.830 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
representative

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
i know some of the communities in
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
massachusetts have
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
adopted similar policies that you want
 
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
to adopt in the state of new hampshire
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
there have been many failures in those
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
communities confusion to the public
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know do i get a plastic bag don't
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
get a plastic bag
 
01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to figure out how you're
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
going to determine that we don't have
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
those same failures in new hampshire
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry we don't have what in new
 
01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire the same failures that
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
massachusetts has had in some of the
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
communities where some communities adopt
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
a policy of yes we take plastic bags
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
others no we don't
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
well part of
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
i think part of
 
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
part of the reason for this bill and and
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we went through
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
in portsmouth is this wasn't just
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
something that was proposed one night
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
and everybody agreed to it
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
this is something that's been debated
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
over a period of many years in
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
portsmouth so i think
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
at least three or four years that i'm
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
it was proposed in several forums shot
 
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
down in several forums and finally it
 
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
was passed
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
but it was passed with a lot of local
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
debate and it was passed with a lot of
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
local input
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that was part of
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
our debate were
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
local issues
 
01:47:23.109 --> 01:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
you know i'll give you an example um in
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
doing things like banning styrofoam from
 
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
city locations to put food in
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
um there were people who were very
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
folks who may have bought supplies
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
of of styrofoam containers and who had a
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
lot of them on hand
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
they're not cheap
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
so there's an exception and there was an
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
exception in the local in the local
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
ordinance that allows people
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
who who did buy stocks to use those to
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
use those stocks up
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
um there were other exceptions for
 
01:47:58.390 --> 01:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
non-profit groups who who rent out city
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
facilities and things like that
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
so i think one of the things that we
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
found is that at a local level
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
we can be very much in tune
 
01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
with with local concerns and i'm not
 
01:48:10.709 --> 01:48:10.719 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
you know we're doing it perfectly i
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
think we're sort of going along and sort
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
of seeing how things work and people are
 
01:48:18.629 --> 01:48:18.639 align:start position:0%
probably fully expecting to have to
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
tweak it at some point way down the road
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
but having the flexibility to do that
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
and not having to deal with you know
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
a one-size-fits-all mandate imposed from
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
which is something that that could come
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
i think would tend to work better for a
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
lot of communities in new hampshire just
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
because of the independence that you
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your explanation uh
 
01:48:48.149 --> 01:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
regulating is a very broad word
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
and couldn't if this was approved
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't a
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
community say okay we're going to keep
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
plastic bags we're going to make
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
everyone pay 10 cents a bag if they want
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
to use one
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
well you could i mean you know
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
essentially the bill is yours now so you
 
01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
can do whatever you want to it but the
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
reason for keeping it broad uh was to
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
really just give municipalities uh the
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of flexibility uh to
 
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
enact regulations that
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
really meet the needs of their citizens
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of their situation
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
not everyone is going to want to charge
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
for them
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
there are also debates about where the
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
money goes
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
does it go to our community recycling
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
program does it go back to
 
01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:29.910 align:start position:0%
program does it go back to
the

01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
the the restaurant owners and merchants
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
and you know where does that 10 cents go
 
01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:36.950 align:start position:0%
and you know where does that 10 cents go
so

01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:38.629 --> 01:49:38.639 align:start position:0%
one of the things i think sometimes is
 
01:49:38.639 --> 01:49:39.430 align:start position:0%
one of the things i think sometimes is
that

01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:40.550 align:start position:0%
that
we

01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
you know we we try to solve all the
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
stage problems up here at the state
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
house um when there are people who are
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
perfectly capable of solving problems
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
for their communities in those
 
01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:51.109 align:start position:0%
for their communities in those
communities

01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:49:51.119 --> 01:49:51.990 align:start position:0%
communities
and

01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
what we're really just trying to do here
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
is to let them do
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
what people in local communities elected
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
them to do
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you
 
01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:01.910 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you
representative

01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:50:05.589 --> 01:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.629 --> 01:50:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative for taking a follow-up
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
um single-use plastics
 
01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
would also
 
01:50:17.119 --> 01:50:19.189 align:start position:0%
would also
um

01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
enhance or
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
help with more recycling better
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
recycling and a locally produced
 
01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:30.550 align:start position:0%
recycling and a locally produced
reusable

01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
reusable
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
i mean recycled product from the
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic versus mixed-use
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
recycling stream which can
 
01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh the single-use plastic can
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
pollute or
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
i don't want to use the word corrupt but
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
it kind of could reject the whole bug
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i'm not sure i understood
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
you okay let me
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
phrase the question it's in so many
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
broad sections
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
um single-use plastic this providing
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to separate and
 
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic will also wouldn't it
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
also help with
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
doing a recycle recyclable product for
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
example in vermont they do the
 
01:51:17.119 --> 01:51:18.149 align:start position:0%
example in vermont they do the
chairs

01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
chairs
 
01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh plastic chairs the adirondack chairs
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
using the single-use plastic
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
similarly but if it is mixed in with a
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
multi-stream or mixed stream
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
it can reject the whole stream because
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
of the single use yes and and one one of
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
the things that that this that you know
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
one of the impacts that legislation like
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
this could have is it could allow
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
communities to actually kind of clean up
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
their recycling streams a little bit
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
um so a lot of disposables uh that
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
aren't recyclable wind up in in in
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
recycling streams and that costs
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities extra money
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
um and i think as we all know recycling
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
programs these days are not uh are not
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
inexpensive there's a there's a
 
01:52:03.669 --> 01:52:03.679 align:start position:0%
significant cost to having one of those
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
and a lot of our communities we but we
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
still we still uh we still do want them
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
so if you have fewer fewer disposables
 
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
following up your your recyclables and
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
then when
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
when restaurants and and when business
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
owners do provide single-use plastics
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
they provide them in a form that that is
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
recyclable um you know that that's
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
again can
 
01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
what do you
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
think will it will be
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
an alternative
 
01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
let's say a grocery store
 
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
if they prohibited single-use plastic
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
and paper bags
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
what would they use
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
i think i think there are grocery stores
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
now that provide uh that provide paper
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
bags so um
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
trader joe's i think is one grocery
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
store in portsmouth they no longer
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
they no longer give out plastic bags at
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
all um all of the bags that they uh
 
01:53:17.669 --> 01:53:17.679 align:start position:0%
that they give out when customers come
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
into the store and buy things are paper
 
01:53:20.239 --> 01:53:21.189 align:start position:0%
into the store and buy things are paper
um

01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:21.199 --> 01:53:22.310 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are also bringing in
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
their own uh
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
permanent bags yep like you've got right
 
01:53:28.159 --> 01:53:29.589 align:start position:0%
permanent bags yep like you've got right
there

01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
i have four of them out in my car right
 
01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
now i use them every time i go grocery
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
shopping although sometimes i do forget
 
01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:37.679 align:start position:0%
i think everybody forgets
 
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
but the um
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
but the issue you know
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things i do want to say is is
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
i think that some of the grocery stores
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
we have in new hampshire like market
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
basket are to be commended
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
because they have made it
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
a lot easier for people to bring their
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
used bags back into the the supermarket
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
so they can be properly disposed of and
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully recycled
 
01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:01.750 align:start position:0%
hopefully recycled
um

01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
but but again that's only a very very
 
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
small percentage of of the bags that
 
01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:09.109 align:start position:0%
small percentage of of the bags that
actually

01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
leave a store like that like that so
 
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
only a very very small percentage
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
actually come back and get recycled
 
01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:20.470 align:start position:0%
actually come back and get recycled
follow-up

01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking uh my follow-up
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
has language that says they can regulate
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
the distribution of single-use plastic
 
01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:36.310 align:start position:0%
the distribution of single-use plastic
or

01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:37.510 align:start position:0%
or
and

01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:38.950 --> 01:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
paper bags
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
so a grocery store
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
would not be able to offer
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
plastic or paper so they would have to
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
offer something like this or something
 
01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:52.709 align:start position:0%
offer something like this or something
else

01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
well there's actually no requirement in
 
01:54:56.550 --> 01:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
the law as is written for a grocery
 
01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
store to do anything unless a
 
01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
municipality tells them that they have
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
to do something differently
 
01:55:04.149 --> 01:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
but the reason for paper bags is that
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
paper bags are a lot of times are put
 
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
out there as an alternative so for
 
01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
instance there are some communities that
 
01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:12.390 align:start position:0%
instance there are some communities that
say

01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh we don't want you to uh to distribute
 
01:55:17.669 --> 01:55:17.679 align:start position:0%
plastic bags anymore instead
 
01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
we would like you to offer paper bags
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
and and charge people ten cents a bag or
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
five cents a bag or or whatever uh
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
whatever that the community thinks is uh
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
is fair
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh the idea is to really
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
is to really change behavior um
 
01:55:38.070 --> 01:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
the the plastic bags as they now stand
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
they're just
 
01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
amazingly convenient for a lot of people
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
we've grown used to something that 20
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
years ago we didn't necessarily have
 
01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:48.870 align:start position:0%
years ago we didn't necessarily have
um

01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:51.189 --> 01:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
and uh and and i think a lot of people
 
01:55:54.149 --> 01:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
do appreciate the convenience um
 
01:55:54.159 --> 01:55:55.270 align:start position:0%
do appreciate the convenience um
but

01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
the convenience comes at a cost you know
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
to our recycling programs to our
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
landfills and to the natural beauty of
 
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:04.719 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
sort of why we're
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
we're we're doing this and and i and i
 
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
would stress that
 
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know we're not trying to design
 
01:56:16.709 --> 01:56:16.719 align:start position:0%
you know the regulations here in this
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
committee right now unless the committee
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
decides that's where they want to go
 
01:56:23.189 --> 01:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
you know this really is about just
 
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
basically said telling municipalities
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
that if you want to do this
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative gallagher
 
01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:34.550 align:start position:0%
yes representative gallagher
so

01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
to kind of um
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
rephrase the previous question in a
 
01:56:42.629 --> 01:56:42.639 align:start position:0%
different way would you
 
01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
support an amendment that would change
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
plastic bags and paper bags to say
 
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
plastic bags or paper bags to change the
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
and to ore
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
or does it have to be
 
01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that i think your your
 
01:56:59.109 --> 01:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
suggestion is probably a little more
 
01:56:59.119 --> 01:57:00.229 align:start position:0%
suggestion is probably a little more
precise

01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
precise
 
01:57:00.239 --> 01:57:01.189 align:start position:0%
precise
um

01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
again the i think the only reason paper
 
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
is in there
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
is in situations where a community might
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:09.270 align:start position:0%
want to
um

01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
to have paper bags be your preferred
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
alternative to plastic it's
 
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
basically there could be somebody who
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
comes out and says wait a minute the
 
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
legislature never gave you authority to
 
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
regulate paper bags
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
so part of part of it is try is just
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get around that issue and the
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
other thing is
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
um plastic bags are the only
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
single-use disposable uh that are
 
01:57:35.189 --> 01:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
covered under this legislation
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
so it it's it's very narrow
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative did you have a question
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that you uh you read
 
01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:53.030 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that you uh you read
the

01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
bill to say
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic bags and paper bags
 
01:58:00.070 --> 01:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
but you flavored bags are not considered
 
01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:01.430 align:start position:0%
but you flavored bags are not considered
single-use

01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
single-use
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:58:05.189 --> 01:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
oh sorry paper bags are not considered
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
they are considered single use the the
 
01:58:14.149 --> 01:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
quite as destructive and long lasting in
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
the environment as plastic bags
 
01:58:22.229 --> 01:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
i think the ideal solution would be uh
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
for people to bring in their own bags
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
and and that that's actually something
 
01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
in our
 
01:58:32.709 --> 01:58:32.719 align:start position:0%
in our municipal ordinance in portsmouth
 
01:58:34.709 --> 01:58:34.719 align:start position:0%
that is encouraged you know people are
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
encouraged to bring their own containers
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
um to bring
 
01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know their own bags and things like
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
that it's a it's sort of a slow steady
 
01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:44.229 align:start position:0%
that it's a it's sort of a slow steady
uh

01:58:44.229 --> 01:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
a slow steady change that'll take people
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
a while to get used to you know no two
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
ways about it
 
01:58:49.599 --> 01:58:50.790 align:start position:0%
ways about it
um

01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
a small change that hopefully will help
 
01:58:58.629 --> 01:58:58.639 align:start position:0%
hello please follow up
 
01:59:00.870 --> 01:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
i typically use my paper bags to take my
 
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
trash to the dump but uh there are
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh would you consider a uh hefty trash
 
01:59:14.790 --> 01:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
i think in the bill we're talking about
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
bills we're talking about bags that are
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
provided to customers
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
so i um
 
01:59:22.719 --> 01:59:22.970 align:start position:0%
so i um
i'm

01:59:22.970 --> 01:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:24.149 align:start position:0%
i'm
[Music]

01:59:24.149 --> 01:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
i think for the most part what we're
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
talking about are the bags that we get
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
at walmart and target and market basket
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
one more follower that was a great
 
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
answer but not to what i ask okay i ask
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
would you consider the hefty trash bags
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
to be a single-use
 
01:59:49.109 --> 01:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
i would say generally yes i know
 
01:59:54.390 --> 01:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
things like leaf bags and work bags um
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
like when you're taking like waste out
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
of your house and things like that
 
01:59:58.629 --> 01:59:58.639 align:start position:0%
they're more durable
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
so some people might use them more than
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
once but i think in general uh i think
 
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's a similar issue
 
02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
to uh the bags that are given away in
 
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
stores they're used once and then
 
02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr mr chair and thank you
 
02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
i would like to follow up on
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative tripp's question
 
02:00:26.790 --> 02:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
um because of the word single use and
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
you cited uh market basket
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
because they have a thicker ply
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
um that what that's what makes them
 
02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:36.310 align:start position:0%
um that what that's what makes them
reusable

02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
reusable
 
02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
um so i'm wondering if you want to to
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
get to your point about
 
02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:43.189 align:start position:0%
get to your point about
the

02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
grocery store or you know
 
02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
places that have the single what we
 
02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
really understand is or
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
the notion of single use would we change
 
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
would you consider changing that phrase
 
02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:55.109 align:start position:0%
would you consider changing that phrase
to

02:00:55.109 --> 02:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
one fly or two ply
 
02:01:01.109 --> 02:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.119 --> 02:01:02.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
yes i mean if if it's something that
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
that you folks think would make would
 
02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
make the bill better and more
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
understandable um
 
02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:11.510 align:start position:0%
understandable um
yes

02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
i'm curious to to know has any of these
 
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill have they
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
considered the concerns related to
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
reusable bags and
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
the sanitation with respect to that and
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
the spreading of germs
 
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
and you know perhaps
 
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
if we might be in a pandemic
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
well i think what i think one issue at a
 
02:01:42.719 --> 02:01:43.910 align:start position:0%
well i think what i think one issue at a
time

02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
but but um you know when it when it
 
02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
comes to that i think one of the things
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
that we went through early on in covid
 
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
was we did have an executive order that
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
that did ban
 
02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:54.629 align:start position:0%
that did ban
um

02:01:54.629 --> 02:01:54.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
those types of reusable bags from
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
grocery stores because there was a
 
02:02:01.270 --> 02:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
concern about transmission i mean
 
02:02:03.669 --> 02:02:03.679 align:start position:0%
anytime you're dealing with things like
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
you know meats and things like that
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
there there is always a danger
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
of bacteria
 
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
building up you know in reusable bags
 
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
but i think it's kind of up to us as
 
02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:16.709 align:start position:0%
but i think it's kind of up to us as
consumers

02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
02:02:16.719 --> 02:02:17.669 align:start position:0%
consumers
to

02:02:17.669 --> 02:02:17.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
keep them clean
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
kind of like anything anything else it's
 
02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
kind of like you wouldn't use you know
 
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
your cooler summer after summer after
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
summer without cleaning it
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
and the same thing for plastic bags at
 
02:02:32.229 --> 02:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
least you know give him a spray of lysol
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:36.719 --> 02:02:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
this whole issue about
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
our is a hefty bag a single use bag
 
02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
might be addressed by
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
saying in
 
02:02:57.750 --> 02:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
your amendment or in your proposed
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
change regulating the distribution of
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic bags and paper bags
 
02:03:04.709 --> 02:03:04.719 align:start position:0%
at point of sale
 
02:03:04.719 --> 02:03:05.830 align:start position:0%
at point of sale
yes

02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:03:08.070 --> 02:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
yes would you accept such an amendment
 
02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
yes i'm not i'm not the prime sponsor
 
02:03:10.159 --> 02:03:10.870 align:start position:0%
yes i'm not i'm not the prime sponsor
but

02:03:10.870 --> 02:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
i would be an enthusiastic co-sponsor
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:18.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:21.589 --> 02:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
now we're going to go to
 
02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
come on up thank you and you're welcome
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
to use the
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
clorox there to sanitize the
 
02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
work area i'm good
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:40.629 --> 02:03:40.639 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is bruce burke and
 
02:03:42.629 --> 02:03:42.639 align:start position:0%
i am from the town of pittsfield
 
02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:45.679 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you for all the time you
 
02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
spend on behalf of our state
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh i want to speak a little bit about
 
02:03:51.669 --> 02:03:51.679 align:start position:0%
this bill and maybe just some general
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
facts for a moment
 
02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:54.470 align:start position:0%
facts for a moment
um

02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
you know astonishingly plastics have
 
02:03:58.629 --> 02:03:58.639 align:start position:0%
only been a major part of our culture
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
since 1950.
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh we older folks
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
some of us in this room remember
 
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
a world that didn't really use a lot of
 
02:04:08.550 --> 02:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
plastic as a matter of fact we lived in
 
02:04:10.069 --> 02:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
a world where they delivered milk to our
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
doors right that world existed plastics
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
is a recent phenomenon and i don't want
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
to bury you with facts
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
but in 1950
 
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh we produce something like 2 million
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
tons of plastic a year and in 2015 that
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
number increased 220 times
 
02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:30.390 align:start position:0%
number increased 220 times
right

02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
plastics have not always been with us
 
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
and they are i think
 
02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:35.510 align:start position:0%
and they are i think
um

02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
you've heard before i think they're an
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
emerging crisis that we're not really
 
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
having said that plastics are an
 
02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
important part of our economy and what i
 
02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
think this bill is trying to
 
02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
address is single-use plastics which are
 
02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
estimated to be
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
i think giving towns the option to
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
eliminate plastic bags and paper bags is
 
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
a step in the right
 
02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
direction to my sense the two major
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
arguments against this one is about
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
individual freedom i as a person should
 
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
be able to decide what i want to do when
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
i go to buy groceries
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
i would suggest however that there's
 
02:05:20.069 --> 02:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
something called a social compact where
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
we as a society try to do the best for
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
all of us even imagine sacrificing the
 
02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
ability to choose between plastic paper
 
02:05:30.079 --> 02:05:31.430 align:start position:0%
ability to choose between plastic paper
or

02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
a reusable bag
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
you could also make the argument that
 
02:05:37.910 --> 02:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
people who are well informed will make
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
the right decision i don't spend my time
 
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
doing this but if you spend 10 minutes
 
02:05:44.550 --> 02:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
outside of hannaford's in concord where
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
i shop 60 70 percent of the people are
 
02:05:49.589 --> 02:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
coming out with plastic bags
 
02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
i think they've heard of the crisis but
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's just not an awareness for them
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
the second argument is economics
 
02:05:57.599 --> 02:05:58.550 align:start position:0%
the second argument is economics
right

02:05:58.550 --> 02:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
families are stretched
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
and they can't afford any additional
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
expenses because what we're saying to
 
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
them is you're going to have to go out
 
02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
and buy reusable bags probably that's
 
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
what you're going to have to do
 
02:06:12.550 --> 02:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
i can accept the first part of this
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
argument that families are stretched but
 
02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:15.679 align:start position:0%
not the second part
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
i went online to find how much plastic
 
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
bags reusable bags cost
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
some were less than a dollar
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
i would suggest to you that any family
 
02:06:27.910 --> 02:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
would be willing to spend five ten
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars
 
02:06:32.550 --> 02:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
pizza with pepperoni
 
02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:33.750 align:start position:0%
pizza with pepperoni
right

02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
to ensure the health of their kids
 
02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
i would also say and it's been brought
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
up before that
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
reducing this
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
will help our waste stream
 
02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
it'll reduce demand for new landfill
 
02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
which is a major issue in new hampshire
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
at the moment
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
and as i said uh even reduce if you
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
followed it plastics in our lakes
 
02:07:01.109 --> 02:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
sideways last week the governor said in
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
his one of his talks that we have the
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
largest surplus we've had in the history
 
02:07:06.629 --> 02:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
he said conservatively we have a two to
 
02:07:11.589 --> 02:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
three hundred million dollar surplus
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's conservative he said
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
imagine and this bill doesn't ask it but
 
02:07:19.030 --> 02:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
just imagine for a moment if the state
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
went out and bought a reusable bag at a
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
dollar a bag for every citizen in this
 
02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:24.470 align:start position:0%
dollar a bag for every citizen in this
state

02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:07:27.109 --> 02:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
it'd be one and a half million dollars
 
02:07:29.350 --> 02:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
be 0.5
 
02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
of his suggested surplus
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to say is
 
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
that i think this is a minor step an
 
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
important step to create awareness and
 
02:07:40.149 --> 02:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
to help our landfill and our future
 
02:07:42.069 --> 02:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
health and thank you for your time and
 
02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
i've been in trouble before i recognize
 
02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:58.470 align:start position:0%
i've been in trouble before i recognize
that

02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know those of us who used to get
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
milk delivered to our houses before
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
plastic bags didn't have to deal with
 
02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
these phones that's all i'm trying to
 
02:08:04.639 --> 02:08:09.510 align:start position:0%
these phones that's all i'm trying to
say

02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:10.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:08:11.910 --> 02:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony i'm going
 
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
to move on thank you because a lot of
 
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh christina
 
02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
all right good morning uh
 
02:08:32.069 --> 02:08:32.079 align:start position:0%
cheryl dolan uh vice chair piedmont and
 
02:08:33.669 --> 02:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
christina dubin i am a volunteer
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
secretary and campaigns coordinator for
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire chapter of the
 
02:08:42.149 --> 02:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
surfrider foundation
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
and our chapter has worked to address
 
02:08:46.069 --> 02:08:46.079 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic and packaging
 
02:08:47.910 --> 02:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
pollution in seacoast communities for
 
02:08:49.589 --> 02:08:49.599 align:start position:0%
well over a decade
 
02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
um before i begin your microphone
 
02:08:55.589 --> 02:08:55.599 align:start position:0%
it is on do i make it lower yeah no just
 
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
maybe speak in it
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay sorry about that
 
02:09:01.030 --> 02:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
um so i'm here to ask for support of
 
02:09:04.149 --> 02:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
hb1119 but before i um begin on that i
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
just wanted to address the question
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
about paper bags
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
from my understanding
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
having paper bags as well as plastic
 
02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
allows for perhaps adding a fee
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
mechanism so not just to outright get
 
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
rid of them but it would allow
 
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities to add
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
something like that so not to get rid of
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
them entirely but perhaps to do
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
something to incentivize
 
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
behavioral change
 
02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:28.950 align:start position:0%
behavioral change
so

02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
hb 1119 would basically just clarify
 
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
current ambiguity regarding the inherent
 
02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:36.629 align:start position:0%
current ambiguity regarding the inherent
authority

02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
authority
 
02:09:36.639 --> 02:09:38.069 align:start position:0%
authority
um

02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:40.709 --> 02:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
that municipal municipalities have to
 
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
regulate waste from single-use paper and
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
plastic bags
 
02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
and this is really important um it's an
 
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
important clarification of existing
 
02:09:54.149 --> 02:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
and it is basically stalled local
 
02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:57.750 align:start position:0%
and it is basically stalled local
efforts

02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
for municipalities to follow in the
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
footsteps of portsmouth to pass local
 
02:10:05.189 --> 02:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
laws to meet waste mitigation needs
 
02:10:07.109 --> 02:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
which ultimately help to achieve the
 
02:10:09.910 --> 02:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
state's source reduction goals
 
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
what hb 1119 does not do is ask this
 
02:10:14.550 --> 02:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
committee or the state to make a
 
02:10:16.709 --> 02:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
decision about whether or not single-use
 
02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
backs should be mitigated in any way nor
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
request any
 
02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
administration of solid waste
 
02:10:25.589 --> 02:10:25.599 align:start position:0%
regulations at the municipal level it
 
02:10:25.599 --> 02:10:26.310 align:start position:0%
regulations at the municipal level it
just

02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:10:29.550 --> 02:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
simply clarifies that ambiguity in
 
02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:31.189 align:start position:0%
simply clarifies that ambiguity in
149-m

02:10:31.189 --> 02:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
149-m
 
02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
um from municipalities that you know for
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
well over a decade have expressed this
 
02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:36.310 align:start position:0%
well over a decade have expressed this
desire

02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
desire
 
02:10:38.790 --> 02:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh to have local laws aimed at plastic
 
02:10:42.870 --> 02:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
is that okay to go on no that that's
 
02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
your time is up
 
02:10:48.870 --> 02:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
that was three minutes that was two
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
minutes that was two minutes okay
 
02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
can you wrap up in a sentence or two um
 
02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:55.350 align:start position:0%
can you wrap up in a sentence or two um
yes

02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:56.550 align:start position:0%
yes
uh

02:10:56.550 --> 02:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:10:58.709 --> 02:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
so let me just see if i um
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll just know i just want to
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
give one example of the kind of the
 
02:11:04.149 --> 02:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
ambiguity that's perpetuated um in the
 
02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
past our chapters uh testified in
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
support of senator martha fuller clark's
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
sb 410 in 2016
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
and the committee uh public and
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
municipal affairs committee at the time
 
02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:16.149 align:start position:0%
municipal affairs committee at the time
argued

02:11:16.149 --> 02:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
argued
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
that it would be redundant stating that
 
02:11:20.229 --> 02:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
there's already inherent authority in
 
02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
our state solid waste regulations so
 
02:11:25.030 --> 02:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:11:26.709 --> 02:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
next we'll hear from

02:11:53.589 --> 02:11:53.599 align:start position:0%
new england convenience store
 
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
and energy marketers association that's
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
a mouthful
 
02:11:59.669 --> 02:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
we go by nexima and we represent
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
convenience stores
 
02:12:02.550 --> 02:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
not only in new hampshire but all
 
02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
throughout new england
 
02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
in here in new hampshire we have about
 
02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
850 stores
 
02:12:07.679 --> 02:12:08.629 align:start position:0%
850 stores
um

02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
roughly employing close to 14 000 people
 
02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to read this testimony i
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
have had it submitted to you folks
 
02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
online i think the one point i'm going
 
02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
to make is we have experienced
 
02:12:22.069 --> 02:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
how bad this approach has worked in the
 
02:12:24.390 --> 02:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
state of massachusetts
 
02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:25.189 align:start position:0%
state of massachusetts
where

02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
many of our members own several stores
 
02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
throughout different municipalities and
 
02:12:31.990 --> 02:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
localities and we've just seen that this
 
02:12:34.149 --> 02:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
is very difficult to deal with in
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
managed shell i'll leave it at that
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that folks may have
 
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
but i appreciate your time
 
02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony
 
02:12:43.109 --> 02:12:43.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
next we're going to hear from
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
curtis barry
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you and good morning mr
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee i am
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
curtis barry here on behalf of the new
 
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire retail association the new
 
02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire retail association represents
 
02:13:06.629 --> 02:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
several hundred retailers in new
 
02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire both the national major chains
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
and many hundred small independent
 
02:13:12.239 --> 02:13:13.270 align:start position:0%
and many hundred small independent
businesses

02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
02:13:15.189 --> 02:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
i'm here to oppose
 
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
this legislation my testimony is is very
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
brief into the point
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
the retail association is
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
very wary of
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
a trend that this bill may start which
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
is environmental regulation on a town by
 
02:13:32.229 --> 02:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
town basis there are 234 municipalities
 
02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
this bill could set up a
 
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
a scheme where you're pitting one town
 
02:13:40.149 --> 02:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
against another in this and then
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
potentially other environmental
 
02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:43.109 align:start position:0%
potentially other environmental
regulations

02:13:43.109 --> 02:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
you folks are 400 strong in a small
 
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
state with very small communities we
 
02:13:50.310 --> 02:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
think you're you have the ability to
 
02:13:53.109 --> 02:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
decide environmental regulations on a
 
02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
statewide basis which is more
 
02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:55.830 align:start position:0%
statewide basis which is more
appropriate

02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
one last point i think i'd like to make
 
02:13:59.430 --> 02:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
there are more
 
02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
reasons why
 
02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
should not pass it would be ineffective
 
02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
for example one town banning
 
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
plastic bags does not mean plastic bags
 
02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
don't enter the waste stream in their
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
community if i lived in portsmouth i
 
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
could shop in newington where they might
 
02:14:17.830 --> 02:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
not ban the distribution of the
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
single-use bags
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
bring them back into town
 
02:14:23.830 --> 02:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
if i were visiting hampton beach i could
 
02:14:26.550 --> 02:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
shop here in concord bring my
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
lunch in a plastic bag in hampton beach
 
02:14:32.950 --> 02:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh responsible disposal is the solution
 
02:14:34.149 --> 02:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
i think you'll probably hear more about
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
that later this morning or during this
 
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
hearing i'm happy to answer questions to
 
02:14:40.550 --> 02:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
the best of my ability
 
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
next we're going to hear from
 
02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
welcome kevin you've got two minutes two
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
minutes okay i'll try my best good
 
02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
morning mr chairman members of the
 
02:15:03.910 --> 02:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
committee try not to talk so fast here
 
02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
my name is kevin daigle i'm the
 
02:15:07.589 --> 02:15:07.599 align:start position:0%
president of the new hampshire grocers
 
02:15:07.599 --> 02:15:08.870 align:start position:0%
president of the new hampshire grocers
association

02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
for those of you not familiar with us
 
02:15:11.830 --> 02:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
and this doesn't count in the two
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
minutes yet right
 
02:15:16.229 --> 02:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
we are the organization that represents
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
both chain and independent grocery
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
stores supermarkets convenience stores
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
and their suppliers
 
02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
before i begin a couple of the first
 
02:15:29.030 --> 02:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
presenters doing their testimony had
 
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
talked about environmental awareness
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
i just want to get back to the bill
 
02:15:33.599 --> 02:15:34.629 align:start position:0%
i just want to get back to the bill
itself

02:15:34.629 --> 02:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
itself
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
is allowing towns to regulate the use of
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
paper and plastic bags
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
so if passed this bill would have many
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences as you're aware
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a dillon rule state
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
meaning that the state retains all
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
powers which are not specifically
 
02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
granted to municipalities it has been
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
wise to maintain dillon's rule as
 
02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
opposed to home rule and for good reason
 
02:15:59.189 --> 02:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a state of 234 cities
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
and towns located in a very compact
 
02:16:03.589 --> 02:16:03.599 align:start position:0%
geographic area
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
grocers do their best to attract
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
customers from not only their own
 
02:16:08.229 --> 02:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
community but from surrounding
 
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
communities as well as well
 
02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
now imagine if this bill was passed if
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
suddenly a particular community
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
instituted a ban or mandated a fee these
 
02:16:20.470 --> 02:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
communities in grocers within those
 
02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
communities could see a migration of
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
consumers to other towns
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
now through no fault of their own other
 
02:16:28.229 --> 02:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
than being in the wrong community
 
02:16:29.910 --> 02:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
businesses would lose commerce to
 
02:16:32.469 --> 02:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
businesses and other towns by allowing
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
towns to create their own rules both
 
02:16:36.549 --> 02:16:36.559 align:start position:0%
retailers and customers would be faced
 
02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
with differing regulations from town to
 
02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:39.750 align:start position:0%
with differing regulations from town to
town

02:16:39.750 --> 02:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
grocers like many other businesses
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
oppose a patchwork quilt of local
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
ordinances the immense complexity of
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
operating in an environment of varying
 
02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
local laws
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
increases customer confusion and through
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
high costs of compliance unnecessarily
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
increase the cost for all the parties
 
02:16:58.950 --> 02:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
in addition to the confusion and
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
complexities this creates for businesses
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
this bill sets a bad precedent it
 
02:17:06.309 --> 02:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
provides an opportunity of past for
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
other issues to come forward seeking
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
home rule for their cause thus creating
 
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
an even greater web of regulations that
 
02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
businesses and citizens just now need to
 
02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:16.230 align:start position:0%
businesses and citizens just now need to
navigate

02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
navigate
 
02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we ask you to find the
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
bill inexpedient to legislate i thank
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%

thank you you made it within two seconds
 
02:17:30.389 --> 02:17:30.399 align:start position:0%

thank you chairman and thank you uh for
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
the groceries association so would you
 
02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
support a statewide ban on with the
 
02:17:42.549 --> 02:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
groceries association support a
 
02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
statewide ban on plastic bags we would
 
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
have to look at what those details
 
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
look like and entailed
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:17:54.150 --> 02:17:54.160 align:start position:0%

02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:04.230 --> 02:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
feel free to use the clorox to sanitize
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
your area
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman vice chairman
 
02:18:09.750 --> 02:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:18:11.190 --> 02:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
zachary taylor i'm the director of the
 
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
american recyclable plastic bag alliance
 
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
we represent the u.s manufacturers and
 
02:18:17.750 --> 02:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
recyclers of plastic bags we oppose this
 
02:18:20.469 --> 02:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
bill for multiple reasons most notably
 
02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
the complicated patchwork of local
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
ordinances that opens the door to
 
02:18:25.669 --> 02:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
we've heard from businesses in the
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
community about why that's a bad idea
 
02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
but i want to focus on a few other
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
things that were raised this morning
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
notably the concerns about plastic bags
 
02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
and the environment data from the
 
02:18:36.629 --> 02:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
environmental protection agency
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
finds that plastic bags and sacks
 
02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
combined all plastic bags and sacks
 
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
account for 0.3 percent of municipal
 
02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
solid waste plastic carryout bags
 
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
targeted by this bill account for a
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
fraction of that
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
litter surveys from across the country
 
02:18:52.629 --> 02:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
consistently find that during litter
 
02:18:54.309 --> 02:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
clamps plastic bags account for less
 
02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
than one percent of litter and data from
 
02:18:57.910 --> 02:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
the ocean conservancy finds that beach
 
02:18:59.669 --> 02:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
cleanup items plastic bags account for a
 
02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
similar amount what that means to say is
 
02:19:03.030 --> 02:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
that while
 
02:19:05.429 --> 02:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
efforts to ban plastic bags to address
 
02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
environmental concerns and advanced
 
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
sustainability they will miss the mark
 
02:19:11.030 --> 02:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
because these products do not contribute
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
meaningfully to these real issues
 
02:19:14.469 --> 02:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
however they do open the door to
 
02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences alternative bags
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
are more expensive for businesses to
 
02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:19.270 align:start position:0%
are more expensive for businesses to
procure

02:19:19.270 --> 02:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
procure
 
02:19:20.629 --> 02:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
particularly paper bags there's a
 
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
national shortage of paper bags right
 
02:19:23.509 --> 02:19:23.519 align:start position:0%
now that is going to hurt small
 
02:19:25.830 --> 02:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
businesses distinctly who will lose the
 
02:19:28.309 --> 02:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
ability to access economies of scale in
 
02:19:31.110 --> 02:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
purchasing their carryout bags
 
02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:32.790 align:start position:0%
purchasing their carryout bags
furthermore

02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
bag fees also
 
02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
hit vulnerable families more severely
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
research from the university of ottawa
 
02:19:40.309 --> 02:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
on toronto's bag fee found that lower
 
02:19:41.910 --> 02:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic families are more likely
 
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
to be hit by these policies but most
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
importantly i want to underscore we're
 
02:19:47.910 --> 02:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
the first to say that if you don't need
 
02:19:49.910 --> 02:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
a bag don't take one we care deeply
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
about sustainability that's why we
 
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
promote recycling in the store take back
 
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
program that provides a pathway for
 
02:19:57.270 --> 02:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
plastic bags and films to be returned to
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
the store and transformed into new
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
products like bags railroad ties
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
composite lumber decking and other
 
02:20:06.630 --> 02:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
similar applications we believe that
 
02:20:08.389 --> 02:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
increasing recycled content promoting
 
02:20:09.910 --> 02:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
recycling and promoting consumer
 
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
education around these issues is a
 
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
better approach than bans that force
 
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
consumers to use alternative bags that
 
02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
are both more expensive for them but
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
also have greater environmental impacts
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
every life cycle assessment has found
 
02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
that comparing carryout bags the plastic
 
02:20:26.230 --> 02:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
carryout bag when disposed of properly
 
02:20:27.910 --> 02:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
is the one with the fewest environmental
 
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
impacts thank you very much i'm happy to
 
02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative
 
02:20:35.200 --> 02:20:36.550 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative
majipudi

02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
majipudi
 
02:20:38.550 --> 02:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:20:40.950 --> 02:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
my question um
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
don't you
 
02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
in your facts or in your research have
 
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
you come across the fact that single-use
 
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
plastic bags
 
02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:51.670 align:start position:0%
plastic bags
can

02:20:51.670 --> 02:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
cause uh drainage obstruction or
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
flooding you know in the
 
02:20:59.670 --> 02:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
drains because the easy with which they
 
02:21:02.469 --> 02:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
if it's not properly disposed
 
02:21:02.479 --> 02:21:03.510 align:start position:0%
if it's not properly disposed
um

02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:08.070 --> 02:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
can block the natural rain and flood
 
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh drains
 
02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
getting caught
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative i
 
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
think you know it's important to know
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
that plastic bags do not belong in the
 
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
environment we're the first to say that
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
plastic bags should either be reused at
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
home they overwhelmingly are
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
research from recycled quebec the
 
02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
recycling authority in quebec found that
 
02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
about 77 of plastic bags get reused for
 
02:21:29.670 --> 02:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
household chores like picking up after
 
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
pets uh or lining waste paper bins in
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
the bathroom so the idea that their
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
single use is sort of a misnomer um also
 
02:21:38.230 --> 02:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
it's important to recycle them and as an
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
industry we want to see more recycling
 
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
we were able to put out a release last
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
week that our members
 
02:21:47.110 --> 02:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
have met their recycled content goals
 
02:21:49.030 --> 02:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
for their products so now that on
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
average every plastic retail bag
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
manufactured by our members in the
 
02:21:55.030 --> 02:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
united states contains on average a
 
02:21:56.790 --> 02:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
minimum of 10 recycled content we want
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
to see those numbers continue to
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
increase in future years and to help
 
02:22:01.510 --> 02:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
that we've also partnered with a company
 
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
called stena on a new film drop-off
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
recycling directory that's going to help
 
02:22:07.190 --> 02:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
consumers find where to take these
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
products back to the store so they don't
 
02:22:10.230 --> 02:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
have to throw them out they can actually
 
02:22:11.590 --> 02:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
recycle them in the store take back
 
02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
program yeah i have a question for you
 
02:22:17.190 --> 02:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
is are biodegradable plastic bags uh an
 
02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:18.309 align:start position:0%
is are biodegradable plastic bags uh an
option

02:22:18.309 --> 02:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
option
 
02:22:20.469 --> 02:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh so it depends on sorry thank you for
 
02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
the question mr chairman it depends what
 
02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
you mean by biodegradable so there's
 
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
multiple kinds of plastics most uh
 
02:22:27.429 --> 02:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
plastics are compostable and most of
 
02:22:28.790 --> 02:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
those compostable plastics require
 
02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
industrial composting
 
02:22:32.950 --> 02:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
what the life cycle assessments find is
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
that the traditional plastic carryout
 
02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
bag as long as it's disposed of properly
 
02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
is the one with the least environmental
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
impacts and that's the one that a lot of
 
02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
consumers reuse and a lot of consumers
 
02:22:42.080 --> 02:22:44.230 align:start position:0%
consumers reuse and a lot of consumers
recycle

02:22:44.230 --> 02:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
recycle
 
02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
02:22:47.510 --> 02:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of consumers reuse and recycle the
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
the traditional plastic carryout bag
 
02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your testimony um
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
next i want to hear from mary smith
 
02:22:58.630 --> 02:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i have a question oh yes
 
02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
02:23:01.670 --> 02:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:23:03.990 --> 02:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
during your presentation you identified
 
02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:07.349 align:start position:0%
during your presentation you identified
uh

02:23:07.349 --> 02:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
several items that
 
02:23:11.590 --> 02:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
these bags can be uh
 
02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
recycled into basically products could
 
02:23:15.590 --> 02:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
give us those products again and not so
 
02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:18.469 align:start position:0%
give us those products again and not so
fast

02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
fast
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely thank you for the
 
02:23:21.270 --> 02:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
so plastic bags when the return to the
 
02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
store are purchased by other companies
 
02:23:26.469 --> 02:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
to be turned into a variety of other
 
02:23:29.349 --> 02:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
materials including new bags
 
02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
railroad ties composite lumber composite
 
02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
decking furniture i think that was
 
02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
raised earlier playground equipment and
 
02:23:36.870 --> 02:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
similar applications there's continued
 
02:23:39.190 --> 02:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
research going on about other ways to
 
02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:40.309 align:start position:0%
research going on about other ways to
reuse

02:23:40.309 --> 02:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
reuse
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
these materials recycle them and avoid
 
02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
the use of virgin materials there's new
 
02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
research coming out about using them as
 
02:23:50.309 --> 02:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
binder for asphalt and paving as well
 
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you you're very welcome
 
02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony we're going
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and
 
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:13.830 --> 02:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
it is not the purpose of the government
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
to micromanage every aspect of the
 
02:24:18.790 --> 02:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
interaction between producers and
 
02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:20.230 align:start position:0%
interaction between producers and
consumers

02:24:20.230 --> 02:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
02:24:22.630 --> 02:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
producers should be allowed to provide a
 
02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
low-cost way for consumers to carry
 
02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
their items to their cars and into their
 
02:24:26.319 --> 02:24:27.510 align:start position:0%
their items to their cars and into their
homes

02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
homes
 
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
to allow for towns to regulate how
 
02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
businesses interact
 
02:24:34.469 --> 02:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
with the public in this way interferes
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily with the market which
 
02:24:38.950 --> 02:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
increases costs that businesses have to
 
02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:39.910 align:start position:0%
increases costs that businesses have to
pay

02:24:39.910 --> 02:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
pay
 
02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
and inevitably the businesses won't pay
 
02:24:45.429 --> 02:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
them the consumers will pay them
 
02:24:48.070 --> 02:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
states such as california have tried
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
similar bills which leads to more
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
financial burdens being placed on
 
02:24:55.030 --> 02:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
businesses especially small businesses
 
02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
this burdensome regulation has no place
 
02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and impedes the whole
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
live free or die spirit that makes the
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
state so great
 
02:25:04.319 --> 02:25:06.469 align:start position:0%
state so great
um

02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:11.110 align:start position:0%
 
for

02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%

02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
and last we have uh some testimony from
 
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:34.790 --> 02:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
you to the committee um i want to make
 
02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:38.230 align:start position:0%
you to the committee um i want to make
clear

02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
clear
 
02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
especially after the comments of the
 
02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
previous speakers this isn't a ban on
 
02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
plastic bags all this is is enabling
 
02:25:47.110 --> 02:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
legislations to let our towns and cities
 
02:25:49.510 --> 02:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
who have the cost and the responsibility
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
of managing solid waste to make this
 
02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:53.190 align:start position:0%
of managing solid waste to make this
decision

02:25:53.190 --> 02:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:25:56.150 --> 02:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
a similar bill that was a statewide ban
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
came before the legislature about three
 
02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
or four years ago i voted against that
 
02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
i don't believe in a statewide ban on
 
02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
this but i do believe that we should
 
02:26:08.950 --> 02:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
enable our towns and cities to make the
 
02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
decisions that are best for them
 
02:26:14.309 --> 02:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
i seriously doubt that if this bill
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
passes that my town of merrimack will
 
02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
will enable will use it
 
02:26:22.230 --> 02:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to pre-support pre to
 
02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
presuppose that what's good for
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
merrimack is also good for
 
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
littleton or colebrook or hampton or
 
02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
portsmouth this is simply letting our
 
02:26:35.870 --> 02:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
towns and and cities who have the
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility for solid waste
 
02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:38.950 align:start position:0%
responsibility for solid waste
management

02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
management
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%

02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:11.040 align:start position:0%

02:28:59.349 --> 02:28:59.359 align:start position:0%

02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
and county committee
 
02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
i realized that
 
02:30:10.389 --> 02:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
you folks probably want to get to lunch
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
so i'll be as concise as i possibly can
 
02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:14.710 align:start position:0%
so i'll be as concise as i possibly can
um

02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:16.230 --> 02:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
there's a number of handouts that are
 
02:30:18.630 --> 02:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
going around so
 
02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'll be
 
02:30:21.910 --> 02:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
very uh concise
 
02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh this the issue this bill seeks to
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
address is the overly broad broad
 
02:30:30.070 --> 02:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
language in rsa47 colon 17
 
02:30:31.750 --> 02:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
it has come to everyone's attention that
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
the cities of keene portsmouth berlin
 
02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
lebanon and durham have passed town wide
 
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
mask ordinances all with different rules
 
02:30:41.429 --> 02:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
and many with no quantitative
 
02:30:43.750 --> 02:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
exploration information this has
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
resulted in some confusion

have an example for you

the language in this rsa can also be
 
02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
better defined to reflect our existing

and to avoid conflicts with dylan's rule
 
02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
we can improve the consistency
 
02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
with this bill that i have the amendment

02:32:20.950 --> 02:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
it says quote new hampshire dhhs has the
 
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to lead these efforts
 
02:32:25.270 --> 02:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
this was in the communicable disease

found on the website
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh dhhs should lead the the efforts with
 
02:32:33.830 --> 02:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
regard to communicable disease because

in other staff
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%

in the state to handle such problems

on a statewide level
 
02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
and furthermore because a town wide town
 
02:32:55.349 --> 02:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
by town approach will only lead to a
 
02:32:59.670 --> 02:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
patchwork of confusing bylaws
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
please see
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
if you may
 
02:33:02.479 --> 02:33:04.469 align:start position:0%
if you may
the

02:33:04.469 --> 02:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:33:07.510 --> 02:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
city of portsmouth's directive it says
 
02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
public health directive on the top
 
02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
and this is uh taken from the city of
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:15.359 --> 02:33:16.309 align:start position:0%
 
where

02:33:16.309 --> 02:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:33:19.270 --> 02:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
it is unclear whether this is a law a
 
02:33:23.429 --> 02:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
that has not been clear to me i've
 
02:33:27.590 --> 02:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
reached out to this department
 
02:33:29.670 --> 02:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
to get clarification but as you see if
 
02:33:31.510 --> 02:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
you flip it to the back
 
02:33:36.710 --> 02:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
it is signed by a city employee
 
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's a health officer
 
02:33:40.950 --> 02:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
who is employed not elected
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
by the people
 
02:33:43.670 --> 02:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
and it is a
 
02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
mask mandate as i understand i tried to
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
look this up on the uh there's some news
 
02:33:50.790 --> 02:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
articles about it it's my understanding
 
02:33:53.110 --> 02:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
because the city of portsmouth is still
 
02:33:55.910 --> 02:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the hearing process of this statute
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
or this bill this bylaw for this
 
02:33:59.910 --> 02:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
for the city so
 
02:34:02.950 --> 02:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
um i hope this is maybe the last time i
 
02:34:04.950 --> 02:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
ever see a directive
 
02:34:07.270 --> 02:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
or a bylaw that's
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
posing as a law
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
signed by a city employee
 
02:34:12.550 --> 02:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
at the bottom
 
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
they have referenced
 
02:34:17.830 --> 02:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
the statute in 40
 
02:34:20.790 --> 02:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
147 colon 1.
 
02:34:23.429 --> 02:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
now that is meant to
 
02:34:23.439 --> 02:34:24.309 align:start position:0%
now that is meant to
um

02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
yeah the health officers may make
 
02:34:27.590 --> 02:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
regulations but
 
02:34:30.150 --> 02:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be
 
02:34:32.870 --> 02:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
approved by the selectmen
 
02:34:34.309 --> 02:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge that they are still on
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
the hearings
 
02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:36.790 align:start position:0%
the hearings
stage

02:34:36.790 --> 02:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
stage
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:34:41.190 --> 02:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
what this is exactly i don't know but it
 
02:34:45.590 --> 02:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
is confusion i would say uh okay
 
02:34:48.150 --> 02:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
also please see the map that i've passed
 
02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:48.870 align:start position:0%
also please see the map that i've passed
out

02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:34:50.469 --> 02:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:34:52.309 --> 02:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire that i've taken
 
02:34:55.030 --> 02:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
off of our covert 19 interactive
 
02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:56.710 align:start position:0%
off of our covert 19 interactive
dashboard

02:34:56.710 --> 02:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
dashboard
 
02:34:58.870 --> 02:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
i've gone through and and highlighted
 
02:35:01.349 --> 02:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
and outlined the cities that have mask
 
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
mandates just to show you that
 
02:35:06.150 --> 02:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh there's nothing jumping out here that
 
02:35:08.389 --> 02:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
says that mask mandates works at work
 
02:35:10.950 --> 02:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
and this isn't a
 
02:35:12.790 --> 02:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
a testimony about
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
whether masks work or not
 
02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
i realize that's a whole other issue but
 
02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make sure that there
 
02:35:22.469 --> 02:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
wasn't any thing jumping out saying uh
 
02:35:24.790 --> 02:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
these cities have some sort of
 
02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
overwhelming advantage
 
02:35:30.630 --> 02:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:32.309 align:start position:0%
 
transmission

02:35:32.309 --> 02:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
02:35:34.309 --> 02:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
02:35:37.110 --> 02:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
also okay so they may make any other
 
02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:38.790 align:start position:0%
also okay so they may make any other
bylaws

02:35:38.790 --> 02:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
bylaws
 
02:35:41.990 --> 02:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the uh bill itself
 
02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
or in the rsa
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh the the the language that we're
 
02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:48.469 align:start position:0%
uh the the the language that we're
addressing

02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
02:35:51.670 --> 02:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
is on line 16. they may make any other
 
02:35:53.990 --> 02:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
bylaws and regulations
 
02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
um for which may seem for the well-being
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
of the city
 
02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
but they don't really mean any
 
02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh because of dylan's
 
02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:03.590 align:start position:0%
uh because of dylan's
rule

02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
rule
 
02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:05.990 align:start position:0%
rule
um

02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
this isn't really it's it's uh ancient
 
02:36:10.469 --> 02:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
language from
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
the year of 19 1846. the language is
 
02:36:16.230 --> 02:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
quaint and attorneys will warn you about
 
02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
enforcing it due to constitutionality
 
02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:20.950 align:start position:0%
enforcing it due to constitutionality
issues

02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
so if you read chapter 47 someday and i
 
02:36:25.270 --> 02:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
hope you do it's it's full of all kinds
 
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
of quaint language
 
02:36:28.389 --> 02:36:28.399 align:start position:0%
um including
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh giving cities
 
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
leeway to make to regulate all kinds of
 
02:36:36.389 --> 02:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
quote all kinds of immoral and obscene
 
02:36:38.950 --> 02:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
conduct it's very broad
 
02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
but just to read a little bit about
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
dylan's rule is a municipal corporation
 
02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
can exercise only the powers explicitly
 
02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:52.150 --> 02:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
those or those necessarily or fairly
 
02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:53.590 align:start position:0%
those or those necessarily or fairly
implied

02:36:53.590 --> 02:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
implied
 
02:36:55.670 --> 02:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
or incident to the powers expressly
 
02:36:58.309 --> 02:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
granted those essential to the declared
 
02:37:01.270 --> 02:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
objects and purposes of that corporation
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
not simply convenient but indispensable
 
02:37:06.309 --> 02:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
dylan's rule states that if there is a
 
02:37:08.630 --> 02:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable doubt whether a power has
 
02:37:10.309 --> 02:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
been conferred to a local government
 
02:37:13.030 --> 02:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
then the power has not been conferred
 
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
i would argue that
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
there is a reasonable doubt um
 
02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:21.510 align:start position:0%
there is a reasonable doubt um
so

02:37:21.510 --> 02:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:37:24.150 --> 02:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
what i have done and i hope uh
 
02:37:27.349 --> 02:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
you like this is um
 
02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
i have clarified this
 
02:37:32.389 --> 02:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
if you look in your
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
public health nuisance guidance document
 
02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
on page four this is a great
 
02:37:41.190 --> 02:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
sort of study
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
that was conducted in 2014
 
02:37:46.389 --> 02:37:46.399 align:start position:0%
by the
 
02:37:48.150 --> 02:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
you can see the list of all the
 
02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
different um
 
02:37:52.070 --> 02:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
health officers public health officials
 
02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
of the state and it really it really
 
02:37:56.710 --> 02:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
gives a lot of great i emailed it to all
 
02:37:58.469 --> 02:37:58.479 align:start position:0%
the committee members because it's 22
 
02:37:58.479 --> 02:37:59.990 align:start position:0%
the committee members because it's 22
pages

02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
pages
 
02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
and i have only printed out nine in the
 
02:38:03.429 --> 02:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
interest of
 
02:38:06.150 --> 02:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
saving trees
 
02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
but if you see on it sort of goes into
 
02:38:11.590 --> 02:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
defining what a public health nuisance
 
02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:12.630 align:start position:0%
defining what a public health nuisance
is

02:38:12.630 --> 02:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:38:16.710 --> 02:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:22.469 --> 02:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
it says at the top
 
02:38:24.710 --> 02:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
first paragraph the task force was
 
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
interested in developing model language
 
02:38:29.270 --> 02:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
that could be used by cities and towns
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
interested in developing stronger
 
02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
public health ordinances
 
02:38:35.270 --> 02:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
so they did this study and then at the
 
02:38:38.389 --> 02:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
bottom where it says overview of public
 
02:38:39.830 --> 02:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
health nuisance
 
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
they sort of just
 
02:38:43.750 --> 02:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
define it
 
02:38:45.910 --> 02:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
since i've noticed some people have
 
02:38:47.590 --> 02:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
are not sure whether a communicable
 
02:38:49.270 --> 02:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
disease is a nuisance
 
02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
in general a nuisance is defined as a
 
02:38:54.150 --> 02:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
condition activity or situation such as
 
02:38:55.110 --> 02:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
a loud
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
noise or a foul odor that interferes
 
02:39:00.550 --> 02:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
with the use and enjoyment of property
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
especially in non-transitory condition
 
02:39:05.510 --> 02:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
or persistent activity that either
 
02:39:07.270 --> 02:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
injures the physical condition of the
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
adjacent land
 
02:39:09.439 --> 02:39:10.469 align:start position:0%
adjacent land
or

02:39:10.469 --> 02:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
interferes with the enjoyment of
 
02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
easements and that is consistent with
 
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
what we have
 
02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:17.990 align:start position:0%
what we have
heard

02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
in our last
 
02:39:22.630 --> 02:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
testimony of the health officer bill
 
02:39:28.230 --> 02:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:28.240 --> 02:39:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:31.830 --> 02:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
i have uh i think you all have the
 
02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:33.830 align:start position:0%
i have uh i think you all have the
amendment

02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:39:35.429 --> 02:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
um and i think
 
02:39:37.110 --> 02:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
that i actually
 
02:39:39.510 --> 02:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
passed out all of
 
02:39:41.190 --> 02:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
the amendments to everybody but i didn't
 
02:39:43.270 --> 02:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
keep one
 
02:39:45.429 --> 02:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
does anyone have
 
02:39:45.439 --> 02:39:47.590 align:start position:0%
does anyone have
um

02:39:47.590 --> 02:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
so what i've done is taken that
 
02:39:54.870 --> 02:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:58.630 --> 02:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
i've taken i've taken that um
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
definition and incorporated it
 
02:40:03.670 --> 02:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
incorporated it into
 
02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:05.429 align:start position:0%
incorporated it into
um

02:40:05.429 --> 02:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
line 16 here
 
02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
and it just now says they may make any
 
02:40:13.349 --> 02:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
other bylaws and regulations
 
02:40:15.110 --> 02:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
and i crossed out which may seem for the
 
02:40:19.269 --> 02:40:19.279 align:start position:0%
well-being of the city because it is
 
02:40:21.269 --> 02:40:21.279 align:start position:0%
of course all the regulations are going
 
02:40:23.590 --> 02:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
going to seem for the well-being of city
 
02:40:26.469 --> 02:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
just for the sake of flow
 
02:40:28.469 --> 02:40:28.479 align:start position:0%
they may make any other regulations and
 
02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
bylaws for the abatement of nuisances
 
02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
that interfere with the use and
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
enjoyment of property to emphasize
 
02:40:39.190 --> 02:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
that it pertains to
 
02:40:41.990 --> 02:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
the use of property
 
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
which by all measures
 
02:40:46.710 --> 02:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
is consistent with everything else that
 
02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:47.429 align:start position:0%
is consistent with everything else that
i've

02:40:47.429 --> 02:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
i've
 
02:40:49.910 --> 02:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
seen on the dhh website about
 
02:40:53.429 --> 02:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
nuisances and about the role of public
 
02:40:53.439 --> 02:40:55.910 align:start position:0%
nuisances and about the role of public
health

02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:58.630 --> 02:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
regulation within the city so
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
i think these changes are the
 
02:41:02.070 --> 02:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
responsible thing to do i'm asking you
 
02:41:03.990 --> 02:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
to support the amendment last year we
 
02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
had a similar bill which eliminated the
 
02:41:08.550 --> 02:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
regulation ability
 
02:41:11.750 --> 02:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
for cities to pass any bylaws at all
 
02:41:14.830 --> 02:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
so i think this is a good compromise it
 
02:41:17.349 --> 02:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
allows the ability of cities to make
 
02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
their own regulations pertaining to
 
02:41:21.510 --> 02:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
local issues
 
02:41:23.510 --> 02:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
as they would like
 
02:41:26.070 --> 02:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
but it also clarifies and better defines
 
02:41:28.309 --> 02:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
the purview of public health
 
02:41:30.070 --> 02:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
within city government and it's
 
02:41:32.790 --> 02:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
consistent with the existing
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
dhhs guidance on
 
02:41:36.479 --> 02:41:37.670 align:start position:0%
dhhs guidance on
regulating

02:41:37.670 --> 02:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
regulating
 
02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:40.150 align:start position:0%
regulating
and

02:41:40.150 --> 02:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:42.070 --> 02:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
regulating public health especially
 
02:41:44.630 --> 02:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases thank you very
 
02:41:47.349 --> 02:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
much i think that's it's a question for
 
02:41:47.359 --> 02:41:48.550 align:start position:0%
much i think that's it's a question for
you

02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
as i understand
 
02:41:52.870 --> 02:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
what you've done here
 
02:41:54.630 --> 02:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
it does it seems like you're not
 
02:41:57.429 --> 02:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
objecting to the mask ordinance you're
 
02:41:58.950 --> 02:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
objecting to the
 
02:42:00.550 --> 02:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
to the fact that the community doesn't
 
02:42:02.309 --> 02:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
have the authority to implement a mass
 
02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
coordinates is that right
 
02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman dolan um
 
02:42:10.469 --> 02:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:13.910 --> 02:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much true um i'm objecting to the
 
02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
idea of not just the mask ordinance is
 
02:42:19.670 --> 02:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
sort of incidental to the larger picture
 
02:42:21.349 --> 02:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
um of
 
02:42:22.469 --> 02:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:42:25.269 --> 02:42:25.279 align:start position:0%
narrowly defining what cities and towns
 
02:42:28.309 --> 02:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
may do in keeping with dylan's law
 
02:42:30.070 --> 02:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
where you know we're getting into the
 
02:42:32.710 --> 02:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
sort of slippery slope of
 
02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:33.590 align:start position:0%
sort of slippery slope of
by

02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:42:35.590 --> 02:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
um interpreting
 
02:42:38.790 --> 02:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
this line of any they may make any other
 
02:42:42.870 --> 02:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
bylaws well we know that we can't allow
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
you know they they shouldn't be making
 
02:42:47.190 --> 02:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
regulations about personal health
 
02:42:49.190 --> 02:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
or telling us what to eat or drink for
 
02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:50.550 align:start position:0%
or telling us what to eat or drink for
instance

02:42:50.550 --> 02:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
instance
 
02:42:52.469 --> 02:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
i think everyone would agree that maybe
 
02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't allow lockdowns or
 
02:42:58.710 --> 02:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
stay at stay-at-home orders um
 
02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:00.150 align:start position:0%
stay at stay-at-home orders um
so

02:43:00.150 --> 02:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:43:01.349 --> 02:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
those are this
 
02:43:02.950 --> 02:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
so it's just sort of the responsible
 
02:43:05.190 --> 02:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
thing to do to to define it
 
02:43:07.349 --> 02:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
look at this map that you've
 
02:43:10.710 --> 02:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
provided to us have you had a chance to
 
02:43:13.110 --> 02:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
sit with and discuss
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
those those communities that you've
 
02:43:17.190 --> 02:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
highlighted sit with their legal
 
02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
team to see
 
02:43:23.830 --> 02:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
how they feel the legality of this is
 
02:43:27.750 --> 02:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
um i have reached out to portsmouth i
 
02:43:31.349 --> 02:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
i haven't
 
02:43:34.870 --> 02:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
reached out to that to all of not all of
 
02:43:37.110 --> 02:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
the cities say for instance manchester
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
and concord don't have town-wide
 
02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
city-wide mass ordinances
 
02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
i have reached out to
 
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
hanover and i just got dumped into the
 
02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
voicemail i think maybe they're
 
02:43:52.950 --> 02:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
just uh here that it's about mask
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
ordinances or something and then they
 
02:43:54.720 --> 02:43:55.750 align:start position:0%
ordinances or something and then they
just

02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:43:56.950 --> 02:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
02:43:59.190 --> 02:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee yes
 
02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:00.790 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee yes
representative

02:44:00.790 --> 02:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um the map that
 
02:44:06.550 --> 02:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
you show here um
 
02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:07.349 align:start position:0%
you show here um
the

02:44:07.349 --> 02:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
i see that the data is 210 22 are you
 
02:44:13.670 --> 02:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
aware that um what you show here is that
 
02:44:15.510 --> 02:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of nashua's mass
 
02:44:18.550 --> 02:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
mandate we were in significant
 
02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:19.910 align:start position:0%
mandate we were in significant
high

02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
high
 
02:44:23.830 --> 02:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
surging and we are getting better so i
 
02:44:26.070 --> 02:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
your your comment would you not say that
 
02:44:28.389 --> 02:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
your comment that um
 
02:44:30.389 --> 02:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
mask is not showing this is not
 
02:44:33.030 --> 02:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily accurate
 
02:44:34.469 --> 02:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
02:44:34.479 --> 02:44:35.670 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
representative

02:44:35.670 --> 02:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:44:37.349 --> 02:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
um i
 
02:44:40.389 --> 02:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
did not uh i put the date on there so
 
02:44:42.309 --> 02:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
that you know that it was
 
02:44:45.510 --> 02:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
that was the date and it's it's the rate
 
02:44:47.429 --> 02:44:47.439 align:start position:0%
that's being
 
02:44:50.790 --> 02:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
the rate per thousand is is what i'm
 
02:44:53.269 --> 02:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
what i the parent the uh
 
02:44:55.269 --> 02:44:55.279 align:start position:0%
parameters that we're using
 
02:44:55.279 --> 02:44:57.750 align:start position:0%
parameters that we're using
so

02:44:57.750 --> 02:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:01.910 --> 02:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
it was a random date um and that is
 
02:45:05.190 --> 02:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
it could be getting better follow-up sir
 
02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:05.990 align:start position:0%
it could be getting better follow-up sir
yes

02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:45:08.309 --> 02:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
02:45:08.319 --> 02:45:11.910 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
the

02:45:11.910 --> 02:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:14.230 --> 02:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
kind of put this into a proper question
 
02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:17.429 align:start position:0%
kind of put this into a proper question
um

02:45:17.429 --> 02:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:20.389 --> 02:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
if if this did show that it was getting
 
02:45:21.910 --> 02:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
better would you
 
02:45:24.389 --> 02:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable with changing your
 
02:45:24.399 --> 02:45:26.710 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable with changing your
statement

02:45:26.710 --> 02:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
statement
 
02:45:29.349 --> 02:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question changing
 
02:45:31.990 --> 02:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
changing my amendment no changing your
 
02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:33.269 align:start position:0%
changing my amendment no changing your
statement

02:45:33.269 --> 02:45:33.279 align:start position:0%
statement
 
02:45:35.429 --> 02:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
that that this map showed that they're
 
02:45:38.469 --> 02:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
so the i'm just not sure if i understand
 
02:45:42.070 --> 02:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
the question if we looked at the map
 
02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:43.510 align:start position:0%
the question if we looked at the map
today

02:45:43.510 --> 02:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:45.429 align:start position:0%
today
no

02:45:45.429 --> 02:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
i had commented prior that
 
02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
when the math mandate was put in in
 
02:45:53.750 --> 02:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
january or actually december
 
02:45:56.870 --> 02:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
the numbers were per 100 000 were quite
 
02:46:00.309 --> 02:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
significantly higher than they are on
 
02:46:03.349 --> 02:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
210. i have those numbers um
 
02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
would you not say that your statement
 
02:46:06.950 --> 02:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
was not quite as accurate as you would
 
02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:10.150 align:start position:0%
was not quite as accurate as you would
hope

02:46:10.150 --> 02:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:11.990 --> 02:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i
 
02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:13.510 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i
uh

02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:46:15.910 --> 02:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
i no no i would not agree with that
 
02:46:15.920 --> 02:46:17.349 align:start position:0%
i no no i would not agree with that
because

02:46:17.349 --> 02:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm simply showing you a snapshot
 
02:46:22.150 --> 02:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
and saying that there wasn't anything
 
02:46:25.190 --> 02:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
that jumped out as overwhelmingly
 
02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
showing that the cities with mass
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
mandates not not the state as as overall
 
02:46:32.469 --> 02:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
and don't forget
 
02:46:35.349 --> 02:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh some of them are in various degrees
 
02:46:35.359 --> 02:46:36.389 align:start position:0%
uh some of them are in various degrees
they've

02:46:36.389 --> 02:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
they've
 
02:46:38.630 --> 02:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
had mass mandates last winter they took
 
02:46:40.950 --> 02:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
them away they put them back i think
 
02:46:42.790 --> 02:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
that was
 
02:46:45.110 --> 02:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
hanover that did that i'm not sure about
 
02:46:47.910 --> 02:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
the other ones and i haven't done a
 
02:46:51.670 --> 02:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
a great study of whether or not they uh
 
02:46:53.190 --> 02:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
show promise and it it's quite
 
02:46:55.670 --> 02:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
complicated the science and the data
 
02:46:57.269 --> 02:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
that's that's all
 
02:46:57.279 --> 02:46:58.150 align:start position:0%
that's that's all
um

02:46:58.150 --> 02:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm not an expert for sure i'm going
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
to claim to be represented
 
02:47:05.269 --> 02:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chu thank you for taking my
 
02:47:08.309 --> 02:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
question my question is simple in terms
 
02:47:08.319 --> 02:47:09.269 align:start position:0%
question my question is simple in terms
of

02:47:09.269 --> 02:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:47:13.030 --> 02:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
your built uh 1268
 
02:47:16.870 --> 02:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
is trying to take away the local control
 
02:47:19.269 --> 02:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
flip it around and say state has more
 
02:47:21.670 --> 02:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
control over the local ordinance is that
 
02:47:21.680 --> 02:47:24.070 align:start position:0%
control over the local ordinance is that
true

02:47:24.070 --> 02:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:25.110 --> 02:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
02:47:27.590 --> 02:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
02:47:29.349 --> 02:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
well what i
 
02:47:31.510 --> 02:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
said was that we have dylan's rule in
 
02:47:32.550 --> 02:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:33.590 align:start position:0%
the state
which

02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:47:37.510 --> 02:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
preempts any state city rule um
 
02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
we all automatically the way we're set
 
02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:40.870 align:start position:0%
we all automatically the way we're set
up

02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:47:42.550 --> 02:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
have the control the legislature has the
 
02:47:44.469 --> 02:47:44.479 align:start position:0%
control to make the laws
 
02:47:44.479 --> 02:47:45.510 align:start position:0%
control to make the laws
and

02:47:45.510 --> 02:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:47:48.309 --> 02:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
this ordinance is is really just i
 
02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
consider it housekeeping to better
 
02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:51.990 align:start position:0%
consider it housekeeping to better
define

02:47:51.990 --> 02:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
define
 
02:47:54.309 --> 02:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not taking away anything
 
02:47:54.319 --> 02:47:55.429 align:start position:0%
i'm not taking away anything
because

02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:47:57.830 --> 02:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
they already have all the abilities that
 
02:47:59.670 --> 02:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
they need to regulate all the public
 
02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:00.950 align:start position:0%
they need to regulate all the public
nuisances

02:48:00.950 --> 02:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
nuisances
 
02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
that they so choose if you read the
 
02:48:06.230 --> 02:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
entire chapter of 47
 
02:48:08.070 --> 02:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
it covers just about everything
 
02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:09.750 align:start position:0%
it covers just about everything
including

02:48:09.750 --> 02:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
including
 
02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:10.790 align:start position:0%
including
making

02:48:10.790 --> 02:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
making
 
02:48:14.630 --> 02:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
plain cards illegal and and regulating
 
02:48:18.630 --> 02:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
candle makers all the way back to 1846
 
02:48:21.110 --> 02:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
plus in in other sections of the rsa
 
02:48:23.590 --> 02:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of regulations this
 
02:48:26.389 --> 02:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
this only would define what kind of
 
02:48:26.399 --> 02:48:27.750 align:start position:0%
this only would define what kind of
regulations

02:48:27.750 --> 02:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
02:48:30.710 --> 02:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
they can pass
 
02:48:32.150 --> 02:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
and that is that's all it's just a
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:48:40.550 --> 02:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:48:44.070 --> 02:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:45.190 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
i

02:48:45.190 --> 02:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
looked at the
 
02:48:49.590 --> 02:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
the directive from the
 
02:48:51.590 --> 02:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
city of portsmouth
 
02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:52.790 align:start position:0%
city of portsmouth
and

02:48:52.790 --> 02:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:55.429 --> 02:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
i see that there is a paragraph
 
02:48:58.630 --> 02:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
it says a face covering is not required
 
02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
for a person
 
02:49:02.230 --> 02:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
with a medical or developmental
 
02:49:02.240 --> 02:49:03.830 align:start position:0%
with a medical or developmental
condition

02:49:03.830 --> 02:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
condition
 
02:49:07.070 --> 02:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
and you're not required to produce
 
02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:09.030 align:start position:0%
and you're not required to produce
documentation

02:49:09.030 --> 02:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
02:49:11.269 --> 02:49:11.279 align:start position:0%
now i am a person
 
02:49:12.870 --> 02:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
who has
 
02:49:16.070 --> 02:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
what's termed a cleft palate
 
02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:17.190 align:start position:0%
what's termed a cleft palate
okay

02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:49:20.389 --> 02:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
it makes it harder for me to breathe
 
02:49:22.710 --> 02:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
so i am not
 
02:49:26.950 --> 02:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
covered by any sort of mask mandate
 
02:49:30.550 --> 02:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
the problem for me to go into
 
02:49:34.950 --> 02:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
a city that has a mask mandate
 
02:49:37.349 --> 02:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
is that i personally
 
02:49:38.070 --> 02:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:39.510 align:start position:0%
have to
[Music]

02:49:39.510 --> 02:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:40.389 align:start position:0%
[Music]
tolerate

02:49:40.389 --> 02:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
tolerate
 
02:49:41.910 --> 02:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
the scorn
 
02:49:43.750 --> 02:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
and the bad
 
02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:45.190 align:start position:0%
and the bad
looks

02:49:45.190 --> 02:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
looks
 
02:49:47.750 --> 02:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
that i get
 
02:49:48.950 --> 02:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
from that
 
02:49:51.510 --> 02:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
would your bill
 
02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:52.830 align:start position:0%
would your bill
prohibit

02:49:52.830 --> 02:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
prohibit
 
02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:54.469 align:start position:0%
prohibit
the

02:49:54.469 --> 02:49:54.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:49:57.429 --> 02:49:57.439 align:start position:0%
me getting that scorn
 
02:50:00.870 --> 02:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
going into a a municipality that
 
02:50:04.469 --> 02:50:04.479 align:start position:0%
requires a mask mandate
 
02:50:05.429 --> 02:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
02:50:06.830 --> 02:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative los
 
02:50:08.710 --> 02:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
alas um
 
02:50:12.550 --> 02:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
so this this bill would prohibit cities
 
02:50:15.910 --> 02:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
from making mass mandates yes
 
02:50:18.389 --> 02:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
or any mandate uh
 
02:50:20.710 --> 02:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
pertaining to communicable diseases
 
02:50:23.830 --> 02:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
which would be the purview of dhhs
 
02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:24.950 align:start position:0%
which would be the purview of dhhs
so

02:50:24.950 --> 02:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:26.150 align:start position:0%
so
technically

02:50:26.150 --> 02:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
technically
 
02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
possibly the governor or
 
02:50:31.190 --> 02:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
at the state level we could pass mass
 
02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:32.550 align:start position:0%
at the state level we could pass mass
mandates

02:50:32.550 --> 02:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
02:50:36.950 --> 02:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
so i can't say for certain that um
 
02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
that would never happen
 
02:50:43.349 --> 02:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
but it would would allow it to happen at
 
02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
a state level
 
02:50:47.429 --> 02:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
rather than a city by city level thank
 
02:50:49.510 --> 02:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:50:51.429 --> 02:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
thank you and my question will be quick
 
02:50:53.349 --> 02:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned something that kind of
 
02:50:55.590 --> 02:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
triggered when you said the governor um
 
02:50:57.429 --> 02:50:57.439 align:start position:0%
the governor has actually come out and
 
02:51:00.150 --> 02:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
said that whatever the municipalities
 
02:51:02.550 --> 02:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
felt was necessary for the health of
 
02:51:02.560 --> 02:51:04.070 align:start position:0%
felt was necessary for the health of
their

02:51:04.070 --> 02:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:51:06.150 --> 02:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
could could in fact do mass mandates and
 
02:51:08.710 --> 02:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
so on he has not prohibited he said that
 
02:51:11.750 --> 02:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
he would not do it statewide um so would
 
02:51:15.269 --> 02:51:15.279 align:start position:0%
this prohibit him from saying that
 
02:51:18.870 --> 02:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
or any other future governor i apologize
 
02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um he did
 
02:51:24.389 --> 02:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
he did say that uh the governor i
 
02:51:24.399 --> 02:51:25.349 align:start position:0%
he did say that uh the governor i
believe

02:51:25.349 --> 02:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:51:27.670 --> 02:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
that i don't know whether that was after
 
02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
or before he as you recall
 
02:51:34.070 --> 02:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
did pass a sort of mask mandate for the
 
02:51:36.550 --> 02:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
state at for in a limited way
 
02:51:38.070 --> 02:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
at one time
 
02:51:41.110 --> 02:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
so i imagine that he could do that again
 
02:51:41.120 --> 02:51:42.150 align:start position:0%
so i imagine that he could do that again
um

02:51:42.150 --> 02:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:45.269 --> 02:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:47.510 --> 02:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure
 
02:51:49.429 --> 02:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
yeah he could i don't see why he
 
02:51:51.910 --> 02:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it again
 
02:51:54.230 --> 02:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
follow up sir
 
02:51:54.240 --> 02:51:55.429 align:start position:0%
follow up sir
yes

02:51:55.429 --> 02:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:51:55.439 --> 02:51:59.190 align:start position:0%
yes
um

02:51:59.190 --> 02:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
he he did it after he
 
02:52:04.950 --> 02:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
stopped hit the the statewide mandate
 
02:52:07.030 --> 02:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
and and then basically allowed the
 
02:52:09.590 --> 02:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
states to do it my question to you is
 
02:52:13.349 --> 02:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
would this prohibit him from
 
02:52:16.150 --> 02:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
without regulation stating oh any
 
02:52:19.269 --> 02:52:19.279 align:start position:0%
municipality as he has done presently
 
02:52:21.110 --> 02:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
any municipality
 
02:52:24.070 --> 02:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
can invoke um
 
02:52:26.309 --> 02:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
a something of a mandate of a mass
 
02:52:27.990 --> 02:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
mandate or something like that for the
 
02:52:31.670 --> 02:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:33.429 --> 02:52:33.439 align:start position:0%
if the if i understand the question
 
02:52:35.190 --> 02:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:52:37.990 --> 02:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
would this prohibit the governor from
 
02:52:41.349 --> 02:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
saying that a city can do this
 
02:52:43.670 --> 02:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
um i believe
 
02:52:46.389 --> 02:52:46.399 align:start position:0%
this would put the onus on
 
02:52:47.670 --> 02:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:52:50.309 --> 02:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
or the legislature
 
02:52:53.190 --> 02:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh to to deal with it at a state level
 
02:52:54.630 --> 02:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
and it would
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
i don't see how uh
 
02:52:59.349 --> 02:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
unless there's there's something more to
 
02:52:59.359 --> 02:53:00.550 align:start position:0%
unless there's there's something more to
the

02:53:00.550 --> 02:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:53:03.110 --> 02:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
to the to the regulation but it would it
 
02:53:06.230 --> 02:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
would stop that from yes just one quick
 
02:53:07.910 --> 02:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up and i apologize sir just for
 
02:53:07.920 --> 02:53:09.429 align:start position:0%
follow-up and i apologize sir just for
clarification

02:53:09.429 --> 02:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
02:53:11.590 --> 02:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay and and i apologize to you too i i
 
02:53:13.910 --> 02:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't mean to to keep keep asking you
 
02:53:15.910 --> 02:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
this um oh my god it just went out of my
 
02:53:17.750 --> 02:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
head um
 
02:53:19.990 --> 02:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
the um the
 
02:53:21.590 --> 02:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
you said that it would not
 
02:53:24.630 --> 02:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
so if this were to happen in
 
02:53:27.110 --> 02:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
october november when the
 
02:53:29.750 --> 02:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is not in
 
02:53:31.510 --> 02:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
in session they would have to call an
 
02:53:31.520 --> 02:53:34.389 align:start position:0%
in session they would have to call an
emergency

02:53:34.389 --> 02:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:37.349 --> 02:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
meeting in order to be able to pass
 
02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
02:53:41.670 --> 02:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
is that your intention
 
02:53:43.269 --> 02:53:43.279 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
02:53:46.469 --> 02:53:46.479 align:start position:0%
representative um is it my intention
 
02:53:46.479 --> 02:53:47.990 align:start position:0%
representative um is it my intention
that

02:53:47.990 --> 02:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:53:50.630 --> 02:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
the state go and and call for an
 
02:53:53.830 --> 02:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
emergency legislative session no
 
02:53:56.150 --> 02:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
i i don't think uh that would be
 
02:53:56.160 --> 02:53:57.670 align:start position:0%
i i don't think uh that would be
probably

02:53:57.670 --> 02:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:54:00.150 --> 02:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
something that they would do
 
02:54:04.630 --> 02:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
um so no they would not do that but um
 
02:54:07.990 --> 02:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know to on on a side note
 
02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh a governor can can say that they they
 
02:54:13.670 --> 02:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
wish that people would wear mass or to
 
02:54:16.790 --> 02:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
to maybe publish something
 
02:54:18.389 --> 02:54:18.399 align:start position:0%
some more guidance
 
02:54:21.590 --> 02:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh they could certainly publish guidance
 
02:54:24.150 --> 02:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
02:54:25.269 --> 02:54:25.279 align:start position:0%

02:54:38.630 --> 02:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
nuisances that interfere with the use
 
02:54:40.950 --> 02:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
or enjoyment of property my question is
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
about the word property is that personal
 
02:54:44.790 --> 02:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
property and
 
02:54:46.870 --> 02:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
municipal property is that all the
 
02:54:48.710 --> 02:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
property of the town i just want to be
 
02:54:50.710 --> 02:54:50.720 align:start position:0%

um when i when a word is not defined in

the common
 
02:55:06.389 --> 02:55:06.399 align:start position:0%

02:55:07.590 --> 02:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
of the term
 
02:55:07.600 --> 02:55:08.870 align:start position:0%
of the term
applies

02:55:08.870 --> 02:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
applies
 
02:55:11.429 --> 02:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
so um for the use and enjoyment of
 
02:55:11.439 --> 02:55:12.469 align:start position:0%
so um for the use and enjoyment of
property

02:55:12.469 --> 02:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:55:14.469 --> 02:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
it certainly uh
 
02:55:16.389 --> 02:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
pertains to private property because
 
02:55:18.469 --> 02:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
when you're discussing nuisances
 
02:55:21.830 --> 02:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
and um health officers and regulations
 
02:55:24.070 --> 02:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
they're often dealing with uh private
 
02:55:27.429 --> 02:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
property and dispute disputes between
 
02:55:29.429 --> 02:55:29.439 align:start position:0%
par you know landowners
 
02:55:29.439 --> 02:55:31.429 align:start position:0%
par you know landowners
um

02:55:31.429 --> 02:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:33.110 --> 02:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't see why it wouldn't apply
 
02:55:35.830 --> 02:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
to public property
 
02:55:38.389 --> 02:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:55:40.070 --> 02:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:55:45.910 --> 02:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:55.670 --> 02:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:57.349 --> 02:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman h grace for the
 
02:55:59.349 --> 02:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association we
 
02:56:01.269 --> 02:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill as written as well as
 
02:56:03.830 --> 02:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:04.550 align:start position:0%
the amendment
the

02:56:04.550 --> 02:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:56:06.550 --> 02:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment does address a number of
 
02:56:09.750 --> 02:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
our concerns with the bill is written
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
as i
 
02:56:13.190 --> 02:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's very similar to a bill previously
 
02:56:14.790 --> 02:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
heard by this committee relating to the
 
02:56:16.870 --> 02:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
authority of local health officers for
 
02:56:20.309 --> 02:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
towns um and uses terms like
 
02:56:22.710 --> 02:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
presenting a clear and present danger as
 
02:56:25.990 --> 02:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
well as uh limiting the time period for
 
02:56:27.590 --> 02:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
an ordinance for a certain period of
 
02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:28.710 align:start position:0%
an ordinance for a certain period of
time

02:56:28.710 --> 02:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:56:30.389 --> 02:56:30.399 align:start position:0%
as i explained in that prior hearing we
 
02:56:32.309 --> 02:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
think that's inappropriate i believe
 
02:56:33.670 --> 02:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
it's the sponsor's intent that the
 
02:56:36.710 --> 02:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
amendment would replace the entire bill
 
02:56:39.349 --> 02:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
or at least the problematic language
 
02:56:40.790 --> 02:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
and therefore i would like to address my
 
02:56:43.349 --> 02:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
comments towards that
 
02:56:46.190 --> 02:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
first i'd like to note that under
 
02:56:48.550 --> 02:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
rsa4717 roman
 
02:56:50.950 --> 02:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
14 there's already a provision that
 
02:56:53.349 --> 02:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
allows cities to abate and remove
 
02:56:55.030 --> 02:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
nuisances so
 
02:56:58.309 --> 02:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh this to to the extent that this
 
02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
language uh proposed today the abatement
 
02:57:02.790 --> 02:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
of nuisances that interfere with the use
 
02:57:05.590 --> 02:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
or enjoyment of property would be added
 
02:57:08.070 --> 02:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
that would be duplicative of what
 
02:57:10.550 --> 02:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
currently exists and may in fact
 
02:57:13.190 --> 02:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
restrict it to a specific property
 
02:57:14.790 --> 02:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
02:57:16.710 --> 02:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
however nuisances
 
02:57:18.630 --> 02:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
are interpreted
 
02:57:21.030 --> 02:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
and the way nuisance nuisance
 
02:57:23.030 --> 02:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
is interpreted at the moment
 
02:57:25.269 --> 02:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
is it really has to be
 
02:57:27.990 --> 02:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
clearly defined and so
 
02:57:30.309 --> 02:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
if i can use the city of nashua as an
 
02:57:30.319 --> 02:57:31.750 align:start position:0%
if i can use the city of nashua as an
example

02:57:31.750 --> 02:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:57:33.910 --> 02:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
they have a very
 
02:57:36.790 --> 02:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
robust process in order to enact some
 
02:57:39.110 --> 02:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
sort of local regulation
 
02:57:40.710 --> 02:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
um so if it's something that a health
 
02:57:42.550 --> 02:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
officer would propose
 
02:57:44.550 --> 02:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
they would you know have to
 
02:57:46.630 --> 02:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
write up the the wording and find a
 
02:57:48.309 --> 02:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
reason for it it would they'd have to
 
02:57:50.550 --> 02:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
find a sponsor on the city council
 
02:57:52.469 --> 02:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
the city council would debate that
 
02:57:55.349 --> 02:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
before putting it into action
 
02:57:56.790 --> 02:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:57:59.830 --> 02:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
you have all these sorts of local checks
 
02:58:01.830 --> 02:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
obviously there would be opportunity for
 
02:58:03.750 --> 02:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
the public to address the city council
 
02:58:06.309 --> 02:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
and express their opinion on the matter
 
02:58:08.230 --> 02:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
flush out any issues that might arise
 
02:58:11.110 --> 02:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
that might not be foreseen by uh
 
02:58:11.120 --> 02:58:11.910 align:start position:0%
that might not be foreseen by uh
the

02:58:11.910 --> 02:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:58:14.070 --> 02:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
local officials working on this
 
02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:14.870 align:start position:0%
local officials working on this
um

02:58:14.870 --> 02:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:16.630 --> 02:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
and so we are concerned that this would
 
02:58:19.190 --> 02:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
take away local authority
 
02:58:20.150 --> 02:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
i did
 
02:58:21.990 --> 02:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
just put out a question to our members
 
02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:23.190 align:start position:0%
just put out a question to our members
about

02:58:23.190 --> 02:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:58:24.630 --> 02:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
you know what
 
02:58:24.640 --> 02:58:26.070 align:start position:0%
you know what
what

02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:58:28.389 --> 02:58:28.399 align:start position:0%
specifically does this
 
02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
provision in the law has it been used
 
02:58:32.550 --> 02:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
for in the past
 
02:58:36.870 --> 02:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of cases on it um and
 
02:58:39.750 --> 02:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
really the cases are
 
02:58:41.670 --> 02:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
well the law's changed slightly since
 
02:58:43.910 --> 02:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
since the first case which is dover news
 
02:58:48.070 --> 02:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
inc versus city of dover 117 nh 1066
 
02:58:50.550 --> 02:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
from 1977 which saw the city of dover
 
02:58:52.230 --> 02:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
regulate the display of adult books and
 
02:58:55.590 --> 02:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
magazines at a newsstand
 
02:58:57.830 --> 02:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
the laws changed slightly there is now a
 
02:58:59.590 --> 02:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
provision that
 
02:59:03.670 --> 02:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
under 4717 roman 13 that allows that
 
02:59:06.790 --> 02:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
type of regulation specifically
 
02:59:09.269 --> 02:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
and this provision was also mentioned in
 
02:59:11.750 --> 02:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
the case state versus lilly
 
02:59:13.750 --> 02:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
i don't have the new hampshire citation
 
02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
but the
 
02:59:17.590 --> 02:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
regional citation is
 
02:59:19.510 --> 02:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
204 a
 
02:59:23.030 --> 02:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
3d 198 2019 which saw the city of
 
02:59:23.040 --> 02:59:24.150 align:start position:0%
3d 198 2019 which saw the city of
laconia

02:59:24.150 --> 02:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
laconia
 
02:59:28.550 --> 02:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
regulate uh topless female sunbathers um
 
02:59:30.309 --> 02:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
and that has
 
02:59:32.469 --> 02:59:32.479 align:start position:0%
and there's now a provision in the law
 
02:59:35.269 --> 02:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
that specifically addresses that as well
 
02:59:37.830 --> 02:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that was in in place as
 
02:59:37.840 --> 02:59:38.630 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that was in in place as
well

02:59:38.630 --> 02:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:59:42.630 --> 02:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
beforehand um but in any case um
 
02:59:45.190 --> 02:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
really this provisional law
 
02:59:48.070 --> 02:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
by and large has been used as supplement
 
02:59:50.269 --> 02:59:50.279 align:start position:0%
supplementary authority
 
02:59:53.030 --> 02:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
4717 covers a huge
 
02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
range of things that cities are allowed
 
02:59:56.790 --> 02:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
to to deal with
 
02:59:58.150 --> 02:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
they really are
 
03:00:00.469 --> 03:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
things that you would that just kind of
 
03:00:02.230 --> 03:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
the average citizen would think of
 
03:00:04.389 --> 03:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
calling their local officials about so
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's not something they would logically
 
03:00:07.429 --> 03:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
think about calling a state official
 
03:00:08.710 --> 03:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
about it's something they would call the
 
03:00:10.870 --> 03:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
city about and assume the city has the
 
03:00:12.790 --> 03:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
power to regulate you know
 
03:00:15.510 --> 03:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
trees on roads snow plowing etc all of
 
03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
that's covered under 47 17.
 
03:00:21.269 --> 03:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
the one area where it may be the case
 
03:00:25.269 --> 03:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
that this provision stands alone
 
03:00:27.910 --> 03:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
is something like dealing with uh
 
03:00:29.830 --> 03:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
in in the health context is some
 
03:00:32.790 --> 03:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
something like dealing with mosquitoes
 
03:00:34.950 --> 03:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
so for example concord and manchester
 
03:00:37.269 --> 03:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
have similar provisions
 
03:00:38.630 --> 03:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
i learned this morning dealing with
 
03:00:40.309 --> 03:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
mosquitoes and
 
03:00:42.070 --> 03:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
standing water so obviously if you have
 
03:00:43.750 --> 03:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
standing water mosquitoes can breed
 
03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:44.630 align:start position:0%
standing water mosquitoes can breed
there

03:00:44.630 --> 03:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
so they have ordinances in place to try
 
03:00:48.230 --> 03:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
to limit the amount of standing water
 
03:00:49.750 --> 03:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
around the city
 
03:00:51.429 --> 03:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
and in particular to some places like
 
03:00:53.269 --> 03:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
junkyards which see a lot of things like
 
03:00:55.590 --> 03:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
tires that collected standing water
 
03:00:58.630 --> 03:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
and in this in the region between
 
03:01:00.230 --> 03:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
concord and manchester they're dealing
 
03:01:00.240 --> 03:01:00.950 align:start position:0%
concord and manchester they're dealing
with

03:01:00.950 --> 03:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:01:02.550 --> 03:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
um kind of a
 
03:01:04.870 --> 03:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
seasonal outbreak of the james count
 
03:01:08.070 --> 03:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
jamestown canyon virus and some other
 
03:01:10.389 --> 03:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
viruses spread by mosquitoes
 
03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
obviously limiting the number of
 
03:01:13.830 --> 03:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
mosquitoes available limits the
 
03:01:17.510 --> 03:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:17.520 --> 03:01:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
salem

03:01:19.510 --> 03:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
salem
 
03:01:22.469 --> 03:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
using its its provisions as a a
 
03:01:24.070 --> 03:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
a council
 
03:01:26.630 --> 03:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
um has a uh
 
03:01:30.070 --> 03:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
a provision that requires testing of
 
03:01:32.070 --> 03:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
private wells when new homes are
 
03:01:33.670 --> 03:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
constructed to ensure that they provide
 
03:01:35.910 --> 03:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
safe water to the inhabitants there's
 
03:01:38.790 --> 03:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
currently no state provision on that
 
03:01:40.630 --> 03:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
so that would cover things and i'm not
 
03:01:42.950 --> 03:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
sure exactly how how much that covers
 
03:01:44.790 --> 03:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
but that could cover something like
 
03:01:47.110 --> 03:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
testing to see the level of pfas or the
 
03:01:49.110 --> 03:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
level of lead or arsenic
 
03:01:51.510 --> 03:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
etc and having that disclosed to new
 
03:01:54.070 --> 03:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
homeowners who would then presumably be
 
03:01:55.510 --> 03:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
able to negotiate with the builder and
 
03:01:58.469 --> 03:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
ensure that the water is safe to drink
 
03:01:59.990 --> 03:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
um certainly happy to answer any
 
03:02:03.670 --> 03:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
questions the committee may have
 
03:02:05.429 --> 03:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a break in just a
 
03:02:07.990 --> 03:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
few minutes could i ask you to hold for
 
03:02:10.630 --> 03:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
us to leave absolutely before you leave
 
03:02:14.870 --> 03:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely any questions for the nhma
 
03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:16.469 align:start position:0%
absolutely any questions for the nhma
yes

03:02:16.469 --> 03:02:16.479 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:02:16.479 --> 03:02:17.670 align:start position:0%
yes

jim
 
03:02:19.110 --> 03:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
03:02:21.030 --> 03:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
grace for taking my question
 
03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:22.309 align:start position:0%
grace for taking my question
um

03:02:22.309 --> 03:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:22.319 --> 03:02:23.590 align:start position:0%
um
if

03:02:23.590 --> 03:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:02:24.750 --> 03:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
03:02:29.110 --> 03:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
1272 as amended were to pass
 
03:02:32.550 --> 03:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
giving health officers the uh right for
 
03:02:35.590 --> 03:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh to deal with nuisances and house bill
 
03:02:38.389 --> 03:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
1268 as amended were to pass giving the
 
03:02:39.990 --> 03:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
city council
 
03:02:43.110 --> 03:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
the same authority to obey for nuisances
 
03:02:46.790 --> 03:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
god bless you would we have a conflict
 
03:02:49.030 --> 03:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
or would we have confusion
 
03:02:51.670 --> 03:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
about whose authority
 
03:02:54.230 --> 03:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
or who has the authority
 
03:02:56.710 --> 03:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
health officer or city council
 
03:03:00.710 --> 03:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question um
 
03:03:02.230 --> 03:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
you would certainly have a duplication
 
03:03:04.950 --> 03:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
of who has that authority um
 
03:03:06.870 --> 03:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
it it gets a little complex and how
 
03:03:09.670 --> 03:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
these relate um but again if i go back
 
03:03:12.230 --> 03:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
to my example of the city of nashua
 
03:03:14.309 --> 03:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
typically the health officer themselves
 
03:03:16.389 --> 03:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
aren't making regulations in a city
 
03:03:18.630 --> 03:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
context typically they're doing it
 
03:03:18.640 --> 03:03:20.389 align:start position:0%
context typically they're doing it
through

03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:03:22.790 --> 03:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
the city council's process
 
03:03:22.800 --> 03:03:23.990 align:start position:0%
the city council's process
so

03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:03:25.190 --> 03:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
03:03:27.030 --> 03:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
that concerned about the any sort of
 
03:03:29.590 --> 03:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
conflicting language between those two
 
03:03:32.070 --> 03:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
um i would add however we we also object
 
03:03:36.150 --> 03:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:39.269 --> 03:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
any other comments yes representative
 
03:03:41.190 --> 03:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr grace
 
03:03:45.110 --> 03:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question my question is um
 
03:03:48.469 --> 03:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
how does this flip the state versus
 
03:03:51.190 --> 03:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
local control and how would it
 
03:03:51.200 --> 03:03:52.469 align:start position:0%
local control and how would it
jeopardize

03:03:52.469 --> 03:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
jeopardize
 
03:03:55.030 --> 03:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
local control
 
03:03:56.630 --> 03:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
well representative i think you had it
 
03:03:58.309 --> 03:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
exactly right earlier when you asked the
 
03:04:00.230 --> 03:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor that this does take away local
 
03:04:00.240 --> 03:04:01.510 align:start position:0%
sponsor that this does take away local
control

03:04:01.510 --> 03:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
control
 
03:04:04.950 --> 03:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know local authorities are granted
 
03:04:08.150 --> 03:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
a limited yet broad grant of power in
 
03:04:10.070 --> 03:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
certain areas simply because we can't
 
03:04:11.990 --> 03:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
anticipate the issues that are going to
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
come up um
 
03:04:17.269 --> 03:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
the the two case examples i i came up
 
03:04:19.990 --> 03:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
with probably not something that the
 
03:04:22.150 --> 03:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
legislature thought about ahead of time
 
03:04:23.910 --> 03:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
until it was an issue
 
03:04:25.510 --> 03:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
and this just gives
 
03:04:27.190 --> 03:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities the option to deal with
 
03:04:29.990 --> 03:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
that and of course the check is that the
 
03:04:31.830 --> 03:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
next session the legislature comes in
 
03:04:34.830 --> 03:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
and decides whether that was dealt with
 
03:04:37.510 --> 03:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
appropriately thank you um
 
03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:38.710 align:start position:0%
appropriately thank you um
and

03:04:38.710 --> 03:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:04:42.950 --> 03:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
is it not true that we are the pandemic
 
03:04:44.550 --> 03:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
this is the first time we have had a
 
03:04:47.269 --> 03:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic at least since i've lived in
 
03:04:49.429 --> 03:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
here for a few decades
 
03:04:51.830 --> 03:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:04:55.429 --> 03:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
you know to change something
 
03:04:57.030 --> 03:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
that not knowing if you're going to have
 
03:04:59.510 --> 03:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
another pandemic or not
 
03:05:02.790 --> 03:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that mute the
 
03:05:06.309 --> 03:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:08.550 --> 03:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
i thank you for the question so i i
 
03:05:10.790 --> 03:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
guess to paraphrase what
 
03:05:13.030 --> 03:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's comments were as far as i
 
03:05:15.910 --> 03:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
understand them at his several thursday
 
03:05:17.670 --> 03:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon briefings that i watched where
 
03:05:19.269 --> 03:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
he addressed the issue
 
03:05:19.279 --> 03:05:20.469 align:start position:0%
he addressed the issue
um

03:05:20.469 --> 03:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:22.150 --> 03:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
he believed it was appropriate to deal
 
03:05:24.389 --> 03:05:24.399 align:start position:0%
with this at the local level with regard
 
03:05:26.790 --> 03:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
to the masking because local conditions
 
03:05:29.269 --> 03:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
are different so some place like
 
03:05:31.269 --> 03:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
you know hanover obviously it's the
 
03:05:32.790 --> 03:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
center of dartmouth hitchcock large
 
03:05:32.800 --> 03:05:33.830 align:start position:0%
center of dartmouth hitchcock large
hospital

03:05:33.830 --> 03:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
03:05:35.510 --> 03:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know you don't want doctors getting
 
03:05:37.750 --> 03:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
sick during a health out during a health
 
03:05:39.670 --> 03:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
crisis you need them to care for the
 
03:05:39.680 --> 03:05:40.870 align:start position:0%
crisis you need them to care for the
populace

03:05:40.870 --> 03:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
populace
 
03:05:43.030 --> 03:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
more broadly but you might not have that
 
03:05:45.510 --> 03:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
same kind of concern you know outside
 
03:05:48.469 --> 03:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
that immediate area so a few towns away
 
03:05:50.790 --> 03:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
it might not be appropriate it might not
 
03:05:52.469 --> 03:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
be something that that is and i think
 
03:05:54.389 --> 03:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
that towns have used
 
03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
their authority very judiciously and had
 
03:05:59.429 --> 03:05:59.439 align:start position:0%
public quite a lot of public comment i
 
03:06:01.349 --> 03:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
can tell you because i've heard about it
 
03:06:03.910 --> 03:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
um and made decisions based on what the
 
03:06:07.349 --> 03:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
people of their municipality want
 
03:06:10.790 --> 03:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
any additional questions to hma
 
03:06:13.510 --> 03:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
03:06:13.520 --> 03:06:15.429 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
next

03:06:15.429 --> 03:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
next
 
03:06:19.990 --> 03:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:21.670 --> 03:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
did i pronounce your name correctly you
 
03:06:24.230 --> 03:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
did you been right yes
 
03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
all right good morning again chair and
 
03:06:28.950 --> 03:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
committee members uh just to reintroduce
 
03:06:31.349 --> 03:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
myself my name is christina dubin i am
 
03:06:33.510 --> 03:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
volunteer secretary and campaigns
 
03:06:35.750 --> 03:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the surfrider foundation
 
03:06:38.309 --> 03:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire chapter and i also have
 
03:06:40.950 --> 03:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
the privilege of living in portsmouth
 
03:06:45.269 --> 03:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
so our chapter is opposed to hb 1268. um
 
03:06:47.510 --> 03:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
the goal of this bill is identical to
 
03:06:50.309 --> 03:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
multiple bills before it including hb
 
03:06:52.950 --> 03:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
439 which failed last session
 
03:06:54.469 --> 03:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
and it seeks of course to limit the
 
03:06:54.479 --> 03:06:55.590 align:start position:0%
and it seeks of course to limit the
scope

03:06:55.590 --> 03:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
scope
 
03:06:57.590 --> 03:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
of city councils
 
03:07:01.030 --> 03:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
it takes aim at strengthening rsa 4717
 
03:07:03.510 --> 03:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
but does so in an unreasonable and
 
03:07:05.990 --> 03:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
overbearing manner by adding a time
 
03:07:08.309 --> 03:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
period of 10 days and increasing the
 
03:07:11.269 --> 03:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
limitation of the scope of authority to
 
03:07:13.349 --> 03:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
quote locations that present a clear and
 
03:07:16.070 --> 03:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
present danger to the city unquote the
 
03:07:18.230 --> 03:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
state of course would be sought after to
 
03:07:20.150 --> 03:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
resolve many issues that required an
 
03:07:22.070 --> 03:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
extended time period beyond those 10
 
03:07:22.080 --> 03:07:23.110 align:start position:0%
extended time period beyond those 10
days

03:07:23.110 --> 03:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
days
 
03:07:25.190 --> 03:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
and it would create a need to arbitrate
 
03:07:27.349 --> 03:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
every instance of what constitutes that
 
03:07:27.359 --> 03:07:28.230 align:start position:0%
every instance of what constitutes that
that

03:07:28.230 --> 03:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:07:30.469 --> 03:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
clear and present danger
 
03:07:33.510 --> 03:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
we have 234 municipalities and 25
 
03:07:35.910 --> 03:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
unincorporated places that vary in their
 
03:07:37.910 --> 03:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
demographics economics culture and
 
03:07:37.920 --> 03:07:39.269 align:start position:0%
demographics economics culture and
geography

03:07:39.269 --> 03:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
geography
 
03:07:40.870 --> 03:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
and so it's necessary for local
 
03:07:42.710 --> 03:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
governments to maintain their current
 
03:07:45.030 --> 03:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
authorities to make timely decisions in
 
03:07:47.349 --> 03:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
response to unique situations which
 
03:07:49.510 --> 03:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
arise in their communities
 
03:07:51.510 --> 03:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's of course already provided by
 
03:07:53.590 --> 03:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
statute that local policy must not
 
03:07:55.990 --> 03:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
directly contradict the state
 
03:07:58.150 --> 03:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
constitution or laws
 
03:08:00.469 --> 03:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
and so attempting to require explicit
 
03:08:02.469 --> 03:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
authority for all municipal matters is
 
03:08:05.190 --> 03:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
really creating an undue burden
 
03:08:07.510 --> 03:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
for all every level of government and
 
03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
also on the liberties of new hampshire
 
03:08:09.760 --> 03:08:10.950 align:start position:0%
also on the liberties of new hampshire
people

03:08:10.950 --> 03:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:08:13.110 --> 03:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of examples where
 
03:08:15.190 --> 03:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities are in for afforded
 
03:08:16.790 --> 03:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
inherent authority to carry out
 
03:08:19.510 --> 03:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
ordinances under their respective rsas
 
03:08:21.830 --> 03:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i'll just give you a few examples to
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
add to the ones already given
 
03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
workforce housing ordinances under rsa
 
03:08:26.399 --> 03:08:28.870 align:start position:0%
workforce housing ordinances under rsa
674-58

03:08:28.870 --> 03:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
674-58
 
03:08:31.349 --> 03:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
also within zoning and planning
 
03:08:33.510 --> 03:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
inherent authority is given in land use
 
03:08:33.520 --> 03:08:34.710 align:start position:0%
inherent authority is given in land use
boards

03:08:34.710 --> 03:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
boards
 
03:08:36.950 --> 03:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
and the last example i'll offer is of
 
03:08:39.670 --> 03:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
course within 149-m which we just heard
 
03:08:44.389 --> 03:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
about with bill hb 1119
 
03:08:46.070 --> 03:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
in that regard municipalities have
 
03:08:47.990 --> 03:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
existing authority to regulate solid
 
03:08:50.150 --> 03:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
waste and therefore inherent authority
 
03:08:52.469 --> 03:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
to classify specific items within the
 
03:08:54.230 --> 03:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
state's definition
 
03:08:56.550 --> 03:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
and clarity there is needed because
 
03:08:58.469 --> 03:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
there is a demonstrated need to resolve
 
03:08:58.479 --> 03:08:59.750 align:start position:0%
there is a demonstrated need to resolve
ambiguity

03:08:59.750 --> 03:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
ambiguity
 
03:09:02.070 --> 03:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
but by modifying our state law in a
 
03:09:05.590 --> 03:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
sweeping manner as hb 1268 would do
 
03:09:08.230 --> 03:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
again just causes unnecessary and
 
03:09:10.230 --> 03:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
burdensome oversight
 
03:09:10.240 --> 03:09:11.670 align:start position:0%
burdensome oversight
um

03:09:11.670 --> 03:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:13.510 --> 03:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
really onto every single letter of local
 
03:09:15.990 --> 03:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
law where that is just not needed it
 
03:09:17.590 --> 03:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
would bog down the state local
 
03:09:19.349 --> 03:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
governments and citizens with the
 
03:09:21.910 --> 03:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
minutia of municipalities and it
 
03:09:23.750 --> 03:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately just demonstrates a lack of
 
03:09:28.070 --> 03:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:29.670 --> 03:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
i'll just end by saying it would also
 
03:09:32.469 --> 03:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
cost the state more money which uh we
 
03:09:34.550 --> 03:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
really don't have to spend so i just
 
03:09:36.309 --> 03:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
urge the committee as it has done in the
 
03:09:38.950 --> 03:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
past to vote this bill itl
 
03:09:40.150 --> 03:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:09:43.269 --> 03:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
03:09:44.389 --> 03:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
03:09:46.070 --> 03:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
see none thank you so much thank you i
 
03:09:50.309 --> 03:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:51.670 --> 03:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
03:09:55.590 --> 03:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:10.229 --> 03:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:12.790 --> 03:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
just uh we're not taking the
 
03:10:14.150 --> 03:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
department of uh health and human
 
03:10:16.389 --> 03:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
services isn't taking a position on this
 
03:10:17.910 --> 03:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
particular bill we want to talk about
 
03:10:19.510 --> 03:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
the bill and and some of the concerns
 
03:10:21.670 --> 03:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
that we had um the most recent version
 
03:10:23.349 --> 03:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill which i got last night that
 
03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:29.110 --> 03:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
anything which seems uh for the
 
03:10:30.870 --> 03:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
well-being of the city and then adds in
 
03:10:32.070 --> 03:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
the abatement of nuisances that
 
03:10:33.510 --> 03:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
interfere with the use of the enjoyment
 
03:10:35.269 --> 03:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
of the property
 
03:10:37.269 --> 03:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
at this time the esu understands the
 
03:10:39.590 --> 03:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor wants to make the law consistent
 
03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
between towns and cities and so it's
 
03:10:43.349 --> 03:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
added this reference to specific
 
03:10:43.359 --> 03:10:44.870 align:start position:0%
added this reference to specific
nuisances

03:10:44.870 --> 03:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
nuisances
 
03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
the only concern is the bill eliminates
 
03:10:48.309 --> 03:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
a phrase
 
03:10:50.070 --> 03:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
which seems for the well-being of the
 
03:10:51.670 --> 03:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
city and replaces it with the abatement
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
of nuisances at a specific property um
 
03:10:55.670 --> 03:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
and they had the discussion a little
 
03:10:57.190 --> 03:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
while ago about a property it can be
 
03:10:58.710 --> 03:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
private property it could be the self it
 
03:11:00.630 --> 03:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
can be public property might even be
 
03:11:01.910 --> 03:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
shared media
 
03:11:04.389 --> 03:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
like air water things of that sort
 
03:11:06.550 --> 03:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
and i think the change really is that it
 
03:11:08.630 --> 03:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
shows kind of originally the well-being
 
03:11:10.469 --> 03:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
of the city is about the people and i
 
03:11:12.309 --> 03:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
think the change makes it kind of more
 
03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
about the location the nuisance of a
 
03:11:15.670 --> 03:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
particular property so i just want you
 
03:11:18.550 --> 03:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
to be aware that that's a change um
 
03:11:20.150 --> 03:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
and you may be more interested in
 
03:11:21.670 --> 03:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
protecting the health officers are about
 
03:11:23.990 --> 03:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
the population that they control not
 
03:11:26.469 --> 03:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
control that they protect
 
03:11:27.750 --> 03:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
and manage it
 
03:11:30.630 --> 03:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
dhhs doesn't see a significant impact on
 
03:11:32.550 --> 03:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
public health from this change or
 
03:11:35.670 --> 03:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
restriction to creating a health code
 
03:11:37.590 --> 03:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
as i say we're not sure exactly what it
 
03:11:39.510 --> 03:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
would create but we're not seeing a
 
03:11:42.070 --> 03:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
significant problem at this time
 
03:11:43.590 --> 03:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
you know we want to give health officers
 
03:11:45.510 --> 03:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
and support them in being able to do
 
03:11:47.910 --> 03:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
their job sometimes as broad authority
 
03:11:49.590 --> 03:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the next hazard or
 
03:11:51.830 --> 03:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
nuisance is going to be
 
03:11:53.990 --> 03:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
and we want to mature health officers
 
03:11:55.429 --> 03:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
who are on the ground and really see
 
03:11:57.590 --> 03:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
what's happening in their own cities
 
03:11:59.590 --> 03:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
understand know their neighbors have the
 
03:12:01.349 --> 03:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
ability to do that so i'm happy to take
 
03:12:02.950 --> 03:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
any questions you have specific about
 
03:12:04.550 --> 03:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
these changes or about
 
03:12:06.469 --> 03:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
the law could you state your name for
 
03:12:09.429 --> 03:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
the record yes matthew k helene from new
 
03:12:11.110 --> 03:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh department of health and
 
03:12:12.710 --> 03:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
human services
 
03:12:15.190 --> 03:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
you don't have a car
 
03:12:17.590 --> 03:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
i have a question
 
03:12:18.550 --> 03:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
03:12:18.560 --> 03:12:19.349 align:start position:0%
go ahead
um

03:12:19.349 --> 03:12:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:22.469 --> 03:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
i just couldn't you don't have position
 
03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
or you're opposing or supporting we're
 
03:12:26.469 --> 03:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
not taking a position was providing
 
03:12:30.630 --> 03:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:33.590 --> 03:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further
 
03:12:33.600 --> 03:12:35.670 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further
questions

03:12:35.670 --> 03:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question can you
 
03:12:39.670 --> 03:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
repeat what you said about the i'm sorry
 
03:12:41.510 --> 03:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
here i'm hiding behind your chair thank
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
you um
 
03:12:46.389 --> 03:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
can you repeat uh what you said about
 
03:12:49.750 --> 03:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
the um this is covering particular
 
03:12:51.910 --> 03:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
property or particular buildings and
 
03:12:51.920 --> 03:12:53.030 align:start position:0%
property or particular buildings and
places

03:12:53.030 --> 03:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
places
 
03:12:54.950 --> 03:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned something about not
 
03:12:56.309 --> 03:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
air or
 
03:12:58.830 --> 03:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
water supply or something like that can
 
03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
you explain can you repeat what you said
 
03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah let me try to describe the
 
03:13:05.990 --> 03:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
difference between um the original law
 
03:13:09.030 --> 03:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
um as it currently is which may seem
 
03:13:10.550 --> 03:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
for the well-being in the city right so
 
03:13:11.910 --> 03:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
when i think of the city i think the
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
population of the city and all of its
 
03:13:15.510 --> 03:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
environments things of that sort
 
03:13:17.190 --> 03:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
that's being changed to abatement of
 
03:13:19.269 --> 03:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
nuisances that interfere with the use or
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
enjoyment of the property and as we
 
03:13:22.309 --> 03:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
discussed somebody mentioned they
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
thought that property really was talking
 
03:13:26.630 --> 03:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
about either private property the self
 
03:13:28.790 --> 03:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
property public property and it may
 
03:13:30.790 --> 03:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
include media right it could property
 
03:13:32.870 --> 03:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
could be viewed as air water waste
 
03:13:34.389 --> 03:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
things of that sort the way we look at
 
03:13:35.990 --> 03:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
it because things can move between those
 
03:13:38.070 --> 03:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
right pests can move and infections can
 
03:13:39.910 --> 03:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
move odors and other things can move
 
03:13:41.670 --> 03:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
between those so i was just trying to
 
03:13:43.349 --> 03:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
get a broad picture of all the different
 
03:13:46.389 --> 03:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
types of property i feel like
 
03:13:48.389 --> 03:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
most things are property and could be
 
03:13:48.399 --> 03:13:49.590 align:start position:0%
most things are property and could be
managed

03:13:49.590 --> 03:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
managed
 
03:13:51.269 --> 03:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
there are things that aren't necessarily
 
03:13:51.279 --> 03:13:54.150 align:start position:0%
there are things that aren't necessarily
nuisances

03:13:54.150 --> 03:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:56.229 --> 03:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
nature grace mentioned the issue of
 
03:13:58.870 --> 03:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
arbor viral disease and the need to
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
remove standing water right stagnant
 
03:14:02.790 --> 03:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
water well there's no risk there yet
 
03:14:04.309 --> 03:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
right there's no nuisance there yet
 
03:14:05.910 --> 03:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
there's just
 
03:14:08.229 --> 03:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
a media which could grow those eggs of
 
03:14:10.150 --> 03:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
the mosquitoes and spread them so is
 
03:14:11.670 --> 03:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
that a nuisance or not i don't know
 
03:14:13.349 --> 03:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
would a health officer be able to
 
03:14:15.510 --> 03:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
would be they be able to control that
 
03:14:17.269 --> 03:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
based on the definition of it not being
 
03:14:18.630 --> 03:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
a nuisance those are some of the
 
03:14:22.630 --> 03:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
concerns that dhhs has thank you
 
03:14:24.389 --> 03:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
03:14:26.229 --> 03:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
03:14:28.710 --> 03:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you very much
 
03:14:31.110 --> 03:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
it just was a point of interest a little
 
03:14:33.110 --> 03:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier about
 
03:14:33.120 --> 03:14:34.469 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier about
pandemics

03:14:34.469 --> 03:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
pandemics
 
03:14:34.479 --> 03:14:36.070 align:start position:0%
pandemics
the

03:14:36.070 --> 03:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:14:39.429 --> 03:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
previous pandemic we had most
 
03:14:41.110 --> 03:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
most previous
 
03:14:45.670 --> 03:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
was the was the 1918 endemic
 
03:14:47.349 --> 03:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
where about one third of the world's
 
03:14:49.590 --> 03:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
population died
 
03:14:51.750 --> 03:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
and uh there was something before that
 
03:14:53.110 --> 03:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
there was something called the black
 
03:14:53.120 --> 03:14:54.469 align:start position:0%
there was something called the black
death

03:14:54.469 --> 03:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
death
 
03:14:57.910 --> 03:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:57.920 --> 03:15:00.630 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:15:00.630 --> 03:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:03.269 --> 03:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
okay so so we're gonna take uh
 
03:15:05.750 --> 03:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
a break and ask you all the committee
 
03:15:08.150 --> 03:15:08.160 align:start position:0%

i'm introducing house bill 1289

04:06:19.429 --> 04:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:06:22.550 --> 04:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
an act relative to the applications for
 
04:06:25.030 --> 04:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
abatements and authority to abate prior
 
04:06:29.349 --> 04:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:29.359 --> 04:06:30.469 align:start position:0%
 
actually

04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
really what the bill is if you read the
 
04:06:34.630 --> 04:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
analysis the bill provides for a good
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
cause for tax abatement under rsa 76
 
04:06:38.880 --> 04:06:40.389 align:start position:0%
cause for tax abatement under rsa 76
16.

04:06:40.389 --> 04:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
16.
 
04:06:40.399 --> 04:06:41.349 align:start position:0%
16.
shall

04:06:41.349 --> 04:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
shall
 
04:06:44.070 --> 04:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
shall include allowed recreational
 
04:06:47.670 --> 04:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
use of ohrvs on class 5 and class 6
 
04:06:47.680 --> 04:06:48.950 align:start position:0%
use of ohrvs on class 5 and class 6
roads

04:06:48.950 --> 04:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
roads
 
04:06:51.110 --> 04:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
i kind of wish that that analysis had
 
04:06:53.429 --> 04:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
been in the title it had a lot more
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
people to
 
04:06:57.590 --> 04:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
show up to testify but then maybe
 
04:06:59.830 --> 04:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
you know you don't need a you need a
 
04:07:04.870 --> 04:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:05.910 --> 04:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
i wish
 
04:07:07.429 --> 04:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
04:07:09.990 --> 04:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill
 
04:07:12.389 --> 04:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
is to provide some equitable relief for
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
those who have lost a significant part
 
04:07:17.269 --> 04:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
of the use enjoyment of their home
 
04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
due to actions of government local
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
and state
 
04:07:24.550 --> 04:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
the issue is two conflicting
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
activities a high impact noisy
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
recreational activity
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
and a quiet residential activity
 
04:07:37.670 --> 04:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
let's step back a few decades
 
04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
some of us can recall when vehicular
 
04:07:42.309 --> 04:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
recreation in the wild areas was very
 
04:07:42.319 --> 04:07:43.429 align:start position:0%
recreation in the wild areas was very
limited

04:07:43.429 --> 04:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
limited
 
04:07:43.439 --> 04:07:44.309 align:start position:0%
limited
many

04:07:44.309 --> 04:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
many
 
04:07:45.510 --> 04:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
maybe some
 
04:07:47.830 --> 04:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
dirt bikes or dune buggies but they
 
04:07:50.229 --> 04:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
weren't prolific and limited to private
 
04:07:50.239 --> 04:07:51.349 align:start position:0%
weren't prolific and limited to private
property

04:07:51.349 --> 04:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:07:54.389 --> 04:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
then along came the atvs and with them
 
04:07:57.269 --> 04:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
the pressure to use them on trails in
 
04:07:57.279 --> 04:07:58.070 align:start position:0%
the pressure to use them on trails in
this

04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:08:00.149 --> 04:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
in the summer like snowmobiles are used
 
04:08:02.229 --> 04:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
in the winter
 
04:08:02.239 --> 04:08:03.110 align:start position:0%
in the winter
we

04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:08:06.149 --> 04:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
it used to be that the ohrv
 
04:08:08.070 --> 04:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
which is the off-highway recreational
 
04:08:08.080 --> 04:08:09.110 align:start position:0%
which is the off-highway recreational
vehicle

04:08:09.110 --> 04:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
04:08:12.389 --> 04:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh was used on trails either in on state
 
04:08:15.590 --> 04:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
land or on private land with permission
 
04:08:18.550 --> 04:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
then we opened jericho state park
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
which was dedicated to ohrv use
 
04:08:24.149 --> 04:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
and the people came
 
04:08:26.950 --> 04:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
the sport became more popular
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
very popular the types of vehicles grew
 
04:08:33.189 --> 04:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
including four seat dune buggies
 
04:08:33.199 --> 04:08:34.149 align:start position:0%
including four seat dune buggies
types

04:08:34.149 --> 04:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
types
 
04:08:37.670 --> 04:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:41.429 --> 04:08:41.439 align:start position:0%
and when then the great idea
 
04:08:44.229 --> 04:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
connect all the trails so you can have
 
04:08:48.550 --> 04:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
1 000 miles of trails ride the wild
 
04:08:51.590 --> 04:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
but you had to connect all these trails
 
04:08:53.830 --> 04:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
how about letting them
 
04:08:56.950 --> 04:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
on a few of public roads
 
04:08:59.670 --> 04:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
but it was only a few public roles at
 
04:08:59.680 --> 04:09:00.550 align:start position:0%
but it was only a few public roles at
first

04:09:00.550 --> 04:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:09:03.510 --> 04:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
but then as some
 
04:09:04.950 --> 04:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
as someone
 
04:09:07.590 --> 04:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
could see the economic potential
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
of letting all the riders there coming
 
04:09:13.030 --> 04:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
in to spend their money in command and
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
spend their money in town
 
04:09:18.309 --> 04:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
other roads were open to ohrv traffic by
 
04:09:19.910 --> 04:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
local officials
 
04:09:22.469 --> 04:09:22.479 align:start position:0%
class 5 and class 6 roads
 
04:09:24.469 --> 04:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
and we're not talking about small
 
04:09:24.479 --> 04:09:26.389 align:start position:0%
and we're not talking about small
numbers

04:09:26.389 --> 04:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
04:09:29.910 --> 04:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
so now we have a high impact
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
recreational use
 
04:09:34.790 --> 04:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
impacting on low in on a low impact
 
04:09:36.790 --> 04:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
residential use
 
04:09:39.349 --> 04:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
consider this
 
04:09:41.349 --> 04:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
when did public roads become
 
04:09:44.149 --> 04:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
recreational areas
 
04:09:46.070 --> 04:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
they're not they're for transportation
 
04:09:46.080 --> 04:09:47.830 align:start position:0%
they're not they're for transportation
only

04:09:47.830 --> 04:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:09:49.990 --> 04:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
there are those behind me who can speak
 
04:09:52.950 --> 04:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
from personal experience on the impacts
 
04:09:55.349 --> 04:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
of this clash
 
04:09:57.030 --> 04:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
as a freshman
 
04:09:59.269 --> 04:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
this was my first committee
 
04:10:01.349 --> 04:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
municipal and county
 
04:10:03.910 --> 04:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
if i learned nothing else i learned that
 
04:10:05.590 --> 04:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
a person's home
 
04:10:08.149 --> 04:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
really is their castle
 
04:10:10.550 --> 04:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
and as legislators that
 
04:10:14.870 --> 04:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
that should be where we stand
 
04:10:18.070 --> 04:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
looking back the legislature messed up
 
04:10:20.950 --> 04:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
the piecemeal expansion of ohrv use
 
04:10:24.149 --> 04:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
never involved to my knowledge the one
 
04:10:24.159 --> 04:10:25.429 align:start position:0%
never involved to my knowledge the one
committee

04:10:25.429 --> 04:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
one committee
 
04:10:30.469 --> 04:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
proficient in the knowledge in the in
 
04:10:33.030 --> 04:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
of the use of land
 
04:10:34.950 --> 04:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
things like zoning
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
powers of local government and
 
04:10:38.870 --> 04:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
government officials conflicting land
 
04:10:41.910 --> 04:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
use and yes abatements
 
04:10:45.910 --> 04:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:47.910 --> 04:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:10:51.030 --> 04:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
municipal and county needs to be part of
 
04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
i recall this scene in the movie die
 
04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
hard where bruce willis character
 
04:11:02.229 --> 04:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
in order to gain attention of the police
 
04:11:04.309 --> 04:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
car sent to investigate what was going
 
04:11:04.319 --> 04:11:05.269 align:start position:0%
car sent to investigate what was going
on

04:11:05.269 --> 04:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:11:08.550 --> 04:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
in the in the tower
 
04:11:11.429 --> 04:11:11.439 align:start position:0%
he eventually ends up throwing a body of
 
04:11:13.429 --> 04:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
the terrorists onto the hood of the
 
04:11:14.710 --> 04:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
police car
 
04:11:16.229 --> 04:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
and all of the machine guns of the
 
04:11:17.910 --> 04:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
terrorists open up
 
04:11:21.510 --> 04:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
and bruce willis says in the famous line
 
04:11:24.149 --> 04:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
welcome to the party pal
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
well welcome to the party
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%

04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
and county's
 
04:11:34.950 --> 04:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh expertise in this matter and i speak
 
04:11:39.910 --> 04:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:43.269 --> 04:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:46.389 --> 04:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:48.870 --> 04:11:48.880 align:start position:0%

town

04:13:01.030 --> 04:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:13:03.429 --> 04:13:03.439 align:start position:0%

road
 
04:13:07.269 --> 04:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh the town maintains it class six roads
 
04:13:10.070 --> 04:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
are not maintained by the town
 
04:13:12.870 --> 04:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh they're they
 
04:13:14.870 --> 04:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
they used to be called dirt roads and
 
04:13:14.880 --> 04:13:15.830 align:start position:0%
they used to be called dirt roads and
but

04:13:15.830 --> 04:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:13:17.910 --> 04:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh they are roads that is not maintained
 
04:13:19.510 --> 04:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
by the town but there are to people who
 
04:13:21.110 --> 04:13:21.120 align:start position:0%

uh and uh
they

04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:13:27.269 --> 04:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
in order to to fix those roads
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
they they need a permission of the town
 
04:13:32.389 --> 04:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
okay follow up mr chair yes okay thank
 
04:13:32.399 --> 04:13:33.110 align:start position:0%
okay follow up mr chair yes okay thank
you

04:13:33.110 --> 04:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
um so what about homes that are on maybe
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
a state road
 
04:13:40.149 --> 04:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
and maybe the town has allowed or the
 
04:13:42.550 --> 04:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
state has allowed ohrvs to travel on
 
04:13:44.469 --> 04:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
that road to get to
 
04:13:46.950 --> 04:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know to kind of as a connector to
 
04:13:49.189 --> 04:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
another ohrv trail
 
04:13:51.750 --> 04:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
um certainly those homeowners i would
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
think would be subjected to the same
 
04:13:57.750 --> 04:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
noise and dirt and particulate matter
 
04:13:59.990 --> 04:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
generated from ohrvs
 
04:14:02.149 --> 04:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
why are they not included in this bill
 
04:14:03.510 --> 04:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
04:14:05.750 --> 04:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
actually they should they've people have
 
04:14:09.110 --> 04:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
asked me to include it for uh
 
04:14:11.990 --> 04:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
to amend it yeah and i would not be uh
 
04:14:14.950 --> 04:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
adverse to that i i chose class five and
 
04:14:16.229 --> 04:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
class six
 
04:14:19.189 --> 04:14:19.199 align:start position:0%

i think thank you mr chan thank you for
 
04:14:31.030 --> 04:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
your your uh testimony i have in the uh
 
04:14:32.550 --> 04:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
act that says
 
04:14:35.269 --> 04:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
authority to obey prior year taxes and
 
04:14:38.870 --> 04:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not that familiar is why why that's
 
04:14:41.349 --> 04:14:41.359 align:start position:0%
even in the act is it just the way it's
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
written up by uh
 
04:14:46.870 --> 04:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
those who write up our our laws or what
 
04:14:49.349 --> 04:14:49.359 align:start position:0%
you got it that's that's that is the way
 
04:14:51.750 --> 04:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
it came from the uh
 
04:14:53.349 --> 04:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
that's the way they wrote it so there's
 
04:14:56.229 --> 04:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that uh allows
 
04:14:58.870 --> 04:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
abatement back for back years
 
04:15:00.870 --> 04:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh not to my knowledge that's not that's
 
04:15:02.710 --> 04:15:02.720 align:start position:0%

04:15:16.309 --> 04:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
noise ordinance uh that's going to the
 
04:15:18.870 --> 04:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
ballot and and of course that raises
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
questions about what's noise to me
 
04:15:22.149 --> 04:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
what's noise to you
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious
 
04:15:24.479 --> 04:15:25.910 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious
how

04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:15:29.510 --> 04:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
do you envision any kind of uh a process
 
04:15:32.389 --> 04:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
by which i'm going to be aggrieved
 
04:15:33.990 --> 04:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
is it noise
 
04:15:35.750 --> 04:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
is it volume
 
04:15:38.870 --> 04:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
or is that clearly left up to the board
 
04:15:41.269 --> 04:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
of selectmen
 
04:15:42.790 --> 04:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
well as
 
04:15:45.910 --> 04:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
the the noble noise the noise ordinances
 
04:15:45.920 --> 04:15:46.790 align:start position:0%
the the noble noise the noise ordinances
are

04:15:46.790 --> 04:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:15:49.510 --> 04:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh very difficult to enforce i think
 
04:15:53.189 --> 04:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
what you uh what you're going to
 
04:15:54.790 --> 04:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
really for
 
04:15:56.389 --> 04:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
abatement purposes
 
04:15:59.510 --> 04:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
it has to be the effect on the
 
04:16:01.750 --> 04:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
on the the homeowner
 
04:16:01.760 --> 04:16:02.950 align:start position:0%
on the the homeowner
uh

04:16:02.950 --> 04:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:16:04.630 --> 04:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
there's a there's obviously a big
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
04:16:06.720 --> 04:16:07.590 align:start position:0%
difference between
one

04:16:07.590 --> 04:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:16:10.149 --> 04:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
oh hrv going by
 
04:16:10.159 --> 04:16:11.269 align:start position:0%
oh hrv going by
and

04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:16:14.469 --> 04:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
100 or 200 and that's one of some of the
 
04:16:15.910 --> 04:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
issues that have
 
04:16:17.670 --> 04:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh driven this
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
but i think the way the way it is
 
04:16:21.269 --> 04:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
written it is a
 
04:16:23.830 --> 04:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh it is a uh
 
04:16:26.870 --> 04:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know a good is a cause of uh
 
04:16:30.550 --> 04:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
you know it is a something that is now
 
04:16:30.560 --> 04:16:31.590 align:start position:0%
you know it is a something that is now
uh

04:16:31.590 --> 04:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:16:33.189 --> 04:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
something that would be
 
04:16:36.550 --> 04:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
of an abate available for abatement now
 
04:16:40.630 --> 04:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
as opposed to it just being blown off
 
04:16:43.590 --> 04:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
04:16:45.189 --> 04:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
04:16:48.070 --> 04:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
04:16:49.830 --> 04:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
on the similar uh
 
04:16:49.840 --> 04:16:50.950 align:start position:0%
on the similar uh
line

04:16:50.950 --> 04:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:16:54.630 --> 04:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
noise and also emission has you know
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
have you considered emission pollution
 
04:16:59.349 --> 04:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
04:17:00.710 --> 04:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
the number eight
 
04:17:00.720 --> 04:17:01.750 align:start position:0%
the number eight
which

04:17:01.750 --> 04:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:17:04.710 --> 04:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
are we uh and the impact on the
 
04:17:07.990 --> 04:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
residential area see the
 
04:17:11.269 --> 04:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
the amount of dust and the amount of uh
 
04:17:11.279 --> 04:17:12.309 align:start position:0%
the amount of dust and the amount of uh
pollution

04:17:12.309 --> 04:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
pollution
 
04:17:15.910 --> 04:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh and the the actual impact of these
 
04:17:15.920 --> 04:17:17.110 align:start position:0%
uh and the the actual impact of these
vehicles

04:17:17.110 --> 04:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
04:17:19.189 --> 04:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
are pretty well known
 
04:17:20.950 --> 04:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
and the uh
 
04:17:20.960 --> 04:17:22.469 align:start position:0%
and the uh
so

04:17:22.469 --> 04:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:17:22.479 --> 04:17:23.429 align:start position:0%
so
they're

04:17:23.429 --> 04:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:17:27.269 --> 04:17:27.279 align:start position:0%
just stuff they're being available
 
04:17:28.790 --> 04:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
in an area
 
04:17:28.800 --> 04:17:29.190 align:start position:0%
in an area
and

04:17:29.190 --> 04:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:29.200 --> 04:17:30.469 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:17:31.750 --> 04:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
they're being
 
04:17:33.910 --> 04:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
the trails being used
 
04:17:35.349 --> 04:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh actually
 
04:17:39.349 --> 04:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
are it's pretty easy to determine what
 
04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
they will what they can and and can't do
 
04:17:43.199 --> 04:17:44.630 align:start position:0%
they will what they can and and can't do
uh

04:17:44.630 --> 04:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:17:46.870 --> 04:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
as far as the environment
 
04:17:46.880 --> 04:17:47.750 align:start position:0%
as far as the environment
uh

04:17:47.750 --> 04:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:17:47.760 --> 04:17:48.790 align:start position:0%
uh
we're

04:17:48.790 --> 04:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:17:51.590 --> 04:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
we're taught with like the folks behind
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh maybe we'll be able to speak better
 
04:17:57.510 --> 04:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
to that as to what the impacts actually
 
04:17:59.910 --> 04:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
how they how it affects
 
04:18:03.670 --> 04:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:07.990 --> 04:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:10.070 --> 04:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
04:18:10.080 --> 04:18:12.229 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
question

04:18:12.229 --> 04:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:18:15.269 --> 04:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
i live on route 3a
 
04:18:16.950 --> 04:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
in litchfield
 
04:18:19.830 --> 04:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
which i have to live fairly close to the
 
04:18:19.840 --> 04:18:20.710 align:start position:0%
which i have to live fairly close to the
road

04:18:20.710 --> 04:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
road
 
04:18:23.110 --> 04:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
there are no
 
04:18:26.630 --> 04:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
atvs that go in front of my house
 
04:18:28.630 --> 04:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
what i do have
 
04:18:32.790 --> 04:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
is a lot of motorcycles go up and down
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
route 3a
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
because it's a very scenic road
 
04:18:37.520 --> 04:18:39.429 align:start position:0%
because it's a very scenic road
and

04:18:39.429 --> 04:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:39.439 --> 04:18:40.710 align:start position:0%
and
the

04:18:40.710 --> 04:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:43.110 --> 04:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's not a toll road or anything like
 
04:18:43.120 --> 04:18:43.990 align:start position:0%
it's not a toll road or anything like
that

04:18:43.990 --> 04:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:18:47.510 --> 04:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
now the motorcycles really produce a lot
 
04:18:50.149 --> 04:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
of noise a lot of noise
 
04:18:51.590 --> 04:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
i also
 
04:18:53.110 --> 04:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
am a writer
 
04:18:55.750 --> 04:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
of a side-by-side atv
 
04:18:58.630 --> 04:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's one of the most pleasurable things
 
04:18:59.830 --> 04:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
that i have
 
04:18:59.840 --> 04:19:00.630 align:start position:0%
that i have
left

04:19:00.630 --> 04:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
left
 
04:19:04.790 --> 04:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
in in the world i have hand controls on
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
it so i don't need to use my legs
 
04:19:07.680 --> 04:19:08.950 align:start position:0%
it so i don't need to use my legs
now

04:19:08.950 --> 04:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:19:12.149 --> 04:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
we have a place in coast county where i
 
04:19:13.670 --> 04:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
ride this
 
04:19:13.680 --> 04:19:15.189 align:start position:0%
ride this
now

04:19:15.189 --> 04:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:19:18.870 --> 04:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of atvs up there because
 
04:19:21.990 --> 04:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
we live right on the trail
 
04:19:24.870 --> 04:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
but the noise that is produced by the
 
04:19:24.880 --> 04:19:26.309 align:start position:0%
but the noise that is produced by the
atv

04:19:26.309 --> 04:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
atv
 
04:19:28.229 --> 04:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
is much less
 
04:19:31.110 --> 04:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
than the noise produced by
 
04:19:33.510 --> 04:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
motorcycles particularly harley-davidson
 
04:19:33.520 --> 04:19:35.110 align:start position:0%
motorcycles particularly harley-davidson
motorcycles

04:19:35.110 --> 04:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
motorcycles
 
04:19:37.189 --> 04:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
now my question of you
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
is for assessors and selectmen
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
who are
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
trying to quantify
 
04:19:47.349 --> 04:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
some sort of abatement
 
04:19:49.510 --> 04:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
how would they how would they go about
 
04:19:54.229 --> 04:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
i think the very fact that
 
04:19:57.680 --> 04:19:58.790 align:start position:0%
i think the very fact that
a

04:19:58.790 --> 04:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:20:01.590 --> 04:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
high impact
 
04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
area a high impact
 
04:20:06.389 --> 04:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
recreational use
 
04:20:08.790 --> 04:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
and that's what
 
04:20:11.670 --> 04:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
these these vehicles in especially in
 
04:20:11.680 --> 04:20:13.189 align:start position:0%
these these vehicles in especially in
mass

04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
mass
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
consist of
 
04:20:17.590 --> 04:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:20:17.600 --> 04:20:18.710 align:start position:0%
i mean
they

04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:20:21.349 --> 04:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
by the very fact and what they what is
 
04:20:23.750 --> 04:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
known to produce
 
04:20:27.189 --> 04:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
will was is should be sufficient
 
04:20:30.630 --> 04:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
now in your case you're on a trail
 
04:20:33.189 --> 04:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
you're not on a class six road or a
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
class five road
 
04:20:36.469 --> 04:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
it's much different there's much
 
04:20:37.750 --> 04:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
difference especially if you're on a
 
04:20:40.950 --> 04:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
class six road which in
 
04:20:43.750 --> 04:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
in effect is a very
 
04:20:45.510 --> 04:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
fragile road
 
04:20:45.520 --> 04:20:47.670 align:start position:0%
fragile road
and

04:20:47.670 --> 04:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:50.309 --> 04:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
most of the homes uh on it are fairly
 
04:20:52.149 --> 04:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
close to it
 
04:20:55.269 --> 04:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
so it's they are
 
04:20:55.279 --> 04:20:56.149 align:start position:0%
so it's they are
the

04:20:56.149 --> 04:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:58.630 --> 04:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
a bunch of this is
 
04:21:00.790 --> 04:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
situational but
 
04:21:02.469 --> 04:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
i think by the
 
04:21:06.070 --> 04:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:07.750 --> 04:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
ability this
 
04:21:10.149 --> 04:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
area that your area where your home is
 
04:21:13.910 --> 04:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
has been determined to allow these
 
04:21:15.590 --> 04:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
which they're this
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
heavy impact use
 
04:21:20.790 --> 04:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
it should be sufficient
 
04:21:23.510 --> 04:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
to warrant an abatement
 
04:21:26.229 --> 04:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh i know you you live on route 3a
 
04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
that's that is a probably a class
 
04:21:32.389 --> 04:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
probably a class two or three because it
 
04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
says a secondary yeah it's a secondary
 
04:21:37.110 --> 04:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
state road that's made for heavy heavy
 
04:21:37.120 --> 04:21:38.469 align:start position:0%
state road that's made for heavy heavy
vehicles

04:21:38.469 --> 04:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
04:21:43.990 --> 04:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:44.000 --> 04:21:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:21:45.030 --> 04:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:47.590 --> 04:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
that that is not covered by by this of
 
04:21:47.600 --> 04:21:48.830 align:start position:0%
that that is not covered by by this of
course

04:21:48.830 --> 04:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
course
 
04:21:56.389 --> 04:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:58.469 --> 04:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
did you i'm sorry mr chairman i didn't
 
04:22:01.670 --> 04:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
hear you uh thank you again for being
 
04:22:03.110 --> 04:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
here and
 
04:22:04.870 --> 04:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
i can imagine you you almost feel like
 
04:22:06.149 --> 04:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
you're sitting in front of a bunch of
 
04:22:06.159 --> 04:22:07.990 align:start position:0%
you're sitting in front of a bunch of
selectmen

04:22:07.990 --> 04:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
04:22:10.389 --> 04:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
but you are i happen to be
 
04:22:11.910 --> 04:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me
 
04:22:14.389 --> 04:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
would you believe not what you believe
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a fact that when they value
 
04:22:17.520 --> 04:22:18.630 align:start position:0%
it's not a fact that when they value
homes

04:22:18.630 --> 04:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
homes
 
04:22:20.229 --> 04:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
that they take a lot of things into
 
04:22:22.870 --> 04:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
consideration and the value of those
 
04:22:24.790 --> 04:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
homes in the area that you're talking
 
04:22:28.070 --> 04:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
about would be impacted by the situation
 
04:22:31.110 --> 04:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
you talk you're talking about they have
 
04:22:31.120 --> 04:22:32.469 align:start position:0%
you talk you're talking about they have
saleable

04:22:32.469 --> 04:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
saleable
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
value would be impacted
 
04:22:37.349 --> 04:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
i would suggest to you that
 
04:22:38.790 --> 04:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh wouldn't you
 
04:22:41.510 --> 04:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
think this would be better uh taken care
 
04:22:42.790 --> 04:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
of in
 
04:22:45.670 --> 04:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
assessing the value of the house
 
04:22:48.630 --> 04:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
as assessed instead of trying to go into
 
04:22:54.309 --> 04:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:56.710 --> 04:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
i don't quite understand in the uh
 
04:22:58.870 --> 04:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry uh maybe i better put it
 
04:23:00.870 --> 04:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
clearer isn't it better to leave the
 
04:23:03.910 --> 04:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
value of the house that's impacted by
 
04:23:05.429 --> 04:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
this condition
 
04:23:07.510 --> 04:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
determine what the
 
04:23:07.520 --> 04:23:08.710 align:start position:0%
determine what the
uh

04:23:08.710 --> 04:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
tax will be instead of going into the
 
04:23:13.990 --> 04:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
back door and after the fact putting a
 
04:23:17.349 --> 04:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
an abatement on that same property who
 
04:23:19.670 --> 04:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
has been valued and taken into
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
consideration the plus and minuses of
 
04:23:24.229 --> 04:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood well
 
04:23:26.630 --> 04:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
most of the time aren't the evaluations
 
04:23:26.640 --> 04:23:27.349 align:start position:0%
most of the time aren't the evaluations
of

04:23:27.349 --> 04:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:23:29.189 --> 04:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
of properties
 
04:23:29.199 --> 04:23:31.750 align:start position:0%
of properties
made

04:23:31.750 --> 04:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:39.030 --> 04:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
by the assessing authority
 
04:23:39.040 --> 04:23:40.149 align:start position:0%
by the assessing authority
and

04:23:40.149 --> 04:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:23:43.590 --> 04:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
if they don't dig into the uh
 
04:23:45.990 --> 04:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
that much into the
 
04:23:49.269 --> 04:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh the sighting of of the of the houses
 
04:23:50.950 --> 04:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
usually they'll just go by
 
04:23:53.510 --> 04:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
comparative values things of that nature
 
04:23:57.110 --> 04:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
so i i don't think they that
 
04:24:01.030 --> 04:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
on our uh just just using the assessment
 
04:24:01.040 --> 04:24:02.070 align:start position:0%
on our uh just just using the assessment
alone

04:24:02.070 --> 04:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
alone
 
04:24:05.110 --> 04:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
is uh would be sufficient for to to make
 
04:24:07.030 --> 04:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
restitution all right thank you thank
 
04:24:08.870 --> 04:24:08.880 align:start position:0%

as you folks are aware passage of this
 
04:25:18.389 --> 04:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
bill will create an opportunity
 
04:25:20.710 --> 04:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
for a fair and just property tax
 
04:25:23.189 --> 04:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
abatement for affected properties when
 
04:25:24.630 --> 04:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
the government
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
allows town roads or highways
 
04:25:30.630 --> 04:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
to be used as trails by off-highway
 
04:25:32.710 --> 04:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
recreational vehicles
 
04:25:34.710 --> 04:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment makes such an
 
04:25:34.720 --> 04:25:35.750 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment makes such an
allowance

04:25:35.750 --> 04:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
allowance
 
04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
to be good cause
 
04:25:40.590 --> 04:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
for a property tax abatement under rsa
 
04:25:40.600 --> 04:25:42.550 align:start position:0%
for a property tax abatement under rsa

7616
 
04:25:44.479 --> 04:25:45.670 align:start position:0%
7616
already

04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:25:45.680 --> 04:25:47.349 align:start position:0%
already
allows

04:25:47.349 --> 04:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
allows
 
04:25:49.510 --> 04:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
for consideration of back taxes that's
 
04:25:51.510 --> 04:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
already in the statute
 
04:25:53.670 --> 04:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
gives that option to selectmen
 
04:25:56.469 --> 04:25:56.479 align:start position:0%
this bill would not affect that wording
 
04:26:00.550 --> 04:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
of rsa 7616. all this bill does is add a
 
04:26:03.670 --> 04:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
under the good causes allowed
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that the selectmen and the
 
04:26:07.910 --> 04:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
state have designated
 
04:26:14.229 --> 04:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
when town roads become ohrv trails
 
04:26:20.790 --> 04:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
they become a detrimental nuisance in
 
04:26:22.229 --> 04:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
the vicinity of residential
 
04:26:22.239 --> 04:26:23.269 align:start position:0%
the vicinity of residential
neighborhoods

04:26:23.269 --> 04:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods
 
04:26:23.279 --> 04:26:24.070 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods
and

04:26:24.070 --> 04:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:24.080 --> 04:26:26.229 align:start position:0%
and
and

04:26:26.229 --> 04:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:28.710 --> 04:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
other properties in the town
 
04:26:31.110 --> 04:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
i recognize that motorcycles are noisy
 
04:26:34.149 --> 04:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
as well but motorcycles are subject to a
 
04:26:35.830 --> 04:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
noise ordinance believe it or not there
 
04:26:39.189 --> 04:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
is a limit to how loud a motorcycle can
 
04:26:41.670 --> 04:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
legally be in the state of new hampshire
 
04:26:44.229 --> 04:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
law enforcement doesn't enforce it
 
04:26:46.389 --> 04:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
because they have to buy
 
04:26:46.399 --> 04:26:48.229 align:start position:0%
because they have to buy
sound

04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
sound
 
04:26:50.550 --> 04:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
measuring devices and it's expensive for
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
towns to acquire those things and so a
 
04:26:56.830 --> 04:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
law officer may hear one go by that is
 
04:26:59.590 --> 04:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
offensive but it doesn't have the tools
 
04:27:04.389 --> 04:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:06.229 --> 04:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
i have served as a state representative
 
04:27:07.349 --> 04:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
in recent
 
04:27:10.550 --> 04:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
years past and it's good to be back
 
04:27:12.790 --> 04:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
among you and grateful for your
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
volunteering service here
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
but while i served up until 2020 i
 
04:27:20.630 --> 04:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
received a great many phone calls and
 
04:27:23.510 --> 04:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
letters from constituents
 
04:27:25.269 --> 04:27:25.279 align:start position:0%

and they will complain if you seek to

impose a muffler because if you put a

muffler on one of these engines
 
04:29:15.110 --> 04:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
supposedly they can't carry as many

people these me these machines have
 
04:29:19.830 --> 04:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
become huge they carry four people at a

you see young people that used to use

and look like so much fun i'm sure the
 
04:29:35.110 --> 04:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
big ones are fun also but they're not
 
04:29:37.349 --> 04:29:37.359 align:start position:0%

04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%

it is a medical fact
 
04:30:02.229 --> 04:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
that hearing loss is possible from
 
04:30:04.469 --> 04:30:04.479 align:start position:0%

jake breaking for large trucks
 
04:30:15.510 --> 04:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
because they want to keep the noise down
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
allow unmuffled ohrvs on the city

declare these roads to be

04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
please consider that it's the current
 
04:31:12.550 --> 04:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
taxation policy of new hampshire that
 
04:31:15.429 --> 04:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
the value of a property with a pleasant
 
04:31:15.439 --> 04:31:16.870 align:start position:0%
the value of a property with a pleasant
view

04:31:16.870 --> 04:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
view
 
04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
can be taxed at a higher value than a
 
04:31:22.950 --> 04:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
similar property without such a view
 
04:31:25.510 --> 04:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
as a result the tax liability on such a
 
04:31:29.110 --> 04:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
property is higher due to that special
 
04:31:31.189 --> 04:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
positive circumstance sometimes called
 
04:31:33.349 --> 04:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
the view tax
 
04:31:35.590 --> 04:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't it follow that a special
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
negative circumstance should allow a
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
lower tax liability
 
04:31:42.389 --> 04:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
properties impacted by having the
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
adjacent roadways become ohiv trails are
 
04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
burdened by an unwelcome nuisance
 
04:31:50.149 --> 04:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
rather than benefiting from something
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
like a valuable view
 
04:31:55.189 --> 04:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
given the noise dirt dust fumes and
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
other detriments generated by proximity
 
04:32:00.229 --> 04:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
to such trails on town roads
 
04:32:02.389 --> 04:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
it is simply fair and just to recognize
 
04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
the burden and loss of value
 
04:32:08.630 --> 04:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
as house bill 1289 proposes
 
04:32:10.389 --> 04:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
such an effective property should be
 
04:32:12.630 --> 04:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
eligible for an abatement
 
04:32:14.389 --> 04:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
for good cause
 
04:32:16.229 --> 04:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
and then allowed to be taxed at a lower
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
amount due to special circumstances
 
04:32:21.269 --> 04:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
if the other requirements of the law are
 
04:32:21.279 --> 04:32:23.510 align:start position:0%
if the other requirements of the law are
met

04:32:23.510 --> 04:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
met
 
04:32:25.750 --> 04:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
by way of anecdote i have spoken with at
 
04:32:27.990 --> 04:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
least one citizen in the north country
 
04:32:29.590 --> 04:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
who's been informed
 
04:32:32.149 --> 04:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
that his taxes are higher than others in
 
04:32:33.269 --> 04:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
his area
 
04:32:36.870 --> 04:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
because of the value added
 
04:32:39.269 --> 04:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
for the truly pleasant view from his
 
04:32:39.279 --> 04:32:40.469 align:start position:0%
for the truly pleasant view from his
home

04:32:40.469 --> 04:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
home
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
however now
 
04:32:45.269 --> 04:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
all summer long he suffers daily waves
 
04:32:47.670 --> 04:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
of ohrvs
 
04:32:51.750 --> 04:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
documented at over 780 document ohrvs in
 
04:32:53.349 --> 04:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
a day
 
04:32:55.990 --> 04:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
divide that by eight hours and that's
 
04:33:00.950 --> 04:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:03.110 --> 04:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
some days they're in the hundreds
 
04:33:05.349 --> 04:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
traveling on the pond side road where he
 
04:33:05.359 --> 04:33:06.789 align:start position:0%
traveling on the pond side road where he
lives

04:33:06.789 --> 04:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
lives
 
04:33:08.949 --> 04:33:08.959 align:start position:0%
the circumstance this circumstance was
 
04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
created because the town selectmen in
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire bureau of trails have
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
made that road into an ohrv trail
 
04:33:17.990 --> 04:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
the property owner was informed that
 
04:33:19.269 --> 04:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
while he
 
04:33:21.990 --> 04:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
pays extra for the view he may get no
 
04:33:24.390 --> 04:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
abatement for the noise dirt dust and
 
04:33:26.789 --> 04:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
disruption caused
 
04:33:30.629 --> 04:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
by the road becoming a trail
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
so because of the impact on the quiet
 
04:33:35.590 --> 04:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
enjoyment and value of these citizens
 
04:33:35.600 --> 04:33:36.551 align:start position:0%
enjoyment and value of these citizens
property

04:33:36.551 --> 04:33:36.561 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:33:39.189 --> 04:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
caused by the public policy that permits
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
these roads to become trails it has only
 
04:33:43.429 --> 04:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
failed to afford the property owner on
 
04:33:46.070 --> 04:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
such roads the opportunity to petition
 
04:33:47.830 --> 04:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
for a tax abatement
 
04:33:49.590 --> 04:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
with good cause
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
i hope you'll give this
 
04:33:52.320 --> 04:33:53.269 align:start position:0%
i hope you'll give this
idea

04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
idea
 
04:33:55.830 --> 04:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
a positive hearing and send it to the
 
04:33:58.230 --> 04:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
floor of the house for a positive vote
 
04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
it will
 
04:34:01.109 --> 04:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
be well received by the people who
 
04:34:03.189 --> 04:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
suffer from these circumstances thank
 
04:34:05.029 --> 04:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
04:34:07.349 --> 04:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
04:34:09.109 --> 04:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
so you're seeking
 
04:34:11.429 --> 04:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
the ability to apply for an abatement
 
04:34:13.830 --> 04:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
which will lower the taxes for the
 
04:34:17.109 --> 04:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:17.119 --> 04:34:18.869 align:start position:0%
 
what

04:34:18.869 --> 04:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
what benefit does the
 
04:34:23.510 --> 04:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
that property owner that's dealing with
 
04:34:25.029 --> 04:34:25.039 align:start position:0%
the noise
 
04:34:28.869 --> 04:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
and the dust and so forth yet
 
04:34:33.189 --> 04:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:35.429 --> 04:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
unless the legislatures
 
04:34:35.439 --> 04:34:36.470 align:start position:0%
unless the legislatures
douse

04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
douse
 
04:34:36.480 --> 04:34:37.990 align:start position:0%
douse
selectmen

04:34:37.990 --> 04:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
04:34:38.000 --> 04:34:39.670 align:start position:0%
selectmen
and

04:34:39.670 --> 04:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
the bureau trails that they can't make
 
04:34:44.949 --> 04:34:44.959 align:start position:0%
class five and six roads into trails the
 
04:34:47.029 --> 04:34:47.039 align:start position:0%
property would get no other relief the
 
04:34:49.349 --> 04:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
other than a bit of compensation
 
04:34:51.990 --> 04:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
for the harm they suffer as a result of
 
04:34:53.429 --> 04:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
having this nuisance created by
 
04:34:53.439 --> 04:34:55.029 align:start position:0%
having this nuisance created by
government

04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:34:57.429 --> 04:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
for whatever reasons the government may
 
04:34:59.750 --> 04:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
seem and you believe that that
 
04:35:02.789 --> 04:35:02.799 align:start position:0%
benefit of the abatement will
 
04:35:04.709 --> 04:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
make the make these
 
04:35:07.349 --> 04:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
affected citizens happy
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
i believe it will make them happier sir
 
04:35:11.510 --> 04:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
it won't make them happy
 
04:35:13.109 --> 04:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:35:15.429 --> 04:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you uh
 
04:35:17.510 --> 04:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
honorable my hand for being here thank
 
04:35:18.869 --> 04:35:18.879 align:start position:0%
you um
 
04:35:22.629 --> 04:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
i was up in that area and i observed a
 
04:35:25.429 --> 04:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
lot of the ohrv activity in front of
 
04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
homes and and on on city streets
 
04:35:30.629 --> 04:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
and i was appalled by what people have
 
04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
to tolerate
 
04:35:34.949 --> 04:35:34.959 align:start position:0%
but my question is uh have they not had
 
04:35:37.830 --> 04:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
access to any abatement before this is
 
04:35:37.840 --> 04:35:40.390 align:start position:0%
access to any abatement before this is
this

04:35:40.390 --> 04:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:42.390 --> 04:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
i believe i understand your question i
 
04:35:44.551 --> 04:35:44.561 align:start position:0%
believe and the answer is
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
i i believe under 76 16 any citizen can
 
04:35:48.629 --> 04:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
file an abatement petition with a
 
04:35:51.029 --> 04:35:51.039 align:start position:0%
selectmen the issue and the and the
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
benefit that this statute as i
 
04:35:54.789 --> 04:35:54.799 align:start position:0%
understand it will offer is that it
 
04:35:54.799 --> 04:35:56.310 align:start position:0%
understand it will offer is that it
gives

04:35:56.310 --> 04:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
gives
 
04:35:58.070 --> 04:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
a presumption
 
04:36:01.269 --> 04:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
that the petition is got good cause
 
04:36:03.109 --> 04:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
so the citizen
 
04:36:05.349 --> 04:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
may still have to persuade the selectmen
 
04:36:07.189 --> 04:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
of how much the damage is the swap and
 
04:36:08.629 --> 04:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
still have all the discretion they have
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
with regard to any other abatement this
 
04:36:12.869 --> 04:36:12.879 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect the slayman's power
 
04:36:15.109 --> 04:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
it just prevents them the from it
 
04:36:17.590 --> 04:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
prevents the citizen from being told
 
04:36:20.070 --> 04:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
that you know ohrvs are not a reason for
 
04:36:21.910 --> 04:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
an abatement go away
 
04:36:24.629 --> 04:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
it gives them the right to say oh all
 
04:36:26.629 --> 04:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
right you've got good cause we have to
 
04:36:27.910 --> 04:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
consider it
 
04:36:29.590 --> 04:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding of the law and
 
04:36:31.189 --> 04:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
its impact
 
04:36:35.109 --> 04:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:36.551 --> 04:36:36.561 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:36:39.029 --> 04:36:39.039 align:start position:0%
honorable for taking my question
 
04:36:41.349 --> 04:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
my question pertains to the process by
 
04:36:44.070 --> 04:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
which a municipality
 
04:36:47.830 --> 04:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
allows a road such as a classics road to
 
04:36:49.590 --> 04:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
be used for
 
04:36:51.750 --> 04:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
such recreational purposes is there a
 
04:36:54.150 --> 04:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
hearing is there opportunity for our bud
 
04:36:57.029 --> 04:36:57.039 align:start position:0%
is to come in to provide import and
 
04:36:59.189 --> 04:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
could you explain that process to me
 
04:37:03.429 --> 04:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll explain it as best i can
 
04:37:05.109 --> 04:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's a sore point in the
 
04:37:08.869 --> 04:37:08.879 align:start position:0%
sense most of the coast county
 
04:37:17.269 --> 04:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:20.789 --> 04:37:20.799 align:start position:0%
i was going to say even early in 2013
 
04:37:21.850 --> 04:37:21.860 align:start position:0%
and it was done
 
04:37:21.860 --> 04:37:23.830 align:start position:0%
and it was done
[Music]

04:37:23.830 --> 04:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
in my own town
 
04:37:26.709 --> 04:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
the bureau of trails called the
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
selectmen on a monday night
 
04:37:29.279 --> 04:37:30.230 align:start position:0%
selectmen on a monday night
because

04:37:30.230 --> 04:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:37:32.470 --> 04:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
and said do you are you okay with our
 
04:37:35.590 --> 04:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
making your roads into trails and the
 
04:37:37.429 --> 04:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
selectmen two of them were present that
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
monday night and they said sure go ahead
 
04:37:41.510 --> 04:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
there was no public hearing there was no
 
04:37:44.789 --> 04:37:44.799 align:start position:0%
notice to the property owners
 
04:37:47.349 --> 04:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
until the signs started going up
 
04:37:48.869 --> 04:37:48.879 align:start position:0%
that it's now a part of the ride the
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
wilds trail
 
04:37:51.910 --> 04:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
the right wiles trail
 
04:37:54.150 --> 04:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
advertises a thousand miles of ohrv
 
04:37:57.670 --> 04:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
trails of which to the best i can get
 
04:37:59.349 --> 04:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
for information at least three or four
 
04:38:01.349 --> 04:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
hundred of those miles are public ways
 
04:38:02.310 --> 04:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
04:38:04.869 --> 04:38:04.879 align:start position:0%
trails in the woods where the noise and
 
04:38:04.879 --> 04:38:05.750 align:start position:0%
trails in the woods where the noise and
the

04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:38:07.510 --> 04:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
dirt and the congestion
 
04:38:08.830 --> 04:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
and the fun
 
04:38:11.349 --> 04:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
um will be found
 
04:38:12.949 --> 04:38:12.959 align:start position:0%
it's public ways
 
04:38:15.109 --> 04:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
so there there is an effort and has been
 
04:38:17.670 --> 04:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
an effort in prior years recent years to
 
04:38:19.830 --> 04:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
get notice and require notice and there
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
may in fact be the case where selectmen
 
04:38:24.390 --> 04:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
now must give notice
 
04:38:26.629 --> 04:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
of a hearing before they
 
04:38:26.639 --> 04:38:27.670 align:start position:0%
of a hearing before they
allow

04:38:27.670 --> 04:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
allow
 
04:38:30.310 --> 04:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
such a use representative guthrie
 
04:38:32.070 --> 04:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:38:35.349 --> 04:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
your testimony your honourable
 
04:38:37.510 --> 04:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
former house
 
04:38:40.949 --> 04:38:40.959 align:start position:0%
uh we miss you i'm quite sure uh
 
04:38:43.029 --> 04:38:43.039 align:start position:0%
is it your contention that
 
04:38:45.429 --> 04:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
the assessing cannot take into
 
04:38:48.310 --> 04:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
consideration the conditions that you're
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
talking about because there's no
 
04:38:51.990 --> 04:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
question that there
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know how you contend with it and
 
04:38:56.709 --> 04:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
i'm a selectman in hampstead and we
 
04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
don't have it and i'm glad we don't have
 
04:39:01.109 --> 04:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
it because if this bill passed the
 
04:39:03.510 --> 04:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences is that they're
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
going to get about 200 requests for an
 
04:39:09.109 --> 04:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
abatement so again to get back to my
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
question is it your contention that the
 
04:39:11.279 --> 04:39:12.551 align:start position:0%
question is it your contention that the
assessors

04:39:12.551 --> 04:39:12.561 align:start position:0%
assessors
 
04:39:15.029 --> 04:39:15.039 align:start position:0%
cannot take this into consideration when
 
04:39:16.629 --> 04:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
they're determining the value of the
 
04:39:16.639 --> 04:39:18.869 align:start position:0%
they're determining the value of the
homes

04:39:18.869 --> 04:39:18.879 align:start position:0%
homes
 
04:39:22.629 --> 04:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
this has been a a situation since 2013
 
04:39:26.789 --> 04:39:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:29.029 --> 04:39:29.039 align:start position:0%
while when they assess
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
property for views they actually make a
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
point of putting in the assessment that
 
04:39:36.789 --> 04:39:36.799 align:start position:0%
so much may be related to the view
 
04:39:39.590 --> 04:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
there's no history of them taking into
 
04:39:41.990 --> 04:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
consideration the negative consequences
 
04:39:43.990 --> 04:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
of trails and noise and things of that
 
04:39:44.000 --> 04:39:45.830 align:start position:0%
of trails and noise and things of that
nature

04:39:45.830 --> 04:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
nature
 
04:39:47.190 --> 04:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
i expect
 
04:39:49.590 --> 04:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
a sincere assessor
 
04:39:49.600 --> 04:39:51.350 align:start position:0%
a sincere assessor
would

04:39:51.350 --> 04:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:39:53.030 --> 04:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
but he'd have to sit out there on a
 
04:39:56.708 --> 04:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
saturday and count the 780 ohrbs going
 
04:39:59.030 --> 04:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
by listen to him to somehow make a
 
04:39:59.040 --> 04:40:00.788 align:start position:0%
by listen to him to somehow make a
subjective

04:40:00.788 --> 04:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
04:40:02.550 --> 04:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
assessment as to what that
 
04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
value is
 
04:40:04.080 --> 04:40:04.948 align:start position:0%
value is
um

04:40:04.948 --> 04:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
i had thought that it would be good for
 
04:40:07.200 --> 04:40:08.708 align:start position:0%
i had thought that it would be good for
this

04:40:08.708 --> 04:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:40:11.670 --> 04:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
statute to say the abatement would be
 
04:40:14.868 --> 04:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
250 dollars off credit against your tax
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
some firm amount but it doesn't say that
 
04:40:20.150 --> 04:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
it leaves it up to the judgment of the
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
selectmen to use their judgment along
 
04:40:25.830 --> 04:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
with their town assessor if necessary to
 
04:40:27.750 --> 04:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
come up with a value
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
um so i think the value still
 
04:40:32.150 --> 04:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
enters in
 
04:40:32.160 --> 04:40:33.830 align:start position:0%
enters in
because

04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:40:35.590 --> 04:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
once the petition for good cause is
 
04:40:39.110 --> 04:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
presented it still becomes quite
 
04:40:42.150 --> 04:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
quite judgmental or on the part of the
 
04:40:44.070 --> 04:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
selectmen as to what they want to do we
 
04:40:46.070 --> 04:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
have my deepest sympathy
 
04:40:47.670 --> 04:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
and through all those
 
04:40:49.750 --> 04:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
people and i'm sorry
 
04:40:53.350 --> 04:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
but they have to contend with this well
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing it forward and
 
04:40:56.150 --> 04:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
we're great that's why we're grateful to
 
04:40:57.750 --> 04:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative renzolo and others who
 
04:40:59.670 --> 04:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
have carried on the
 
04:41:02.230 --> 04:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
effort to address the issue thank you mr
 
04:41:03.670 --> 04:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you
 
04:41:05.910 --> 04:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative manchuri
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
04:41:10.708 --> 04:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:41:12.550 --> 04:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
i try to look at each bill as an
 
04:41:14.310 --> 04:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
individual bill but we can't do that we
 
04:41:16.070 --> 04:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
have to we can't just do that we have to
 
04:41:17.910 --> 04:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
look at it in its totality we have two
 
04:41:19.990 --> 04:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
other bills that we heard today
 
04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
both consider
 
04:41:24.390 --> 04:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh abatement of nuisances that interfere
 
04:41:27.590 --> 04:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
with the enjoyment of property
 
04:41:31.510 --> 04:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
that give cause for unsanitary living
 
04:41:31.520 --> 04:41:32.868 align:start position:0%
that give cause for unsanitary living
conditions

04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
04:41:34.868 --> 04:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
those are two different bills
 
04:41:37.750 --> 04:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
that give towns cities health inspectors
 
04:41:40.150 --> 04:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
the right to look at things as they
 
04:41:42.628 --> 04:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
affect your personal property
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
so i look at your bill and wonder
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
could you see where the board of
 
04:41:49.510 --> 04:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
selectmen would say i reject your good
 
04:41:49.520 --> 04:41:50.868 align:start position:0%
selectmen would say i reject your good
cause

04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
cause
 
04:41:52.948 --> 04:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
and take it a step further i'm not going
 
04:41:55.110 --> 04:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
to abate your taxes
 
04:41:57.430 --> 04:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
but instead i'm going to close that road
 
04:42:00.230 --> 04:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
would i have a problem there if all
 
04:42:02.788 --> 04:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
three of these bills passed because i'm
 
04:42:05.350 --> 04:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
making a judgment on what i what we are
 
04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
considering to be a nuisance
 
04:42:10.390 --> 04:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
and unsanitary conditions
 
04:42:12.628 --> 04:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
and have three separate at least three
 
04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
separate instances where i can make that
 
04:42:16.550 --> 04:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
judgment and i'm wondering if i'm going
 
04:42:18.230 --> 04:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
to have a problem my question is am i
 
04:42:20.788 --> 04:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
going to have a problem if i deny your
 
04:42:22.708 --> 04:42:22.718 align:start position:0%
abatement on a judgment for what a
 
04:42:23.990 --> 04:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
nuisance is
 
04:42:27.670 --> 04:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:29.030 --> 04:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
i say all the time i'm not even sure
 
04:42:31.350 --> 04:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
that my question made sense
 
04:42:35.670 --> 04:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
i i do i believe i understand
 
04:42:37.270 --> 04:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
how much
 
04:42:40.070 --> 04:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
the existing tax code
 
04:42:42.070 --> 04:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
and maybe recommendations for other
 
04:42:43.670 --> 04:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
changes to the code
 
04:42:46.070 --> 04:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
put a burden on selectmen and city
 
04:42:48.230 --> 04:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
assessors and people have to make those
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:54.550 --> 04:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
one of the differences that i see here
 
04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
from what i understand your question to
 
04:42:59.670 --> 04:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
address is that the property owner
 
04:43:01.990 --> 04:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
who puts in a olympic-sized swimming
 
04:43:04.948 --> 04:43:04.958 align:start position:0%
pool is personally doing something
 
04:43:06.628 --> 04:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
that ends up increasing the value of his
 
04:43:06.638 --> 04:43:08.150 align:start position:0%
that ends up increasing the value of his
property

04:43:08.150 --> 04:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:43:10.788 --> 04:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
if you buy a house with a spectacular
 
04:43:12.628 --> 04:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
view that increases the value of your
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
property that's something you've chosen
 
04:43:16.628 --> 04:43:16.638 align:start position:0%
and you've done
 
04:43:19.350 --> 04:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
if you let your property go to
 
04:43:19.360 --> 04:43:21.030 align:start position:0%
if you let your property go to
hell

04:43:21.030 --> 04:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
hell
 
04:43:23.430 --> 04:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
and and if that's what the nuisance or
 
04:43:26.310 --> 04:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
bad condition issue is i mean that's
 
04:43:27.750 --> 04:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
something that's being personally done
 
04:43:29.830 --> 04:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
by a land owner and it should be dealt
 
04:43:31.030 --> 04:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
with somewhat
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
differently than this
 
04:43:34.390 --> 04:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
this is an abatement as a result of
 
04:43:36.150 --> 04:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
action that government took
 
04:43:38.390 --> 04:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
the government made this
 
04:43:40.948 --> 04:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
from a standard road which has noisy
 
04:43:43.110 --> 04:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles that go by already but when it
 
04:43:44.788 --> 04:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
adds hundreds
 
04:43:46.868 --> 04:43:46.878 align:start position:0%
of unmuffled
 
04:43:49.270 --> 04:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles designed both from a safety
 
04:43:51.510 --> 04:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
perspective and every other perspective
 
04:43:55.270 --> 04:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
to not be on town on pavement these
 
04:43:57.030 --> 04:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles come with a warning in the
 
04:43:58.708 --> 04:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
front of their owner's manual it says
 
04:44:02.390 --> 04:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
don't operate on public ways unless
 
04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
approved they're dangerous they're not
 
04:44:05.590 --> 04:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
designed for a public way
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
but my point is that's government that
 
04:44:09.430 --> 04:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
made that change that's government
 
04:44:10.948 --> 04:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
that's made
 
04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
the reason and the good cause for this
 
04:44:14.708 --> 04:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
abatement and
 
04:44:17.430 --> 04:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
i think a side benefit is selectmen will
 
04:44:19.270 --> 04:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
have to take
 
04:44:21.510 --> 04:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
the financial impact
 
04:44:23.350 --> 04:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
of making
 
04:44:25.910 --> 04:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
their town a recreational
 
04:44:28.948 --> 04:44:28.958 align:start position:0%
trail into account when they decide to
 
04:44:31.270 --> 04:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
do that in the future because they know
 
04:44:33.670 --> 04:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
that they may be affecting the property
 
04:44:36.230 --> 04:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
values of their citizens
 
04:44:38.390 --> 04:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
so it may give them something extra to
 
04:44:40.150 --> 04:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
think about thank you for your question
 
04:44:42.868 --> 04:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
04:44:44.868 --> 04:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question or
 
04:44:46.550 --> 04:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
04:44:48.430 --> 04:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to follow up on
 
04:44:50.788 --> 04:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
representative power's question
 
04:44:53.750 --> 04:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh apparently it's very easy
 
04:44:57.030 --> 04:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:59.430 --> 04:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
for the uh
 
04:45:01.590 --> 04:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
class five and six roads to be adopted
 
04:45:03.110 --> 04:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
as uh
 
04:45:03.120 --> 04:45:04.310 align:start position:0%
as uh
trails

04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
trails
 
04:45:04.320 --> 04:45:05.750 align:start position:0%
trails
uh

04:45:05.750 --> 04:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:07.750 --> 04:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
is it that easy to
 
04:45:07.760 --> 04:45:10.390 align:start position:0%
is it that easy to
uh

04:45:10.390 --> 04:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:14.628 --> 04:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:14.638 --> 04:45:16.150 align:start position:0%
 
interestingly

04:45:16.150 --> 04:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
interestingly
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement for a public
 
04:45:21.830 --> 04:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:23.670 --> 04:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
the decision to allow
 
04:45:25.830 --> 04:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
class five and six rows to become trails
 
04:45:29.350 --> 04:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
you do have to have a public hearing to
 
04:45:29.360 --> 04:45:30.390 align:start position:0%
you do have to have a public hearing to
stop

04:45:30.390 --> 04:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
stop
 
04:45:32.230 --> 04:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh class five or six year old from being
 
04:45:33.430 --> 04:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
a public
 
04:45:36.830 --> 04:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:39.590 --> 04:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
so in a sense i i would say it's harder
 
04:45:41.750 --> 04:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
to stop the nuisance once you've created
 
04:45:43.830 --> 04:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
it than it is to create it to begin with
 
04:45:46.390 --> 04:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
if that answers your question
 
04:45:46.400 --> 04:45:47.190 align:start position:0%
if that answers your question
uh

04:45:47.190 --> 04:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:48.628 --> 04:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
yes it does
 
04:45:50.948 --> 04:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
04:45:53.590 --> 04:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh continuing along that same line
 
04:45:56.150 --> 04:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
would you be looking to us to put in a
 
04:45:58.470 --> 04:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
requirement for a public hearing prior
 
04:46:01.910 --> 04:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
to designated one designating uh road
 
04:46:03.910 --> 04:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
for this type of activity
 
04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
there have been uh bills introduced and
 
04:46:08.470 --> 04:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
i think that issue has been addressed um

in other legislation so it is not
 
04:46:13.830 --> 04:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
something that this would need to
 
04:46:14.948 --> 04:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
that your committee would need to
 
04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%

04:47:11.990 --> 04:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
and they are all impacted by ohrvs going
 
04:47:14.230 --> 04:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
past their homes
 
04:47:16.788 --> 04:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
i absolutely agree with this bill that
 
04:47:20.230 --> 04:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
recreational off-highway vehicle use is
 
04:47:22.948 --> 04:47:22.958 align:start position:0%
cause for an abatement
 
04:47:25.990 --> 04:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
earlier someone asked about how much
 
04:47:27.270 --> 04:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
i would argue
 
04:47:28.708 --> 04:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
if it's five months of the year it
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
should be that percentage of their taxes
 
04:47:30.878 --> 04:47:32.070 align:start position:0%
should be that percentage of their taxes
removed

04:47:32.070 --> 04:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
removed
 
04:47:33.990 --> 04:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
because that is how long these people
 
04:47:37.110 --> 04:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
cannot enjoy their homes they run from
 
04:47:37.120 --> 04:47:38.628 align:start position:0%
cannot enjoy their homes they run from
them

04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:47:41.270 --> 04:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
many and i also i ask that you amend
 
04:47:46.868 --> 04:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:50.230 --> 04:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
route 2 and route 16 in gorham are open
 
04:47:53.750 --> 04:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
to ohrvs that was by a vote of the board
 
04:47:55.670 --> 04:47:55.680 align:start position:0%

04:48:05.350 --> 04:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
and these people they know what trucks
 
04:48:07.430 --> 04:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
sound like they know what motorcycles
 
04:48:10.310 --> 04:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
sound like and now they have hundreds of
 
04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
atvs going past their homes
 
04:48:15.990 --> 04:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
after committee meetings writing to
 
04:48:18.708 --> 04:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
officials on and on seven households in

04:48:24.470 --> 04:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
and the bureau of trails to have these
 
04:48:27.510 --> 04:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
atvs taken out of their neighborhood
 
04:48:29.430 --> 04:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general is using all
 
04:48:31.510 --> 04:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
its might to crush these seven
 
04:48:31.520 --> 04:48:33.430 align:start position:0%

um

04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:37.430 --> 04:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
atvs have been causing problems around

recreational vehicles
 
04:48:58.628 --> 04:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
as it worked the study committee found
 
04:49:01.510 --> 04:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
quote significant controversy regarding

operation of various kinds
 
04:49:09.350 --> 04:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
again as as a representative moynihan
 
04:49:11.350 --> 04:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
said it's well established that these
 
04:49:13.030 --> 04:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
things are a nuisance
 
04:49:15.830 --> 04:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
the atv concluded committee concluded
 
04:49:17.110 --> 04:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
that quote
 
04:49:20.470 --> 04:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
other trail uses low impact snowmobile
 
04:49:22.550 --> 04:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
and non-motorized conflict
 
04:49:25.110 --> 04:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
conflict with atv use
 
04:49:28.150 --> 04:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
new or expanded trails
 
04:49:31.670 --> 04:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
should be for atv use only and conflict
 
04:49:33.830 --> 04:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
issues will not arise
 
04:49:36.788 --> 04:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
i remind you this is from a 2001

ride the wilds was opened in 200 2013
 
04:49:44.948 --> 04:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
against this recommendation
 
04:49:47.750 --> 04:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
certainly residential life is an inc
 
04:49:47.760 --> 04:49:50.550 align:start position:0%
certainly residential life is an inc
incompatible

04:49:50.550 --> 04:49:50.560 align:start position:0%

04:49:53.350 --> 04:49:53.360 align:start position:0%

04:49:58.070 --> 04:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:50:01.990 --> 04:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
the policy of course and fine filtering
 
04:50:05.030 --> 04:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
must remain in place environmental
 
04:50:07.670 --> 04:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
concerns and the potential degradation
 
04:50:10.628 --> 04:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
of an area must always be the paramount
 
04:50:10.638 --> 04:50:12.230 align:start position:0%
of an area must always be the paramount
consideration

04:50:12.230 --> 04:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
04:50:13.990 --> 04:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
again these are neighborhoods being
 
04:50:17.110 --> 04:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
degraded by these trails
 
04:50:19.750 --> 04:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
another recommendation quote the
 
04:50:22.470 --> 04:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
emphasis should be on development of
 
04:50:26.788 --> 04:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
self-contained trails not linear trails
 
04:50:29.030 --> 04:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
and now you've got ride the wilds
 
04:50:32.150 --> 04:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
throughout coast county
 
04:50:34.868 --> 04:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
they are not self-contained
 
04:50:37.590 --> 04:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
these recommendations have been ignored
 
04:50:39.830 --> 04:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
and art and our towns have been turned
 
04:50:41.590 --> 04:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
into linear trails
 
04:50:43.510 --> 04:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
with homeowners subjected to hundreds of
 
04:50:46.550 --> 04:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
atvs roaring through
 
04:50:48.070 --> 04:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
as this committee
 
04:50:50.150 --> 04:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
is charged with municipal and county
 
04:50:50.160 --> 04:50:51.430 align:start position:0%

government
 
04:50:53.430 --> 04:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
i want to point out to you that there
 
04:50:55.590 --> 04:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
are two laws written to protect new
 
04:50:58.550 --> 04:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens from recreational
 
04:51:01.550 --> 04:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
off-highway vehicle use
 
04:51:06.310 --> 04:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
rsa-236 cohen 56 roman 2d
 
04:51:09.190 --> 04:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
and rsa-215a10
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
both of these
 
04:51:13.830 --> 04:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
exempt costs from the protections that
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
are written for the entire state if you
 
04:51:18.070 --> 04:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
live in another county you have more
 
04:51:20.230 --> 04:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
protections from ohrvs than you do in
 
04:51:20.240 --> 04:51:21.670 align:start position:0%
protections from ohrvs than you do in
coast

04:51:21.670 --> 04:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
coast
 
04:51:23.830 --> 04:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:51:25.990 --> 04:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
as you consider if recreational
 
04:51:27.910 --> 04:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
off-highway vehicle use is an avatable
 
04:51:27.920 --> 04:51:28.868 align:start position:0%
off-highway vehicle use is an avatable
cause

04:51:28.868 --> 04:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
cause
 
04:51:31.030 --> 04:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
know that co-op citizens are denied
 
04:51:33.030 --> 04:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
equal protections in law by these
 
04:51:33.040 --> 04:51:34.470 align:start position:0%
equal protections in law by these
exemptions

04:51:34.470 --> 04:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
04:51:35.510 --> 04:51:35.520 align:start position:0%

04:52:35.270 --> 04:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
roaring through
 
04:52:37.750 --> 04:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
so when my my friends down at the
 
04:52:40.628 --> 04:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
trailhead their homes are 60 feet from
 
04:52:43.350 --> 04:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
these trails my heart breaks for them
 
04:52:45.030 --> 04:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
and to your question
 
04:52:46.948 --> 04:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
no this appointment won't give them what
 
04:52:48.788 --> 04:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
they want they want their road they want
 
04:52:50.230 --> 04:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
their lives back they want their
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:58.550 --> 04:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that
 
04:53:00.310 --> 04:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
you think this ought to be expanded to
 
04:53:04.390 --> 04:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
include all public ways let me suggest
 
04:53:06.230 --> 04:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
talk to that man right over there under
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
the clock uh
 
04:53:10.868 --> 04:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
representative renzolo and see if he if
 
04:53:12.868 --> 04:53:12.878 align:start position:0%
he wants to expand
 
04:53:14.390 --> 04:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:53:16.550 --> 04:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
the legislation to include that yeah and
 
04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is because the
 
04:53:21.110 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
gorham selectmen were involved in every
 
04:53:23.750 --> 04:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
decision to open every atv trail in
 
04:53:26.868 --> 04:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
gorham on private land on the rail trail
 
04:53:30.470 --> 04:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
on the state roads on the town roads
 
04:53:32.070 --> 04:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions yes
 
04:53:32.080 --> 04:53:34.150 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions yes
representative

04:53:34.150 --> 04:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:53:35.590 --> 04:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
04:53:37.110 --> 04:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:53:40.150 --> 04:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
um is it your consideration that
 
04:53:43.350 --> 04:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
um ohrv use is incompatible with other
 
04:53:45.990 --> 04:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
uses of the trails such as bicycles
 
04:53:48.150 --> 04:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
walking horseback riding any of those
 
04:53:48.160 --> 04:53:49.110 align:start position:0%
walking horseback riding any of those
things

04:53:49.110 --> 04:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:53:52.230 --> 04:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
yes and it was established in the 2001
 
04:53:53.670 --> 04:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
04:53:55.350 --> 04:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:53:57.030 --> 04:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
every state does a statewide
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
comprehensive outdoor recreation plan
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
and wisconsin they have
 
04:54:05.350 --> 04:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
a chart that shows that ohrv riding is
 
04:54:07.270 --> 04:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
highly antagonistic
 
04:54:07.280 --> 04:54:08.150 align:start position:0%
highly antagonistic
with

04:54:08.150 --> 04:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:54:11.030 --> 04:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
eight out of nine other recreation
 
04:54:13.590 --> 04:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
recreational uses and they are still
 
04:54:15.750 --> 04:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
moderately antagonistic even with
 
04:54:15.760 --> 04:54:17.510 align:start position:0%
moderately antagonistic even with
snowmobiles

04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles
 
04:54:20.310 --> 04:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
so it's it's established it has nothing
 
04:54:23.350 --> 04:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:25.110 --> 04:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:27.750 --> 04:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:54:28.788 --> 04:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
oh yes
 
04:54:28.798 --> 04:54:31.590 align:start position:0%
oh yes

04:54:33.670 --> 04:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions
 
04:54:35.830 --> 04:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
up in your area isn't the
 
04:54:38.788 --> 04:54:38.798 align:start position:0%
ohiv a fairly big part of the economy
 
04:54:40.868 --> 04:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
for the community
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
it is a loud part of the economy
 
04:54:44.868 --> 04:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
we live
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
we abut the white mountain national
 
04:54:49.110 --> 04:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
forest which brings millions of visitors
 
04:54:49.120 --> 04:54:49.910 align:start position:0%
forest which brings millions of visitors
in

04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:54:52.230 --> 04:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
gorham has been a tourist town
 
04:54:52.240 --> 04:54:53.430 align:start position:0%
gorham has been a tourist town
for

04:54:53.430 --> 04:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:54:56.070 --> 04:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
over a century people coming in for the
 
04:54:58.628 --> 04:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
quiet of the mountains hiking
 
04:55:01.590 --> 04:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
if you look at fish and game statistics
 
04:55:01.600 --> 04:55:03.030 align:start position:0%
if you look at fish and game statistics
uh

04:55:03.030 --> 04:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:55:05.510 --> 04:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
far more fishing license fishing
 
04:55:05.520 --> 04:55:06.788 align:start position:0%
far more fishing license fishing
licenses

04:55:06.788 --> 04:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
04:55:08.310 --> 04:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
well over a hundred thousand fishing
 
04:55:10.310 --> 04:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
licenses are sold every year
 
04:55:13.670 --> 04:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
and actually before kovid atv
 
04:55:13.680 --> 04:55:15.350 align:start position:0%
and actually before kovid atv
registrations

04:55:15.350 --> 04:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
registrations
 
04:55:18.628 --> 04:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
had started to decline and they were at
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
i don't know 36 37 38 000 and it's
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
over a hundred thousand fishing licenses
 
04:55:27.590 --> 04:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't know anyone disturbed in
 
04:55:32.230 --> 04:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:35.510 --> 04:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
i may have a lakefront property
 
04:55:36.868 --> 04:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
in a channel
 
04:55:39.030 --> 04:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
and there may be four or 500 boats that
 
04:55:40.708 --> 04:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
go past my house
 
04:55:43.430 --> 04:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
every day with loud motors should i also
 
04:55:49.670 --> 04:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
i just know that this has been a drastic
 
04:55:54.948 --> 04:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
change in use
 
04:55:57.030 --> 04:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
in our community and that noise
 
04:56:01.270 --> 04:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
pollution is a serious health problem
 
04:56:02.948 --> 04:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
i i think there's no reason for any
 
04:56:05.350 --> 04:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
motor to be that loud
 
04:56:06.830 --> 04:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
04:56:10.708 --> 04:56:10.718 align:start position:0%
you yes representative
 
04:56:12.708 --> 04:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:56:15.110 --> 04:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
and yet another question
 
04:56:18.070 --> 04:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of any health
 
04:56:21.190 --> 04:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
effects negative effects of children in
 
04:56:24.628 --> 04:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
your communities especially young ones
 
04:56:26.550 --> 04:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
with you know loud noise
 
04:56:28.390 --> 04:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
and not being able to
 
04:56:31.350 --> 04:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
sleep or
 
04:56:34.070 --> 04:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
a hearing problem because of that
 
04:56:37.430 --> 04:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any of those things
 
04:56:40.230 --> 04:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
no not as it pertains to
 
04:56:41.910 --> 04:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
young children
 
04:56:43.670 --> 04:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
i do know a friend of mine was walking
 
04:56:45.350 --> 04:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
on the sidewalk
 
04:56:45.360 --> 04:56:46.230 align:start position:0%
on the sidewalk
and

04:56:46.230 --> 04:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
an atv revved right next to her and
 
04:56:51.430 --> 04:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
caused temporary hearing damage
 
04:56:54.070 --> 04:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
so but it is established that
 
04:56:54.080 --> 04:56:55.350 align:start position:0%
so but it is established that
loud

04:56:55.350 --> 04:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
loud
 
04:56:58.310 --> 04:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
decibels of this
 
04:56:58.320 --> 04:56:59.430 align:start position:0%
decibels of this
size

04:56:59.430 --> 04:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
size
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:07.830 --> 04:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh i have a question um going back to
 
04:57:12.868 --> 04:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:16.390 --> 04:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:19.510 --> 04:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
if you can get an abatement or a larger
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
invade abatement
 
04:57:23.270 --> 04:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
the homeowners may get a couple hundred
 
04:57:23.280 --> 04:57:24.390 align:start position:0%
the homeowners may get a couple hundred
dollars

04:57:24.390 --> 04:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:57:30.070 --> 04:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.230 --> 04:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
might i suggest that that's not really
 
04:57:34.230 --> 04:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
what they're looking for
 
04:57:37.190 --> 04:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
i would completely agree with you sir so
 
04:57:38.470 --> 04:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
04:57:40.150 --> 04:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
my thought would be
 
04:57:42.070 --> 04:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
we're gonna
 
04:57:43.830 --> 04:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
we're gonna vote on whether we support
 
04:57:46.470 --> 04:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
this or not but
 
04:57:49.350 --> 04:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
i might suggest that you gather
 
04:57:51.990 --> 04:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
the impacted
 
04:57:53.830 --> 04:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
families together and say what do we
 
04:57:57.190 --> 04:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
really want out of this do we want
 
04:57:59.430 --> 04:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
the ohrvs to go away
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
do we want something else we want a
 
04:58:04.390 --> 04:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
larger barrier between
 
04:58:07.350 --> 04:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
where they go and where our houses are
 
04:58:09.990 --> 04:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
so so that's the thing i think i think
 
04:58:10.000 --> 04:58:11.110 align:start position:0%
so so that's the thing i think i think
uh

04:58:11.110 --> 04:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
once you get larger abatements
 
04:58:17.190 --> 04:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
your account your accountant may be
 
04:58:18.628 --> 04:58:18.638 align:start position:0%
happy because
 
04:58:19.750 --> 04:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a little bit more
 
04:58:21.910 --> 04:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
money in
 
04:58:23.830 --> 04:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
in this tax return
 
04:58:26.230 --> 04:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't take any of the noise the
 
04:58:26.240 --> 04:58:27.350 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't take any of the noise the
dust

04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
dust
 
04:58:29.510 --> 04:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
the nuisance doesn't take any of that
 
04:58:29.520 --> 04:58:30.550 align:start position:0%
the nuisance doesn't take any of that
away

04:58:30.550 --> 04:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
away
 
04:58:30.560 --> 04:58:32.070 align:start position:0%
away
and

04:58:32.070 --> 04:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:58:32.080 --> 04:58:32.788 align:start position:0%
and
i

04:58:32.788 --> 04:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:58:35.110 --> 04:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm not
 
04:58:36.948 --> 04:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
i'm reflecting on the fact that i'm not
 
04:58:39.910 --> 04:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
sure this is what you really want
 
04:58:43.510 --> 04:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
i agree with your assessment it's um
 
04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
they want their homes back they want
 
04:58:46.550 --> 04:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
these trails removed from their
 
04:58:48.150 --> 04:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods where they were put in
 
04:58:50.948 --> 04:58:50.958 align:start position:0%
without any notification
 
04:58:52.868 --> 04:58:52.878 align:start position:0%
um they want their zoning
 
04:58:54.470 --> 04:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
honored these are residential
 
04:58:57.270 --> 04:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods we gorham has
 
04:58:59.030 --> 04:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
a noise ordinances
 
04:59:01.030 --> 04:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
a noise ordinance
 
04:59:03.510 --> 04:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
you roosters were prohibited when this
 
04:59:06.788 --> 04:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:06.798 --> 04:59:07.990 align:start position:0%
 
roosters

04:59:07.990 --> 04:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
roosters
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
and you could have no more than five or
 
04:59:13.350 --> 04:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
six chickens and they could not be in
 
04:59:16.788 --> 04:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
nuisance by noise or odor that was the
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
standing ordinance when the select board
 
04:59:22.390 --> 04:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
voted to allow off highway recreational
 
04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles to travel through this
 
04:59:26.948 --> 04:59:26.958 align:start position:0%
residential neighborhood
 
04:59:29.750 --> 04:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay we have the we have the legislation
 
04:59:31.910 --> 04:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
the proposed to us
 
04:59:34.390 --> 04:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
we will evaluate that and you have my
 
04:59:34.400 --> 04:59:35.350 align:start position:0%
we will evaluate that and you have my
advice

04:59:35.350 --> 04:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
advice
 
04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
to think about maybe think about a
 
04:59:39.350 --> 04:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
little different way of what you really
 
04:59:39.360 --> 04:59:40.868 align:start position:0%
little different way of what you really
want

04:59:40.868 --> 04:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
want
 
04:59:44.470 --> 04:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
and it's too late now to change that
 
04:59:46.310 --> 04:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
for this year but maybe next year you
 
04:59:47.750 --> 04:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
could come back and say this is what we
 
04:59:50.470 --> 04:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
really want yes representative vann
 
04:59:52.470 --> 04:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
04:59:54.390 --> 04:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
another question uh
 
04:59:56.310 --> 04:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
do you consider that it's likely that
 
04:59:58.868 --> 04:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
the select board may reconsider their
 
05:00:00.708 --> 05:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
decisions if they have to start shelling
 
05:00:02.708 --> 05:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
out abatement after abatement after
 
05:00:02.718 --> 05:00:04.868 align:start position:0%
out abatement after abatement after
abatement

05:00:04.868 --> 05:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
abatement
 
05:00:07.830 --> 05:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
i think other citizens might care
 
05:00:09.910 --> 05:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
might start to care
 
05:00:14.150 --> 05:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:16.390 --> 05:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh right now people
 
05:00:17.750 --> 05:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
if it's not
 
05:00:19.910 --> 05:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
the use is very much concentrated in
 
05:00:21.830 --> 05:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
different areas of town the burden is
 
05:00:24.150 --> 05:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
not distributed equally so some citizens
 
05:00:26.310 --> 05:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
are suffering terribly
 
05:00:28.550 --> 05:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
and other citizens are saying oh it's
 
05:00:30.628 --> 05:00:30.638 align:start position:0%
not in my neighborhood i'm okay
 
05:00:32.788 --> 05:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
so if their bill started going up
 
05:00:34.628 --> 05:00:34.638 align:start position:0%
because this other neighborhood was
 
05:00:36.708 --> 05:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
negatively impacted they might start to
 
05:00:36.718 --> 05:00:39.110 align:start position:0%
negatively impacted they might start to
care

05:00:39.110 --> 05:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:40.628 --> 05:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:00:42.708 --> 05:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
seeing no final questions i want to
 
05:00:44.948 --> 05:00:44.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
05:00:47.750 --> 05:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
next we're going to hear from nhma mr
 
05:00:47.760 --> 05:00:52.470 align:start position:0%
next we're going to hear from nhma mr
grays

05:00:52.470 --> 05:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:54.150 --> 05:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman h grace for the
 
05:00:56.310 --> 05:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association i'm
 
05:00:58.390 --> 05:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
just commenting on this bill we do not
 
05:01:00.310 --> 05:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
have a position
 
05:01:01.590 --> 05:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
there are a couple questions that
 
05:01:03.990 --> 05:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
committee members asked earlier that i
 
05:01:05.590 --> 05:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
do want to address believe
 
05:01:07.350 --> 05:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative power asked about the
 
05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
current process for opening
 
05:01:12.230 --> 05:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
and closing roads to ohrvs
 
05:01:15.350 --> 05:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's found under rsa 215 hyphen a
 
05:01:18.628 --> 05:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
colon 6 roman 9
 
05:01:22.868 --> 05:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
that also references references rsa 215
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
hyphen a colon 15.
 
05:01:28.070 --> 05:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
essentially what that requires is that
 
05:01:30.550 --> 05:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
there be a public notice
 
05:01:33.110 --> 05:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
with it with notice to the abutters on
 
05:01:35.030 --> 05:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
the affected roads
 
05:01:38.070 --> 05:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
and that notice has to go out uh 14 days
 
05:01:39.430 --> 05:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
in advance
 
05:01:41.990 --> 05:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
of that public hearing
 
05:01:44.070 --> 05:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
and after that conclusion that hearing
 
05:01:45.750 --> 05:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
the governing body can vote whether to
 
05:01:47.670 --> 05:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
open or close the road
 
05:01:49.190 --> 05:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
and additionally the
 
05:01:51.190 --> 05:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
costs of providing notice both to the
 
05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
abutters and posting notice generally
 
05:01:55.990 --> 05:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
is borne by whoever the petitioning
 
05:01:58.550 --> 05:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
party is so if it's the local ohrv club
 
05:02:00.390 --> 05:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
they would pay for if it's the
 
05:02:01.910 --> 05:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
homeowners that want to close the road
 
05:02:03.830 --> 05:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
they would pay for it
 
05:02:07.190 --> 05:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the this change
 
05:02:10.550 --> 05:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
occurred i think two or three years ago
 
05:02:12.390 --> 05:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
and it didn't affect any current
 
05:02:14.470 --> 05:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
disposition so
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
if a road was currently open to ohrvs
 
05:02:19.030 --> 05:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
and then a group got together and wanted
 
05:02:20.310 --> 05:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
to close it
 
05:02:21.910 --> 05:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
you know they'd have this new process
 
05:02:23.670 --> 05:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
they would have to go through which is
 
05:02:26.470 --> 05:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
which is what um some of the discrepancy
 
05:02:27.990 --> 05:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
that was described earlier today might
 
05:02:29.910 --> 05:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
have might have covered
 
05:02:29.920 --> 05:02:30.708 align:start position:0%
have might have covered
um

05:02:30.708 --> 05:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:32.310 --> 05:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
05:02:34.948 --> 05:02:34.958 align:start position:0%
this bill goes
 
05:02:34.958 --> 05:02:35.750 align:start position:0%
this bill goes
under

05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:02:39.510 --> 05:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
rsa 76 colon 16
 
05:02:41.350 --> 05:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
the selectmen or assessors for good
 
05:02:44.150 --> 05:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
cause shown may abate any tax including
 
05:02:46.150 --> 05:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
prior years taxes assessed by them or
 
05:02:47.990 --> 05:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
their predecessors including any portion
 
05:02:50.708 --> 05:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
of interest accrued on such tax
 
05:02:53.350 --> 05:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
the term good cause shown is not defined
 
05:02:54.708 --> 05:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
in the statute
 
05:02:57.670 --> 05:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do is simply add
 
05:02:57.680 --> 05:02:59.510 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do is simply add
a

05:02:59.510 --> 05:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:02:59.520 --> 05:03:00.788 align:start position:0%
a
and

05:03:00.788 --> 05:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:02.470 --> 05:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
partial definition
 
05:03:04.150 --> 05:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
and then it says that good cause shall
 
05:03:04.160 --> 05:03:05.350 align:start position:0%
and then it says that good cause shall
include

05:03:05.350 --> 05:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
include
 
05:03:09.110 --> 05:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
allowed recreational use of ohrvs on
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
and then if it's amended potentially
 
05:03:12.628 --> 05:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
more than just class six and class six
 
05:03:15.590 --> 05:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
roads or class five and class six roads
 
05:03:18.230 --> 05:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
um i would suggest the committee that
 
05:03:20.390 --> 05:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
the term good cause is purposely vague
 
05:03:20.400 --> 05:03:21.350 align:start position:0%
the term good cause is purposely vague
here

05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:03:22.948 --> 05:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
essentially if you can go to the select
 
05:03:25.350 --> 05:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
board and make a good argument about why
 
05:03:27.270 --> 05:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
your property was incorrectly valued
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
during the assessment process
 
05:03:31.590 --> 05:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
they could give you an abatement
 
05:03:33.430 --> 05:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
and that's going to vary
 
05:03:35.270 --> 05:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
typically it's going to be related to
 
05:03:37.350 --> 05:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
the property itself
 
05:03:39.590 --> 05:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps the the select board is
 
05:03:41.830 --> 05:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
unaware of the fact that you had some
 
05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:03:44.628 --> 05:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
termite investigation or something like
 
05:03:46.230 --> 05:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
that that totally destroyed the inside
 
05:03:47.910 --> 05:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
of the property and therefore the value
 
05:03:49.670 --> 05:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
or the building in there the property is
 
05:03:49.680 --> 05:03:50.390 align:start position:0%
or the building in there the property is
not

05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:03:52.550 --> 05:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
as highly valued but it could have
 
05:03:54.470 --> 05:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
external causes as well
 
05:03:56.470 --> 05:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
one of the common ones is if someone is
 
05:03:58.470 --> 05:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
receiving municipal welfare they
 
05:04:00.708 --> 05:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
obviously can't pay their taxes because
 
05:04:02.070 --> 05:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know they need assistance from the
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
town they're not
 
05:04:05.270 --> 05:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
they don't have the means to pay for a
 
05:04:07.110 --> 05:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
lot of things so it doesn't make sense
 
05:04:09.190 --> 05:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
to tax them because the select board
 
05:04:10.708 --> 05:04:10.718 align:start position:0%
would just be
 
05:04:12.550 --> 05:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
paying them to pay themselves it would
 
05:04:14.628 --> 05:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
be it would be a circle
 
05:04:17.430 --> 05:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
um so to representative guthrie's point
 
05:04:17.440 --> 05:04:18.628 align:start position:0%
um so to representative guthrie's point
earlier

05:04:18.628 --> 05:04:18.638 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
05:04:21.190 --> 05:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
presumably if properties are valued
 
05:04:23.110 --> 05:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
correctly at the assessment stage there
 
05:04:24.948 --> 05:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
would be no need for
 
05:04:27.110 --> 05:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
for an abatement
 
05:04:28.470 --> 05:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
but because
 
05:04:30.830 --> 05:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
we already have this vague term good
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
cause presumably if you had
 
05:04:37.670 --> 05:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
loud boats loud motorcycles loud ohrvs
 
05:04:39.270 --> 05:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
and could convince the select four that
 
05:04:43.110 --> 05:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
that was caused to devalue your property
 
05:04:45.270 --> 05:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
you could get an abatement for that
 
05:04:47.030 --> 05:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
but as i stated the the municipal
 
05:04:49.270 --> 05:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
association does not have a position
 
05:04:51.350 --> 05:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
i do want to note um
 
05:04:54.310 --> 05:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
that currently there's there is a bill
 
05:04:55.990 --> 05:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
two different bills
 
05:04:57.270 --> 05:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
working through
 
05:04:59.750 --> 05:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
05:05:01.190 --> 05:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's hb
 
05:05:03.750 --> 05:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
1109 which the sponsor
 
05:05:05.270 --> 05:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
also sponsored
 
05:05:06.788 --> 05:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
that would change the process for
 
05:05:10.470 --> 05:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
opening and closing roads to ohrvs
 
05:05:12.470 --> 05:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
to be a legislative body vote instead of
 
05:05:14.550 --> 05:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
a governing body vote
 
05:05:17.190 --> 05:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
there's also hp 1188 which is go would
 
05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
create a commission to study ohrv use in
 
05:05:20.628 --> 05:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:05:22.230 --> 05:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
it's a very broad
 
05:05:22.240 --> 05:05:23.910 align:start position:0%
it's a very broad
commission

05:05:23.910 --> 05:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
presumably it would cover
 
05:05:26.160 --> 05:05:27.030 align:start position:0%
presumably it would cover
whether

05:05:27.030 --> 05:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
whether
 
05:05:28.628 --> 05:05:28.638 align:start position:0%
any change needs to be made to the
 
05:05:28.638 --> 05:05:29.670 align:start position:0%
any change needs to be made to the
abatement

05:05:29.670 --> 05:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
abatement
 
05:05:33.030 --> 05:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
process as well but um i think it would
 
05:05:34.550 --> 05:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
i think it would cover a lot of what
 
05:05:36.390 --> 05:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
chairman dolan pointed out to the
 
05:05:38.470 --> 05:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
previous speaker in terms of what we
 
05:05:40.390 --> 05:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
want to do as a state and state policy
 
05:05:42.868 --> 05:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
regarding ohrvis
 
05:05:43.990 --> 05:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:46.628 --> 05:05:46.638 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
05:05:49.030 --> 05:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr grace uh
 
05:05:51.510 --> 05:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
could you just tell me where these hb
 
05:05:54.470 --> 05:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
1109 and 1188 are
 
05:05:56.310 --> 05:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
i believe both are in the resources
 
05:05:58.788 --> 05:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
recreation and development committee i'm
 
05:06:01.510 --> 05:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
not sure if they've been um exact or not
 
05:06:03.590 --> 05:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:05.350 --> 05:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
it's representative guthrie
 
05:06:07.190 --> 05:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you again
 
05:06:09.110 --> 05:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
as i said before i'm a selectman in
 
05:06:10.958 --> 05:06:12.070 align:start position:0%
as i said before i'm a selectman in
hampstead

05:06:12.070 --> 05:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
hampstead
 
05:06:12.080 --> 05:06:12.948 align:start position:0%
hampstead
and

05:06:12.948 --> 05:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:06:14.708 --> 05:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
we've always felt that you can obey for
 
05:06:14.718 --> 05:06:15.750 align:start position:0%
we've always felt that you can obey for
anything

05:06:15.750 --> 05:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
anything
 
05:06:18.310 --> 05:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
correct it's in the eye there is a ball
 
05:06:20.310 --> 05:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
beholder and this bill
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
is not what would i be correct if i said
 
05:06:25.990 --> 05:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is not
 
05:06:28.868 --> 05:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
necessary for the process to go forward
 
05:06:31.350 --> 05:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
for a request for an ape an abatement
 
05:06:34.070 --> 05:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
and they the homeowners can request an
 
05:06:37.110 --> 05:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
abatement at any time for any reason
 
05:06:39.990 --> 05:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
and they really don't need this tool if
 
05:06:43.110 --> 05:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
you will to go forward with the problem
 
05:06:45.190 --> 05:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's my interpretation as well
 
05:06:46.948 --> 05:06:46.958 align:start position:0%
it sounded like some of the testimonies
 
05:06:48.788 --> 05:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
today that they were really looking for
 
05:06:51.270 --> 05:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
a tax credit not an abatement now follow
 
05:06:53.510 --> 05:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
up if i could mr trump it's been
 
05:06:55.110 --> 05:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
to i've asked the question a couple of
 
05:06:57.590 --> 05:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
times i guess but
 
05:07:00.470 --> 05:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding that the
 
05:07:02.628 --> 05:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
conditions that we're talking about in
 
05:07:05.110 --> 05:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
this these situations cannot be
 
05:07:07.910 --> 05:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
considered when the original abatement
 
05:07:10.550 --> 05:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:12.628 --> 05:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
well i would as
 
05:07:14.070 --> 05:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
my understanding of how the assessment
 
05:07:16.230 --> 05:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
process works is that
 
05:07:17.750 --> 05:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
the assessment
 
05:07:20.628 --> 05:07:20.638 align:start position:0%
should take into account the value of
 
05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
the property and the value of the
 
05:07:24.310 --> 05:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
property would be based on
 
05:07:25.910 --> 05:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
whatever the market would support so
 
05:07:28.550 --> 05:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
presumably if you're next to a large
 
05:07:28.560 --> 05:07:29.670 align:start position:0%
presumably if you're next to a large
factory

05:07:29.670 --> 05:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
factory
 
05:07:31.270 --> 05:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
your property is going to be less even
 
05:07:32.310 --> 05:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
if the
 
05:07:34.788 --> 05:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
exact you know building and the exact
 
05:07:36.150 --> 05:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
size of the property the same as
 
05:07:38.310 --> 05:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
something across town because
 
05:07:41.270 --> 05:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
there are outside factors there
 
05:07:44.310 --> 05:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
presumably that could take into account
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
um the use of the roadways as well
 
05:07:49.590 --> 05:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
i you know
 
05:07:51.270 --> 05:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
this all gets very complex and is way
 
05:07:55.030 --> 05:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
above my pay grade um but i am too as i
 
05:07:58.070 --> 05:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
said presumably if it's correctly valued
 
05:07:59.430 --> 05:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
in the first place you don't need to
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
have an abatement because everyone's
 
05:08:02.788 --> 05:08:02.798 align:start position:0%
paying what they should be paying based
 
05:08:04.628 --> 05:08:04.638 align:start position:0%
on what the value the property the
 
05:08:06.230 --> 05:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
various properties are
 
05:08:06.240 --> 05:08:07.110 align:start position:0%
various properties are
um

05:08:07.110 --> 05:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:09.190 --> 05:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
but if they can come in and say hey you
 
05:08:11.590 --> 05:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
missed this that's really the basis of
 
05:08:13.030 --> 05:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
the abatement
 
05:08:15.510 --> 05:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
i suggest to you if i may mr chairman
 
05:08:17.430 --> 05:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
that the whoever the
 
05:08:20.470 --> 05:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
assessors are in these communities
 
05:08:22.550 --> 05:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
are to
 
05:08:24.150 --> 05:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
take a look at what they're doing and
 
05:08:26.550 --> 05:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
how they're valuing those homes
 
05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
i will pass that on
 
05:08:31.670 --> 05:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative
 
05:08:33.190 --> 05:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr
 
05:08:35.190 --> 05:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry mr chair and uh thank you for
 
05:08:38.708 --> 05:08:38.718 align:start position:0%
taking my call um i i think um the the
 
05:08:40.628 --> 05:08:40.638 align:start position:0%
previous speaker uh
 
05:08:41.750 --> 05:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
hit what some of the things that i
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:48.868 --> 05:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
05:08:50.628 --> 05:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
is there potential
 
05:08:52.390 --> 05:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
by naming this specifically that we're
 
05:08:54.868 --> 05:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
going to create a slippery slope of
 
05:08:54.878 --> 05:08:56.070 align:start position:0%
going to create a slippery slope of
boats

05:08:56.070 --> 05:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
boats
 
05:08:59.190 --> 05:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
public roads trains going by
 
05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
recently nashua had a train idle for
 
05:09:03.190 --> 05:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
nine and a half hours by a residential
 
05:09:03.200 --> 05:09:04.070 align:start position:0%
nine and a half hours by a residential
area

05:09:04.070 --> 05:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
area
 
05:09:07.270 --> 05:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
would all of those kind of things um
 
05:09:07.280 --> 05:09:08.070 align:start position:0%
would all of those kind of things um
fall

05:09:08.070 --> 05:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
fall
 
05:09:10.390 --> 05:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
because suddenly become named in future
 
05:09:10.400 --> 05:09:11.990 align:start position:0%
because suddenly become named in future
bills

05:09:11.990 --> 05:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
bills
 
05:09:13.590 --> 05:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question so what
 
05:09:13.600 --> 05:09:14.868 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question so what
i've

05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
i've
 
05:09:16.868 --> 05:09:16.878 align:start position:0%
i think that we've seen in the history
 
05:09:17.990 --> 05:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
of the development of the law in new
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire is we've typically started out
 
05:09:22.310 --> 05:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
with specific lists and those have
 
05:09:25.110 --> 05:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
gotten very long and various statutes so
 
05:09:27.030 --> 05:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
for example
 
05:09:30.470 --> 05:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
um under rsa 53a
 
05:09:31.990 --> 05:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
multiple communities can join into
 
05:09:33.910 --> 05:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
cooperative agreements and it used to be
 
05:09:35.350 --> 05:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
that it was for a
 
05:09:37.910 --> 05:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
long and then increasingly long list of
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
specific things and then at some point
 
05:09:41.190 --> 05:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature said hey this doesn't
 
05:09:43.430 --> 05:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
make sense let's just say
 
05:09:45.110 --> 05:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
you can enter into those agreements for
 
05:09:46.868 --> 05:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
anything you could lawfully do
 
05:09:49.990 --> 05:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
um so in the kind of the same vein
 
05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
kind of just
 
05:09:54.070 --> 05:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
letting it be a vague good cause allows
 
05:09:55.670 --> 05:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
different select boards to make
 
05:09:57.990 --> 05:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
different decisions um it's
 
05:10:01.110 --> 05:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
rather than have a very long list
 
05:10:03.510 --> 05:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
05:10:05.510 --> 05:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question would be
 
05:10:07.030 --> 05:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
would you make better recommendation
 
05:10:08.310 --> 05:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
because i think these people are
 
05:10:11.430 --> 05:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
suffering um closer to what um chairman
 
05:10:13.110 --> 05:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
dolan had said of
 
05:10:15.750 --> 05:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
of trying to
 
05:10:17.830 --> 05:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
to get these roads to be more approved
 
05:10:19.910 --> 05:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
or pulled back or something that would
 
05:10:22.150 --> 05:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
that be a better recommendation for the
 
05:10:23.750 --> 05:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
towns and cities
 
05:10:23.760 --> 05:10:24.628 align:start position:0%
towns and cities
um

05:10:24.628 --> 05:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:24.638 --> 05:10:25.350 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:10:25.350 --> 05:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:10:27.350 --> 05:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
i don't have a specific policy
 
05:10:30.470 --> 05:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation um i i did note that you
 
05:10:32.788 --> 05:10:32.798 align:start position:0%
know there is hp 1109 if that's
 
05:10:33.910 --> 05:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
something that
 
05:10:33.920 --> 05:10:34.830 align:start position:0%
something that
um

05:10:34.830 --> 05:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:37.030 --> 05:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:10:38.230 --> 05:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature want to
 
05:10:40.868 --> 05:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
consider um as an option
 
05:10:40.878 --> 05:10:41.750 align:start position:0%
consider um as an option
um

05:10:41.750 --> 05:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:44.470 --> 05:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
certainly there's there's also um
 
05:10:47.910 --> 05:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
1118 hp 11 18 for a commission
 
05:10:47.920 --> 05:10:49.190 align:start position:0%
1118 hp 11 18 for a commission
um

05:10:49.190 --> 05:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:51.030 --> 05:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
i've been in a number of these ohrv
 
05:10:52.550 --> 05:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
hearings over in resources recreation
 
05:10:54.310 --> 05:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
development i can tell you they packed
 
05:10:56.070 --> 05:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
the room they're usually
 
05:10:58.708 --> 05:10:58.718 align:start position:0%
like 100 speakers um it takes the whole
 
05:11:01.350 --> 05:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
day it's a very controversial issue i i
 
05:11:03.670 --> 05:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
can't solve it
 
05:11:04.788 --> 05:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:11:04.798 --> 05:11:06.708 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

05:11:06.708 --> 05:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:11:08.628 --> 05:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
05:11:10.948 --> 05:11:10.958 align:start position:0%
grace for taking my question you talked
 
05:11:14.070 --> 05:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
about market value being a basis for
 
05:11:17.510 --> 05:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
determining the assessed value
 
05:11:20.150 --> 05:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
from your experience maybe attending
 
05:11:21.990 --> 05:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
some of those hearings by resources and
 
05:11:24.070 --> 05:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
from testimony of her today
 
05:11:29.110 --> 05:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:29.120 --> 05:11:30.788 align:start position:0%
 
trail

05:11:30.788 --> 05:11:30.798 align:start position:0%
trail
 
05:11:33.110 --> 05:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
if that's being on the market and shown
 
05:11:35.110 --> 05:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
let's say in april
 
05:11:37.030 --> 05:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
would you expect it would be the same
 
05:11:39.190 --> 05:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
market value then maybe three months
 
05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
later with the traffic that's been
 
05:11:41.280 --> 05:11:42.470 align:start position:0%
later with the traffic that's been
described

05:11:42.470 --> 05:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
described
 
05:11:45.110 --> 05:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
or would the market value change because
 
05:11:48.628 --> 05:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
of the nuisance of the noise and dirt
 
05:11:50.948 --> 05:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question now i'm
 
05:11:52.708 --> 05:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
speculating here
 
05:11:52.718 --> 05:11:54.150 align:start position:0%
speculating here
but

05:11:54.150 --> 05:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:11:56.070 --> 05:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
i assume that assessments are based on
 
05:11:58.788 --> 05:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
the selling value sales value and
 
05:12:00.470 --> 05:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
presumably the person selling the
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
properties isn't going to want to
 
05:12:03.510 --> 05:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
disclose anything that might be
 
05:12:05.270 --> 05:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
considered a defect
 
05:12:07.110 --> 05:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
whether that's you know the boiler is
 
05:12:09.190 --> 05:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
about to go or whether there's a huge
 
05:12:10.628 --> 05:12:10.638 align:start position:0%
amount of traffic during certain times
 
05:12:11.590 --> 05:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
of year
 
05:12:13.510 --> 05:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:12:13.520 --> 05:12:15.030 align:start position:0%
um and
it's

05:12:15.030 --> 05:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:12:16.948 --> 05:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
the the old the old saying is buyer
 
05:12:19.830 --> 05:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
beware and so the the buyer is going to
 
05:12:21.990 --> 05:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
have to be savvy enough to sort of suss
 
05:12:23.990 --> 05:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
that out with you know the assistance of
 
05:12:26.830 --> 05:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
their real estate agent if any
 
05:12:30.390 --> 05:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
um that does cause problems because it's
 
05:12:31.750 --> 05:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
certainly something you might not
 
05:12:33.430 --> 05:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily know if you're not from that
 
05:12:34.948 --> 05:12:34.958 align:start position:0%
community that that might be an issue
 
05:12:37.510 --> 05:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's this or something else um
 
05:12:38.550 --> 05:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
so i don't
 
05:12:40.830 --> 05:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
05:12:43.350 --> 05:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
um i think we're looking towards what
 
05:12:45.110 --> 05:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
the true value is and that might be very
 
05:12:49.030 --> 05:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
hard to to determine okay thank you
 
05:12:51.590 --> 05:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
05:12:57.030 --> 05:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative tripp i mean liseles
 
05:12:59.990 --> 05:13:00.000 align:start position:0%

05:13:05.990 --> 05:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:11.110 --> 05:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
one of the the most important websites
 
05:13:15.190 --> 05:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
that you go to if you're looking to rent
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
or buy a property
 
05:13:20.070 --> 05:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
in coast county
 
05:13:21.990 --> 05:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
is craigslist
 
05:13:22.000 --> 05:13:23.510 align:start position:0%

if you go to craigslist
 
05:13:28.310 --> 05:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
05:13:32.230 --> 05:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
that if you are right on a
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
atv trail or a snowmobile trail that is
 
05:13:38.868 --> 05:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
a very positive thing
 
05:13:41.430 --> 05:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
in marketing your property would you
 
05:13:42.948 --> 05:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
05:13:44.550 --> 05:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
i would believe it i have no experience
 
05:13:48.310 --> 05:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:50.948 --> 05:13:50.958 align:start position:0%

you
 
05:16:03.110 --> 05:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
i have been a permitted new hampshire
 
05:16:05.270 --> 05:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
permitted septic designer for more than
 
05:16:07.190 --> 05:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
30 years
 
05:16:09.110 --> 05:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
i have done hundreds and hundreds of
 
05:16:11.350 --> 05:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
designs my sons have followed me and
 
05:16:13.350 --> 05:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
worked with me in the trade
 
05:16:15.670 --> 05:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
and there are years that we produce over
 
05:16:18.470 --> 05:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
15 percent to 20 of all the septic
 
05:16:22.150 --> 05:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
designs generated in carroll county
 
05:16:24.150 --> 05:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
part of the process to become permitted
 
05:16:25.590 --> 05:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
05:16:27.270 --> 05:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
is that you need to
 
05:16:29.830 --> 05:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
pass two parts of a testing protocol
 
05:16:31.110 --> 05:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
with them
 
05:16:33.830 --> 05:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
one is a knowledge of the environmental
 
05:16:37.270 --> 05:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
rules that pertain to sewage disposal
 
05:16:39.350 --> 05:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
and the second and most important is
 
05:16:42.150 --> 05:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
that you have to pass a competency
 
05:16:45.350 --> 05:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
in evaluating soil the most important
 
05:16:48.470 --> 05:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
component of our of our industry
 
05:16:50.708 --> 05:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
is being able to judge where the
 
05:16:53.430 --> 05:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
seasonal high water adjusts to over a
 
05:16:55.350 --> 05:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
period of 20 years
 
05:16:57.990 --> 05:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
when i started in on this practice 30
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
plus years ago
 
05:17:01.590 --> 05:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
it was pretty standard we were using
 
05:17:03.750 --> 05:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
stone and pipe and that all systems
 
05:17:06.150 --> 05:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
would be built four feet above that
 
05:17:06.160 --> 05:17:07.270 align:start position:0%
would be built four feet above that
height

05:17:07.270 --> 05:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
height
 
05:17:07.280 --> 05:17:08.470 align:start position:0%
height
the

05:17:08.470 --> 05:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:08.480 --> 05:17:09.270 align:start position:0%
the
the

05:17:09.270 --> 05:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:11.350 --> 05:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
if you would provide at least two feet
 
05:17:14.310 --> 05:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
of great soil underneath that system
 
05:17:16.150 --> 05:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
there were some that claim you could put
 
05:17:17.830 --> 05:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
a cup of water underneath it and you
 
05:17:19.910 --> 05:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
could drink that that effluent as it
 
05:17:21.990 --> 05:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
comes through i have never done that
 
05:17:24.628 --> 05:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
i've never suggested anyone do that
 
05:17:27.270 --> 05:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
technology marches forward
 
05:17:29.830 --> 05:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
like it does in every other industry in
 
05:17:33.030 --> 05:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
a majority of the systems that many many
 
05:17:35.190 --> 05:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
of the systems now
 
05:17:37.830 --> 05:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
have gone from stone and pipe to enviro
 
05:17:40.310 --> 05:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
to elgins to all these other
 
05:17:42.150 --> 05:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
innovative systems
 
05:17:44.390 --> 05:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
that instead of needing to be four feet
 
05:17:46.948 --> 05:17:46.958 align:start position:0%
above seasonal high water you only need
 
05:17:50.390 --> 05:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
to be two foot above seasonal high water
 
05:17:53.190 --> 05:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
the margin of error of a layman figuring
 
05:17:55.670 --> 05:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
out where that mark was
 
05:17:58.390 --> 05:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
just became extremely important because
 
05:18:00.628 --> 05:18:00.638 align:start position:0%
if they missed that mark and they're
 
05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
less than two feet above that seasonal
 
05:18:04.788 --> 05:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
height of
 
05:18:04.798 --> 05:18:05.990 align:start position:0%
height of
water

05:18:05.990 --> 05:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
water
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
then we're shedding untreated effluent
 
05:18:10.550 --> 05:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
into the groundwater
 
05:18:12.948 --> 05:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
the department had asked me to bring
 
05:18:14.948 --> 05:18:14.958 align:start position:0%
this forward on their behalf
 
05:18:17.350 --> 05:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
i understand the issue
 
05:18:19.510 --> 05:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions i know
 
05:18:22.550 --> 05:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
the department is here to answer further
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
for you also
 
05:18:28.708 --> 05:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:31.030 --> 05:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
05:18:32.470 --> 05:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:18:34.628 --> 05:18:34.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to
 
05:18:39.030 --> 05:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
formulate the question in my mind um
 
05:18:41.270 --> 05:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at the language
 
05:18:43.110 --> 05:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
so i'll just i can't i can't say the
 
05:18:44.628 --> 05:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
word that i'm looking for but my
 
05:18:44.638 --> 05:18:45.910 align:start position:0%
word that i'm looking for but my
question

05:18:45.910 --> 05:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:18:48.070 --> 05:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
pertains to
 
05:18:51.110 --> 05:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
this septic design being approved
 
05:18:55.350 --> 05:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
so currently a homeowner can in fact
 
05:18:57.510 --> 05:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
make the app do the design and make the
 
05:19:00.310 --> 05:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
application is it not true that
 
05:19:00.320 --> 05:19:03.910 align:start position:0%
application is it not true that
regardless

05:19:03.910 --> 05:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:06.470 --> 05:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's a licensed septic designer
 
05:19:09.750 --> 05:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
or a homeowner do both applicants that
 
05:19:12.708 --> 05:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
must their designs be approved
 
05:19:16.070 --> 05:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
by another another agency
 
05:19:18.230 --> 05:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
designs must be are reviewed and
 
05:19:20.550 --> 05:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
approved by the department
 
05:19:22.868 --> 05:19:22.878 align:start position:0%
and the department is taking on face
 
05:19:22.878 --> 05:19:24.070 align:start position:0%
and the department is taking on face
value

05:19:24.070 --> 05:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
value
 
05:19:26.708 --> 05:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
uh that the person that has submitted
 
05:19:29.910 --> 05:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
this is knowledgeable enough to know
 
05:19:42.310 --> 05:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:42.320 --> 05:19:43.350 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:19:43.350 --> 05:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:19:45.030 --> 05:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
so in either case
 
05:19:45.040 --> 05:19:47.910 align:start position:0%
so in either case
um

05:19:47.910 --> 05:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:49.830 --> 05:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
or the case of the homeowner that their
 
05:19:49.840 --> 05:19:50.948 align:start position:0%
or the case of the homeowner that their
design

05:19:50.948 --> 05:19:50.958 align:start position:0%
design
 
05:19:55.190 --> 05:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:57.510 --> 05:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for the question um the
 
05:20:00.230 --> 05:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
department reviews the design it has to
 
05:20:02.470 --> 05:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
be designed the difference is
 
05:20:04.788 --> 05:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
when the department reviews a design
 
05:20:06.948 --> 05:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
done by myself or my boys or other
 
05:20:08.628 --> 05:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
licensed people
 
05:20:10.948 --> 05:20:10.958 align:start position:0%
they know the quality of our work and
 
05:20:13.030 --> 05:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
we've been tested to know that we know
 
05:20:14.708 --> 05:20:14.718 align:start position:0%
what's in the soil
 
05:20:17.750 --> 05:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
when the department gets a homeowners
 
05:20:17.760 --> 05:20:19.030 align:start position:0%
when the department gets a homeowners
and

05:20:19.030 --> 05:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:20:21.030 --> 05:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
design before them
 
05:20:23.190 --> 05:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
they the department doesn't have that
 
05:20:25.030 --> 05:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
same certainty of what they're looking
 
05:20:25.040 --> 05:20:30.868 align:start position:0%
same certainty of what they're looking
at

05:20:30.868 --> 05:20:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:32.470 --> 05:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair
 
05:20:35.030 --> 05:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so what the concern is from
 
05:20:38.070 --> 05:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
your standpoint is the integrity or or
 
05:20:38.080 --> 05:20:39.350 align:start position:0%
your standpoint is the integrity or or
the

05:20:39.350 --> 05:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:20:41.590 --> 05:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
integrity of the septic design
 
05:20:44.788 --> 05:20:44.798 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that the homeowner
 
05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
may or may not and most likely not be a
 
05:20:49.990 --> 05:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
licensed septic designer and so
 
05:20:50.000 --> 05:20:51.270 align:start position:0%
licensed septic designer and so
therefore

05:20:51.270 --> 05:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
05:20:53.270 --> 05:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
the evaluation
 
05:20:56.310 --> 05:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
to approve this design is not you're not
 
05:20:59.110 --> 05:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
checking every single jot and tittle of
 
05:21:02.070 --> 05:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
the design is that the concern thank you
 
05:21:03.270 --> 05:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think it
 
05:21:07.990 --> 05:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:09.910 --> 05:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
05:21:09.920 --> 05:21:11.110 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
ron

05:21:11.110 --> 05:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
ron
 
05:21:12.628 --> 05:21:12.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:21:16.310 --> 05:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:17.830 --> 05:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
is this
 
05:21:20.070 --> 05:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
is the current rsa applicable to all
 
05:21:23.110 --> 05:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
septic systems or or septic systems that
 
05:21:24.948 --> 05:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
may be near
 
05:21:28.230 --> 05:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
vulnerable locations shorelines wetlands
 
05:21:28.240 --> 05:21:29.670 align:start position:0%
vulnerable locations shorelines wetlands
whatever

05:21:29.670 --> 05:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
05:21:31.590 --> 05:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
are they held to a higher standard or is
 
05:21:34.470 --> 05:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
this does this apply to all of them
 
05:21:37.670 --> 05:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
the nature of my question comes is that
 
05:21:41.670 --> 05:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if by restricting septic
 
05:21:43.910 --> 05:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
designs to just the professional
 
05:21:46.150 --> 05:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
engineers such as yourself rather than
 
05:21:50.628 --> 05:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:53.270 --> 05:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
we may be able to address
 
05:21:54.948 --> 05:21:54.958 align:start position:0%
threats to
 
05:21:54.958 --> 05:21:55.830 align:start position:0%
threats to
very

05:21:55.830 --> 05:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:21:59.350 --> 05:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
sensitive environmental locations
 
05:22:00.310 --> 05:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:22:02.708 --> 05:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
for the question i'm pondering
 
05:22:04.548 --> 05:22:04.558 align:start position:0%
your question so
 
05:22:04.558 --> 05:22:07.270 align:start position:0%
your question so
um

05:22:07.270 --> 05:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:10.708 --> 05:22:10.718 align:start position:0%
being accurate becomes uh even
 
05:22:13.270 --> 05:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
more important the closer you become to
 
05:22:15.510 --> 05:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
a valuable resource
 
05:22:18.310 --> 05:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
a river and so forth and
 
05:22:18.320 --> 05:22:20.150 align:start position:0%
a river and so forth and
wetlands

05:22:20.150 --> 05:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
wetlands
 
05:22:24.788 --> 05:22:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:24.798 --> 05:22:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
i

05:22:25.670 --> 05:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:22:27.910 --> 05:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think i don't think if the
 
05:22:30.548 --> 05:22:30.558 align:start position:0%
question was should the bill be broken
 
05:22:33.670 --> 05:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
for certain locations
 
05:22:36.708 --> 05:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
i don't think so
 
05:22:39.750 --> 05:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
you had characterized designers as
 
05:22:39.760 --> 05:22:41.670 align:start position:0%
you had characterized designers as
engineers

05:22:41.670 --> 05:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
engineers
 
05:22:43.430 --> 05:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
i just want to make the point that a lot
 
05:22:47.350 --> 05:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
of us are laymen we're contractors we're
 
05:22:48.788 --> 05:22:48.798 align:start position:0%
not engineers you're going to have the
 
05:22:51.030 --> 05:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
pleasure hearing from an engineer after
 
05:22:53.510 --> 05:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
but we're we are trained in the field
 
05:22:55.190 --> 05:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
and we have to
 
05:22:57.510 --> 05:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
we have to know soil we have to know
 
05:22:59.590 --> 05:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
wetlands we have to draw those
 
05:22:59.600 --> 05:23:00.788 align:start position:0%
wetlands we have to draw those
boundaries

05:23:00.788 --> 05:23:00.798 align:start position:0%
boundaries
 
05:23:04.150 --> 05:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
and for the purposes of a septic design
 
05:23:07.590 --> 05:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
we are permitted to go in and put those
 
05:23:10.310 --> 05:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
boundary lines on our plan
 
05:23:13.270 --> 05:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
so and once again if if you're if you're
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
a layman by being a homeowner i don't
 
05:23:19.270 --> 05:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
know that you have that level and would
 
05:23:21.670 --> 05:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
know enough to say for instance
 
05:23:23.990 --> 05:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
to pull yourself 50 feet from what they
 
05:23:27.190 --> 05:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
call a hydric soil or 75 feet from a
 
05:23:29.110 --> 05:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
poorly drained so
 
05:23:31.510 --> 05:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
your question's valuable and
 
05:23:34.868 --> 05:23:34.878 align:start position:0%
i i hope i answered what you want
 
05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:36.240 --> 05:23:38.310 align:start position:0%
thank you
question

05:23:38.310 --> 05:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:23:39.750 --> 05:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
who did you say you brought with you
 
05:23:42.548 --> 05:23:42.558 align:start position:0%
from the environmental services
 
05:23:45.190 --> 05:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
behind me is uh rob tardif from who's
 
05:23:47.910 --> 05:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
the subsurface administrator
 
05:23:49.830 --> 05:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
and i believe
 
05:23:51.430 --> 05:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with the other

delivered to the committee from them i
 
05:24:09.990 --> 05:24:10.000 align:start position:0%

hello again i was here earlier this
 
05:24:46.470 --> 05:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
morning uh
 
05:24:48.070 --> 05:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you again for letting me testify
 
05:24:51.510 --> 05:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
and and this time house bill 1293 again
 
05:24:53.670 --> 05:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
my name is rob tardiff
 
05:24:55.270 --> 05:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
i'm the administrator of the subsurface
 
05:24:56.788 --> 05:24:56.798 align:start position:0%
systems bureau within the department of
 
05:24:59.430 --> 05:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
05:25:01.190 --> 05:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
just briefly the subsurface systems
 
05:25:04.628 --> 05:25:04.638 align:start position:0%
bureau regulates all on-site wastewater
 
05:25:06.788 --> 05:25:06.798 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
05:25:09.350 --> 05:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it's residential
 
05:25:10.788 --> 05:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
or commercial
 
05:25:12.310 --> 05:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
we also do
 
05:25:13.910 --> 05:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
subdivision of land
 
05:25:13.920 --> 05:25:15.270 align:start position:0%
subdivision of land
and

05:25:15.270 --> 05:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:19.030 --> 05:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
relative to 1293 we permit or license
 
05:25:21.270 --> 05:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
they're kind of synonymous here
 
05:25:23.430 --> 05:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
all septic system designers and
 
05:25:26.470 --> 05:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
installers in the state
 
05:25:29.030 --> 05:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
other than for a person's own domicile
 
05:25:31.030 --> 05:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
you must be a permanent designer or
 
05:25:37.430 --> 05:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:40.230 --> 05:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
right now we have approximately
 
05:25:42.390 --> 05:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
680 active
 
05:25:44.150 --> 05:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
designers in the state
 
05:25:47.590 --> 05:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
and about 1500 active installers
 
05:25:50.070 --> 05:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
as representative mcconkey pointed out
 
05:25:51.910 --> 05:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
each one of those
 
05:25:54.708 --> 05:25:54.718 align:start position:0%
professionals have had to pass a state
 
05:25:54.718 --> 05:25:55.670 align:start position:0%
professionals have had to pass a state
exam

05:25:55.670 --> 05:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
exam
 
05:25:57.590 --> 05:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
and that that exam demonstrates their
 
05:25:58.830 --> 05:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge of
 
05:26:01.030 --> 05:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
soils and their relation the
 
05:26:02.788 --> 05:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
relationship of soils in the seasonal
 
05:26:04.230 --> 05:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
high water table
 
05:26:05.510 --> 05:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
i don't necessarily think i need to
 
05:26:07.190 --> 05:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
repeat a lot of what representative
 
05:26:10.070 --> 05:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
mcconkey said i'd be happy to go over it
 
05:26:12.788 --> 05:26:12.798 align:start position:0%
uh but in an effort to save everybody's
 
05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
time here you field a few questions
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
of course
 
05:26:18.230 --> 05:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
05:26:19.590 --> 05:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:26:21.030 --> 05:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:26:23.270 --> 05:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
so could you explain to to us what
 
05:26:26.230 --> 05:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
happens when you receive a
 
05:26:30.708 --> 05:26:30.718 align:start position:0%
a a septic design plan that's very poor
 
05:26:33.670 --> 05:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
and and just not adequate what is the
 
05:26:36.230 --> 05:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
process is it just is it denied
 
05:26:39.190 --> 05:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
or does the department have to assist
 
05:26:39.200 --> 05:26:40.150 align:start position:0%
or does the department have to assist
and

05:26:40.150 --> 05:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:26:40.160 --> 05:26:41.190 align:start position:0%
and
lead

05:26:41.190 --> 05:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
lead
 
05:26:44.150 --> 05:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
the the homeowner
 
05:26:46.470 --> 05:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
into correcting the design mistakes what
 
05:26:48.070 --> 05:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
does that process look like how much
 
05:26:50.150 --> 05:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
time does that take in the resources
 
05:26:53.030 --> 05:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
from your department
 
05:26:54.948 --> 05:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh every
 
05:26:57.030 --> 05:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
application is reviewed again if there
 
05:26:59.190 --> 05:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
are any deficiencies noted during that
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
review we issue what's called a request
 
05:27:03.590 --> 05:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
for more information letter in that
 
05:27:05.750 --> 05:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
letter it describes it itemizes all of
 
05:27:07.670 --> 05:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
the deficiencies that we found with the
 
05:27:07.680 --> 05:27:09.350 align:start position:0%
the deficiencies that we found with the
application

05:27:09.350 --> 05:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
application
 
05:27:09.360 --> 05:27:10.628 align:start position:0%
application
hopefully

05:27:10.628 --> 05:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
05:27:12.548 --> 05:27:12.558 align:start position:0%
when the applicant or the designer or
 
05:27:14.708 --> 05:27:14.718 align:start position:0%
the homeowner in this case receives that
 
05:27:17.830 --> 05:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
letter they can correct the deficiencies
 
05:27:19.990 --> 05:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
resubmit the application to us or at
 
05:27:21.590 --> 05:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
least resubmit
 
05:27:23.510 --> 05:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
the information that we've requested in
 
05:27:25.510 --> 05:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
our letter
 
05:27:27.030 --> 05:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
and then we
 
05:27:29.110 --> 05:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
in time will be able to issue the
 
05:27:31.750 --> 05:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
approval unfortunately with the
 
05:27:34.070 --> 05:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
homeowner designs that request for
 
05:27:36.948 --> 05:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
information process goes back and forth
 
05:27:39.590 --> 05:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
many many more times than it would for a
 
05:27:41.110 --> 05:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
permanent designer like representative
 
05:27:43.270 --> 05:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
mcconkey which takes a significant
 
05:27:46.708 --> 05:27:46.718 align:start position:0%
amount more a significant more amount of
 
05:27:48.948 --> 05:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
staff resources
 
05:27:51.110 --> 05:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:27:52.708 --> 05:27:52.718 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions thank you
 
05:27:56.470 --> 05:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:58.470 --> 05:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:28:00.548 --> 05:28:00.558 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
05:28:00.558 --> 05:28:01.910 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
uh

05:28:01.910 --> 05:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:28:03.110 --> 05:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
when i first
 
05:28:04.708 --> 05:28:04.718 align:start position:0%
reviewed this bill
 
05:28:06.628 --> 05:28:06.638 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that struck my eye
 
05:28:09.110 --> 05:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
was that
 
05:28:12.230 --> 05:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
the person that developed their own plan
 
05:28:13.830 --> 05:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
had to
 
05:28:15.590 --> 05:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
provide that
 
05:28:15.600 --> 05:28:18.628 align:start position:0%
provide that
they

05:28:18.628 --> 05:28:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:21.030 --> 05:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
meet the eligibility for this exemption
 
05:28:23.350 --> 05:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
what kind of process is there for
 
05:28:26.948 --> 05:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:31.030 --> 05:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:32.150 --> 05:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question i'm sorry
 
05:28:33.990 --> 05:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
that this the speaker is right in
 
05:28:36.230 --> 05:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
between us here um
 
05:28:37.990 --> 05:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
that that can be interpreted a number of
 
05:28:40.788 --> 05:28:40.798 align:start position:0%
different ways one is the eligibility or
 
05:28:42.070 --> 05:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
the knowledge
 
05:28:44.150 --> 05:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
that we would like to have from people
 
05:28:46.230 --> 05:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
submitting applications relative to
 
05:28:49.510 --> 05:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
soils groundwater
 
05:28:51.910 --> 05:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
just all our rules our design rules but
 
05:28:54.150 --> 05:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
it could also be interpreted as just the
 
05:28:56.230 --> 05:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility of
 
05:28:58.470 --> 05:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
that you actually live in the property
 
05:29:01.510 --> 05:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
you're considering your domicile
 
05:29:04.470 --> 05:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
so again that could be considered in in
 
05:29:06.150 --> 05:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
two different ways
 
05:29:07.990 --> 05:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
if i've answered your question
 
05:29:09.510 --> 05:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
we would like we would like to be able
 
05:29:11.350 --> 05:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
to say you have to demonstrate your
 
05:29:11.360 --> 05:29:13.510 align:start position:0%
to say you have to demonstrate your
eligibility

05:29:13.510 --> 05:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
05:29:15.430 --> 05:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
through knowledge of
 
05:29:17.350 --> 05:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
i know i'm sorry of
 
05:29:20.708 --> 05:29:20.718 align:start position:0%
of soils and season in the groundwater
 
05:29:20.718 --> 05:29:23.430 align:start position:0%
of soils and season in the groundwater
representative

05:29:23.430 --> 05:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:26.150 --> 05:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:29:27.590 --> 05:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:29:30.628 --> 05:29:30.638 align:start position:0%
so um my question is
 
05:29:32.708 --> 05:29:32.718 align:start position:0%
only for
 
05:29:34.788 --> 05:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
the do it yourself
 
05:29:37.830 --> 05:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
folks that this is needed are there
 
05:29:39.670 --> 05:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
other categories of
 
05:29:41.750 --> 05:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
septic design and source
 
05:29:41.760 --> 05:29:42.868 align:start position:0%

05:29:47.590 --> 05:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
design and uh implementation
 
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is and i'm hoping i'm
 
05:29:51.430 --> 05:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
answering your question but this bill is
 
05:29:54.070 --> 05:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
specific to homeowner designs for their
 
05:29:56.628 --> 05:29:56.638 align:start position:0%
domicile let's do it yourself correct
 
05:29:59.030 --> 05:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
kind of uh so are there other categories
 
05:30:01.110 --> 05:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
is my question what other categories are
 
05:30:01.120 --> 05:30:02.150 align:start position:0%
is my question what other categories are
there

05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%

05:30:05.110 --> 05:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
homeowners small businesses commercial
 
05:30:06.390 --> 05:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
large scale
 
05:30:09.350 --> 05:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
well we have residential systems and
 
05:30:11.350 --> 05:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
commercial systems but i don't know if i
 
05:30:12.868 --> 05:30:12.878 align:start position:0%
would consider them necessarily
 
05:30:15.590 --> 05:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
different categories relative to design
 
05:30:17.270 --> 05:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you we have we have different
 
05:30:18.868 --> 05:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
design flows that have to be taken to
 
05:30:18.878 --> 05:30:20.070 align:start position:0%
design flows that have to be taken to
account

05:30:20.070 --> 05:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
account
 
05:30:22.470 --> 05:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
to create the
 
05:30:25.270 --> 05:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate design representative
 
05:30:26.628 --> 05:30:26.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:30:29.030 --> 05:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
taking my um subsequent question so to
 
05:30:31.830 --> 05:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
be very clear with regard to the
 
05:30:35.830 --> 05:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
the the concept of diy
 
05:30:38.628 --> 05:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
a licensed contractor or septic
 
05:30:38.638 --> 05:30:40.230 align:start position:0%
a licensed contractor or septic
installer

05:30:40.230 --> 05:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
installer
 
05:30:41.910 --> 05:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
would be the only
 
05:30:41.920 --> 05:30:43.030 align:start position:0%
would be the only
parties

05:30:43.030 --> 05:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
parties
 
05:30:45.910 --> 05:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
permitted to actually install
 
05:30:48.150 --> 05:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
such a design
 
05:30:50.470 --> 05:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's correct there's a very similar
 
05:30:53.670 --> 05:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
statutory provision in rsa45836
 
05:30:53.680 --> 05:30:54.788 align:start position:0%
statutory provision in rsa45836
where

05:30:54.788 --> 05:30:54.798 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:30:56.470 --> 05:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
the statutory provision we're talking
 
05:30:58.190 --> 05:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
about about design is in
 
05:31:00.548 --> 05:31:00.558 align:start position:0%
rsa45835 but there's a very similar
 
05:31:02.470 --> 05:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
provision in 36 for homeowner
 
05:31:02.480 --> 05:31:07.510 align:start position:0%
provision in 36 for homeowner
installation

05:31:07.510 --> 05:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:08.788 --> 05:31:08.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:31:10.548 --> 05:31:10.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:31:12.868 --> 05:31:12.878 align:start position:0%
i've replaced a couple septic systems in
 
05:31:14.390 --> 05:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
my life and
 
05:31:16.628 --> 05:31:16.638 align:start position:0%
aside from calling up the company and
 
05:31:19.190 --> 05:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
writing a very large check
 
05:31:21.670 --> 05:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
i really haven't been involved except i
 
05:31:22.948 --> 05:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
did notice
 
05:31:24.708 --> 05:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
i think during both of those installs
 
05:31:26.788 --> 05:31:26.798 align:start position:0%
that somebody inspected i think with
 
05:31:28.708 --> 05:31:28.718 align:start position:0%
somebody from the town
 
05:31:31.750 --> 05:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
is is that inspection a common practice
 
05:31:33.990 --> 05:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and
 
05:31:35.910 --> 05:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
how would would that be impacted at all
 
05:31:37.590 --> 05:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
by this bill
 
05:31:39.510 --> 05:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
the inspection of the construction of
 
05:31:41.110 --> 05:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
the system would not be impacted by the
 
05:31:42.548 --> 05:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
belt but if i could back up a little bit
 
05:31:44.070 --> 05:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
on your question
 
05:31:46.070 --> 05:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
the bureau kind of has two
 
05:31:48.310 --> 05:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
functions relative to septic systems and
 
05:31:51.270 --> 05:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
that is we review every design before
 
05:31:52.628 --> 05:31:52.638 align:start position:0%
it's approved
 
05:31:54.390 --> 05:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
and then we inspect the other part of
 
05:31:54.400 --> 05:31:55.270 align:start position:0%
and then we inspect the other part of
our

05:31:55.270 --> 05:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:31:57.510 --> 05:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
bureau and specs every system before
 
05:31:59.350 --> 05:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
it's placed into operation
 
05:32:01.190 --> 05:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
if i could you take just a minute
 
05:32:02.948 --> 05:32:02.958 align:start position:0%
my analogy is kind of when you build a
 
05:32:06.390 --> 05:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
house you get a building permit when you
 
05:32:08.390 --> 05:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
build a house that's essentially our
 
05:32:10.628 --> 05:32:10.638 align:start position:0%
approval for construction we approve the
 
05:32:10.638 --> 05:32:12.230 align:start position:0%
approval for construction we approve the
plans

05:32:12.230 --> 05:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
plans
 
05:32:14.628 --> 05:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
and then on the again the house side you
 
05:32:17.190 --> 05:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
get a certificate of occupancy right
 
05:32:19.830 --> 05:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
that the town guy comes in or the town
 
05:32:22.788 --> 05:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
person comes in inspects the house and
 
05:32:25.430 --> 05:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
issues you a certificate of occupancy
 
05:32:26.390 --> 05:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
in our
 
05:32:29.030 --> 05:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
in our world we inspect every system and
 
05:32:30.548 --> 05:32:30.558 align:start position:0%
we issue what's called an approval for
 
05:32:30.558 --> 05:32:31.670 align:start position:0%
we issue what's called an approval for
operation

05:32:31.670 --> 05:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
operation
 
05:32:33.590 --> 05:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
so you have an approval for construction
 
05:32:35.910 --> 05:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
we do an inspection we grant an approval
 
05:32:37.990 --> 05:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
for operation
 
05:32:39.670 --> 05:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr tardiff
 
05:32:41.030 --> 05:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
if i could just say if i could just add
 
05:32:43.270 --> 05:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
one more thing very briefly
 
05:32:45.190 --> 05:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
to your question about
 
05:32:46.948 --> 05:32:46.958 align:start position:0%
sensitive areas
 
05:32:48.150 --> 05:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
i would
 
05:32:49.910 --> 05:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
like to say that we think that every
 
05:32:51.350 --> 05:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
area is sensitive because we're really
 
05:32:53.590 --> 05:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
protecting groundwater
 
05:32:55.750 --> 05:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
i.e drinking water
 
05:32:57.910 --> 05:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
so it's not just sensitive areas as far
 
05:33:01.190 --> 05:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
as surface water goes or wetlands goes
 
05:33:02.948 --> 05:33:02.958 align:start position:0%
so we feel that this should be a
 
05:33:02.958 --> 05:33:05.910 align:start position:0%
so we feel that this should be a
statewide

05:33:05.910 --> 05:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:07.750 --> 05:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr turtle you've helped
 
05:33:10.310 --> 05:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
educate representative band
 
05:33:12.310 --> 05:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you mr
 
05:33:14.628 --> 05:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
tardif uh am i
 
05:33:17.430 --> 05:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
am i correct in assuming that the issue
 
05:33:19.190 --> 05:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to address here is not
 
05:33:21.270 --> 05:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
so much the design of the system since
 
05:33:23.270 --> 05:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
you have to inspect that anyway but you
 
05:33:25.430 --> 05:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
inspect it as a design on a piece of
 
05:33:28.470 --> 05:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
paper the issue is is the system going
 
05:33:31.510 --> 05:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
to be situated appropriately vis-a-vis
 
05:33:32.708 --> 05:33:32.718 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:33:34.310 --> 05:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
high-water mark
 
05:33:36.948 --> 05:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
is that what we're trying to fix here
 
05:33:39.110 --> 05:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
that's part of it but i mean that's
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's the vertical extent that we're
 
05:33:42.788 --> 05:33:42.798 align:start position:0%
talking about as far as the design goes
 
05:33:44.548 --> 05:33:44.558 align:start position:0%
there's also horizontal setbacks to
 
05:33:46.868 --> 05:33:46.878 align:start position:0%
wells to right again wetlands surface
 
05:33:46.878 --> 05:33:47.990 align:start position:0%
wells to right again wetlands surface
waters

05:33:47.990 --> 05:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
waters
 
05:33:49.990 --> 05:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
but your follow-up please you're
 
05:33:52.470 --> 05:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
depending on the design to
 
05:33:52.480 --> 05:33:53.670 align:start position:0%
depending on the design to
correctly

05:33:53.670 --> 05:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
05:33:56.070 --> 05:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
identify what the mean high water line
 
05:33:58.788 --> 05:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
is and where those other
 
05:34:00.948 --> 05:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
things the the horizontal issues about
 
05:34:02.708 --> 05:34:02.718 align:start position:0%
the well you're depending on the
 
05:34:04.548 --> 05:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
designer to have told you the right
 
05:34:07.270 --> 05:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
thing there that's correct so this is in
 
05:34:09.510 --> 05:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
an effort to make sure that that person
 
05:34:11.270 --> 05:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
actually knows what they're doing
 
05:34:13.270 --> 05:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay thank you
 
05:34:15.510 --> 05:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you mr tardiff i appreciate
 
05:34:15.520 --> 05:34:16.310 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you mr tardiff i appreciate
it

05:34:16.310 --> 05:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:34:17.750 --> 05:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you much for you very much for
 
05:34:19.110 --> 05:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
your time
 
05:34:21.190 --> 05:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
we've learned something today
 
05:34:24.708 --> 05:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing i hope so thank you
 
05:34:36.830 --> 05:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:36.840 --> 05:34:38.628 align:start position:0%

association it's a new name we've
 
05:35:31.910 --> 05:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
rebranded used to be gsti we're the

05:35:40.390 --> 05:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
we're in support of this bill we
 
05:35:43.590 --> 05:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
understand the situation that des has
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
with homeowner designs i know we live in
 
05:35:49.270 --> 05:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire our home is our castle
 
05:35:51.590 --> 05:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
but you know deciding a seasonal water
 
05:35:54.628 --> 05:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
table is a science uh i have a four year
 
05:35:57.590 --> 05:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
degree from unh a minor in soils i'm a
 
05:35:59.910 --> 05:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
wetland scientist and evaluator designer
 
05:36:02.310 --> 05:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
i put a lot of training into
 
05:36:04.310 --> 05:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
understanding a water table i'm actually
 
05:36:06.628 --> 05:36:06.638 align:start position:0%
an instructor at the university of new
 
05:36:08.628 --> 05:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire teaching continuing education
 
05:36:10.070 --> 05:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
on soils
 
05:36:12.150 --> 05:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
the soils are the key under doing a
 
05:36:15.030 --> 05:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
proper design if that's not done right
 
05:36:16.470 --> 05:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
again we could have
 
05:36:18.948 --> 05:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
failures to our groundwater our water
 
05:36:21.830 --> 05:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
supplies and our wetlands so it again
 
05:36:24.070 --> 05:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's i understand that the situation of
 
05:36:26.070 --> 05:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
maybe sensitive areas
 
05:36:28.390 --> 05:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
the problem with that concept is des is
 
05:36:30.470 --> 05:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
only getting a small snapshot
 
05:36:32.150 --> 05:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
of a plan they're not getting a giant
 
05:36:34.548 --> 05:36:34.558 align:start position:0%
locust map that knows what's going on
 
05:36:37.590 --> 05:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
maybe 500 feet away of a of a lake
 
05:36:40.150 --> 05:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
perspective so again this should be a
 
05:36:41.910 --> 05:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
broad-based uh bill the way it's
 
05:36:41.920 --> 05:36:43.190 align:start position:0%
broad-based uh bill the way it's
presented

05:36:43.190 --> 05:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
presented
 
05:36:45.510 --> 05:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
allowing uh or not allowing any more
 
05:36:47.270 --> 05:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
home or designs
 
05:36:49.350 --> 05:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
do you have any more handouts
 
05:36:54.390 --> 05:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:58.868 --> 05:36:58.878 align:start position:0%
oh i split half and half but yep
 
05:37:00.708 --> 05:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
oh i think representative los alas ate
 
05:37:08.788 --> 05:37:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:10.628 --> 05:37:10.638 align:start position:0%
again i'll leave leave the letter for
 
05:37:12.310 --> 05:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
the uh the committee to read at their
 
05:37:14.708 --> 05:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
leisure but again it's the seasonal
 
05:37:17.750 --> 05:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
water table is the key component of what
 
05:37:20.150 --> 05:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
the homeowner's issues are mr republican
 
05:37:20.160 --> 05:37:20.868 align:start position:0%
the homeowner's issues are mr republican
uh

05:37:20.868 --> 05:37:20.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:37:23.430 --> 05:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
mcconkey and mr tardif kind of outlined
 
05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
those aspects and again we just want to
 
05:37:27.270 --> 05:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
reiterate uh you know our board of
 
05:37:29.510 --> 05:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
directors we we actually discussed this
 
05:37:31.990 --> 05:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
at length and i had you know the support
 
05:37:33.830 --> 05:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
of all the board members
 
05:37:36.070 --> 05:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh for the passage on this bill very
 
05:37:37.750 --> 05:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
good thank you for your testimony and we
 
05:37:40.788 --> 05:37:40.798 align:start position:0%
have one more question thank you mr
 
05:37:42.070 --> 05:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:37:45.110 --> 05:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
question are you aware of any um
 
05:37:48.868 --> 05:37:48.878 align:start position:0%
such septic designs that that have been
 
05:37:51.910 --> 05:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
installed and have failed and have have
 
05:37:54.390 --> 05:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
caused damage to the environment or
 
05:37:55.750 --> 05:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
other um
 
05:37:57.510 --> 05:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:38:00.070 --> 05:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
consequences as a result of a faulty
 
05:38:00.080 --> 05:38:01.190 align:start position:0%
consequences as a result of a faulty
design

05:38:01.190 --> 05:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
design
 
05:38:03.350 --> 05:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
every day unfortunately yeah i mean it's
 
05:38:05.510 --> 05:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's you know we're seeing failures
 
05:38:08.150 --> 05:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
all the time now of even the designers
 
05:38:10.150 --> 05:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
not understanding a good concept of the
 
05:38:11.830 --> 05:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
water table so it's it's a learning
 
05:38:13.430 --> 05:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
process that's why we're always
 
05:38:15.990 --> 05:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
continuously teaching it
 
05:38:18.070 --> 05:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
failures on a leech field are pretty
 
05:38:20.548 --> 05:38:20.558 align:start position:0%
isolated to that general area
 
05:38:22.390 --> 05:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
but they have been known to break out in
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
the lakes i mean we have algae blooms
 
05:38:26.948 --> 05:38:26.958 align:start position:0%
and our our cyanobacteria hits in our
 
05:38:29.510 --> 05:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
lakes uh we're a non-point source
 
05:38:31.750 --> 05:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
issue with our septic system so
 
05:38:33.990 --> 05:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
again there will be future bills or
 
05:38:36.470 --> 05:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
possibly bills this year about different
 
05:38:38.708 --> 05:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
types of restrictions on development
 
05:38:41.110 --> 05:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
along lakes but it is important
 
05:38:43.270 --> 05:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
we're part of the culprits for our
 
05:38:44.708 --> 05:38:44.718 align:start position:0%
our water quality that keeps new
 
05:38:48.390 --> 05:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:52.628 --> 05:38:52.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr abbott albert albert
 
05:38:52.638 --> 05:38:54.788 align:start position:0%
thank you mr abbott albert albert
representative

05:38:54.788 --> 05:38:54.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:38:56.788 --> 05:38:56.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:38:58.310 --> 05:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:38:59.910 --> 05:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
um how
 
05:39:02.948 --> 05:39:02.958 align:start position:0%
prevalent is the leeching and affecting
 
05:39:04.868 --> 05:39:04.878 align:start position:0%
the groundwater and drinking water
 
05:39:07.430 --> 05:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
through because of septic i i don't have
 
05:39:09.830 --> 05:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
any studies with me but there i was on a
 
05:39:12.150 --> 05:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
study through this this uh house last
 
05:39:14.628 --> 05:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
year uh it is prevalent i mean if you
 
05:39:16.948 --> 05:39:16.958 align:start position:0%
just look at your beach closures
 
05:39:18.150 --> 05:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
every year they're getting they're
 
05:39:19.990 --> 05:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
getting worse and worse
 
05:39:22.390 --> 05:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
and septic systems as a non-point source
 
05:39:24.070 --> 05:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
contaminant are are
 
05:39:26.070 --> 05:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
a culprit of that so again
 
05:39:27.990 --> 05:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
if things aren't done uh we're going to
 
05:39:30.548 --> 05:39:30.558 align:start position:0%
lose our lakes
 
05:39:30.558 --> 05:39:31.510 align:start position:0%
lose our lakes
okay

05:39:31.510 --> 05:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:39:33.350 --> 05:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
now thank you for your testimony
 
05:39:37.750 --> 05:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:39.030 --> 05:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
so that
 
05:39:46.948 --> 05:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:48.628 --> 05:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
and we're going to open the hearing on
 
05:39:48.638 --> 05:39:49.670 align:start position:0%
and we're going to open the hearing on
hb

05:39:49.670 --> 05:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
hb
 
05:39:49.680 --> 05:40:05.830 align:start position:0%
hb
1365.

05:40:05.830 --> 05:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:07.670 --> 05:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
05:40:12.310 --> 05:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:14.150 --> 05:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
my name is uh as most of you know
 
05:40:16.390 --> 05:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative max abramson uh now that
 
05:40:19.030 --> 05:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
i have lefloterial i'm i'm representing
 
05:40:21.270 --> 05:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
the towns of hampton hampton falls and
 
05:40:23.430 --> 05:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
seabrook and i'm introducing a bill that
 
05:40:23.440 --> 05:40:24.868 align:start position:0%
seabrook and i'm introducing a bill that
that

05:40:24.868 --> 05:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:40:26.948 --> 05:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
just asks the question or would simply
 
05:40:28.948 --> 05:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
provide the local option to allow towns
 
05:40:30.948 --> 05:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
to split from
 
05:40:33.190 --> 05:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
a one-word rate property tax to a
 
05:40:35.670 --> 05:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
two-rate property tax system one for
 
05:40:38.470 --> 05:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
residential and one for residential
 
05:40:38.480 --> 05:40:39.750 align:start position:0%
residential and one for residential
essentially

05:40:39.750 --> 05:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
05:40:42.788 --> 05:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
industrial office commercial big box
 
05:40:42.798 --> 05:40:44.470 align:start position:0%
industrial office commercial big box
stores

05:40:44.470 --> 05:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
stores
 
05:40:46.150 --> 05:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing obviously the
 
05:40:48.070 --> 05:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
seabrook nuclear power plant
 
05:40:50.628 --> 05:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
is the largest uh individual property
 
05:40:52.230 --> 05:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in seabrook and at one time
 
05:40:53.510 --> 05:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
they were paying almost 90 percent of
 
05:40:55.510 --> 05:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
the property taxes
 
05:40:57.030 --> 05:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
as time has gone on
 
05:40:58.948 --> 05:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
that amount has gone down and the burden
 
05:41:00.628 --> 05:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
has shifted around now they pay about 40
 
05:41:00.638 --> 05:41:02.548 align:start position:0%
has shifted around now they pay about 40
percent

05:41:02.548 --> 05:41:02.558 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:41:05.750 --> 05:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is intended to to deal with
 
05:41:08.390 --> 05:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
two problems one is dramatically rising
 
05:41:11.510 --> 05:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
residential property taxes
 
05:41:13.110 --> 05:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
which in some towns including very
 
05:41:16.708 --> 05:41:16.718 align:start position:0%
blue-collar seabrook is is
 
05:41:18.150 --> 05:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
threatening to force people out of their
 
05:41:18.160 --> 05:41:19.830 align:start position:0%
threatening to force people out of their
homes

05:41:19.830 --> 05:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
homes
 
05:41:22.390 --> 05:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
we had
 
05:41:24.390 --> 05:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
when i moved in i believe my
 
05:41:26.628 --> 05:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
property tax bill property tax bill for
 
05:41:28.548 --> 05:41:28.558 align:start position:0%
the whole neighborhood was about 300 a
 
05:41:30.070 --> 05:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
month for everything
 
05:41:33.510 --> 05:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh today it's almost 700 a month
 
05:41:35.110 --> 05:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
so there's a there's a tendency to want
 
05:41:37.190 --> 05:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
to talk about what the rate is versus
 
05:41:38.390 --> 05:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
the assessment
 
05:41:39.750 --> 05:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know the things that can be done
 
05:41:40.628 --> 05:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:41:43.430 --> 05:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
assessed value and so forth um but what
 
05:41:45.110 --> 05:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
what's killing us is just the fact that
 
05:41:46.948 --> 05:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
the the total bill is getting too high
 
05:41:48.548 --> 05:41:48.558 align:start position:0%
and what's happened in in
 
05:41:50.150 --> 05:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
business-friendly towns like seabrook
 
05:41:52.628 --> 05:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
originally years ago we thought well as
 
05:41:54.390 --> 05:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
the power plant pays less and less we'll
 
05:41:56.150 --> 05:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
attract more business and then business
 
05:41:57.670 --> 05:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
will take on more of the tax bill and
 
05:41:59.430 --> 05:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
then our prop our residential property
 
05:42:01.750 --> 05:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
taxes won't go up
 
05:42:03.350 --> 05:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
that is actually isn't what's happened
 
05:42:05.030 --> 05:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
what's happened is
 
05:42:06.868 --> 05:42:06.878 align:start position:0%
we've done studies in recent years
 
05:42:08.230 --> 05:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
finding that certain types of business
 
05:42:10.628 --> 05:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
like retail actually cost you know about
 
05:42:13.270 --> 05:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
18 or 19 dollars per thousand because of
 
05:42:16.628 --> 05:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
the higher restaurants and fast food and
 
05:42:18.310 --> 05:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
certain types of businesses take about
 
05:42:20.150 --> 05:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
18 to 20 dollars per thousand because of
 
05:42:21.350 --> 05:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
the higher rate of
 
05:42:24.868 --> 05:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
uh 911 calls um obviously water and
 
05:42:27.510 --> 05:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
wastewater garbage pickup you know per
 
05:42:29.110 --> 05:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
square foot for restaurants for fast
 
05:42:31.110 --> 05:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
food and drive-through restaurants the
 
05:42:32.788 --> 05:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
impact on the town
 
05:42:35.990 --> 05:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh towns is is actually a net negative
 
05:42:37.430 --> 05:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
and what's been happening is more and
 
05:42:39.110 --> 05:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
more towns are
 
05:42:40.868 --> 05:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
around new england are cutting off big
 
05:42:42.470 --> 05:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
box stores or cutting off certain types
 
05:42:44.868 --> 05:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
of development or instead of having a
 
05:42:46.390 --> 05:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
very business friendly planning board i
 
05:42:47.910 --> 05:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
was served on my town's planning board
 
05:42:49.510 --> 05:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
for three years instead of being
 
05:42:51.670 --> 05:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
business friendly in order to both
 
05:42:53.190 --> 05:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
create jobs
 
05:42:54.628 --> 05:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
and at the same time reduce our
 
05:42:56.788 --> 05:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
residential property tax bill what we're
 
05:42:58.628 --> 05:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
being told is that for certain types of
 
05:43:00.390 --> 05:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
business new business comes in and our
 
05:43:03.510 --> 05:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
property taxes actually go up
 
05:43:05.910 --> 05:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
so the response from towns has been more
 
05:43:07.750 --> 05:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
and more inclination towards stopping
 
05:43:09.750 --> 05:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
new business development and that's what
 
05:43:11.510 --> 05:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
i'm worried about
 
05:43:13.190 --> 05:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
as bad as property taxes can be for
 
05:43:16.390 --> 05:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
businesses the the zoning power can be
 
05:43:18.628 --> 05:43:18.638 align:start position:0%
just absolutely devastating and i've
 
05:43:20.390 --> 05:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
i've seen business owners come in time
 
05:43:22.390 --> 05:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
and again and once they they start
 
05:43:24.310 --> 05:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
hitting uh the red tape and regulations
 
05:43:25.670 --> 05:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
and once they're no longer being helped
 
05:43:26.948 --> 05:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
and once they're
 
05:43:28.868 --> 05:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
uh finding they can't get variances and
 
05:43:31.510 --> 05:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
conditional use permits anymore
 
05:43:32.948 --> 05:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
when the town turns against them it's
 
05:43:35.750 --> 05:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
almost impossible to put a a building up
 
05:43:37.990 --> 05:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
or even renovate or revise or expand a
 
05:43:38.000 --> 05:43:39.270 align:start position:0%
or even renovate or revise or expand a
building

05:43:39.270 --> 05:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
building
 
05:43:41.190 --> 05:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
without spending a lot of money on
 
05:43:41.200 --> 05:43:42.548 align:start position:0%
without spending a lot of money on
lawyers

05:43:42.548 --> 05:43:42.558 align:start position:0%
lawyers
 
05:43:44.070 --> 05:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
and that's not obviously that's not
 
05:43:46.150 --> 05:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
guaranteed either so
 
05:43:49.110 --> 05:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
my hope was to kind of return to a more
 
05:43:50.548 --> 05:43:50.558 align:start position:0%
business-friendly environment for all
 
05:43:52.390 --> 05:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
these border towns and towns that have a
 
05:43:55.030 --> 05:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
large amount of retail shopping
 
05:43:57.190 --> 05:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
that have lots of the strip malls and
 
05:43:59.670 --> 05:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
big box stores and whatnot
 
05:44:02.230 --> 05:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
to put that incentive in place um i'll
 
05:44:05.030 --> 05:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'll give you an idea of the impact
 
05:44:07.110 --> 05:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
based on the estimates that i did of the
 
05:44:10.070 --> 05:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
of the breakdown of the property tax
 
05:44:12.230 --> 05:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
in a place like seabrook residential
 
05:44:14.150 --> 05:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
property taxes if this passed would go
 
05:44:15.750 --> 05:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
down by an average of two thousand
 
05:44:17.190 --> 05:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
dollars a year almost two hundred
 
05:44:19.350 --> 05:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
dollars a month for residential property
 
05:44:21.350 --> 05:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
taxes because
 
05:44:22.948 --> 05:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
more than two thirds of our
 
05:44:24.230 --> 05:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh more than seventy percent of our
 
05:44:25.510 --> 05:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
05:44:27.590 --> 05:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
bases business the power plant the dog
 
05:44:27.600 --> 05:44:28.548 align:start position:0%
bases business the power plant the dog
track

05:44:28.548 --> 05:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
track
 
05:44:31.110 --> 05:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
big box stores and so forth
 
05:44:32.948 --> 05:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
hampton falls only has a small amount of
 
05:44:35.350 --> 05:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
commercial development so i'm not sure
 
05:44:37.350 --> 05:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
that they would adopt this because there
 
05:44:40.628 --> 05:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
isn't that much to be saved for them but
 
05:44:42.230 --> 05:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
hampton is split
 
05:44:43.990 --> 05:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's almost even so i think that hampton
 
05:44:45.430 --> 05:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
voters would
 
05:44:47.590 --> 05:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
probably inclined to support it since
 
05:44:49.110 --> 05:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
they would save about a thousand dollars
 
05:44:50.070 --> 05:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
a year
 
05:44:52.310 --> 05:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
in property taxes when we talk to
 
05:44:54.310 --> 05:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
business owners where i thought there
 
05:44:56.150 --> 05:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
might be some resistance small business
 
05:44:57.990 --> 05:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
owners have a business
 
05:44:59.990 --> 05:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
and they have a house
 
05:45:01.110 --> 05:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
so they own two so they're paying
 
05:45:02.788 --> 05:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
property taxes twice
 
05:45:05.510 --> 05:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
on the net on the whole almost all the
 
05:45:07.270 --> 05:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
business owners i talked to would have
 
05:45:08.788 --> 05:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
at least in seabrook would save money
 
05:45:10.868 --> 05:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
and would still vote for the measure
 
05:45:12.310 --> 05:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
because they would you know they might
 
05:45:14.390 --> 05:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
see their their business tax property
 
05:45:15.830 --> 05:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
tax go up by
 
05:45:17.430 --> 05:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
five or six or seven hundred dollars a
 
05:45:18.708 --> 05:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
year but then if they're saving two
 
05:45:20.390 --> 05:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year in residential
 
05:45:22.708 --> 05:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
property taxes is definitely worth it
 
05:45:24.708 --> 05:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
and and there's the the other issue that
 
05:45:26.230 --> 05:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
we brought up on municipal and county
 
05:45:28.390 --> 05:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
that that you do have it's it's only
 
05:45:29.910 --> 05:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
people who live in town who are voting
 
05:45:31.990 --> 05:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
on the property tax and that does affect
 
05:45:33.430 --> 05:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
the business community and the business
 
05:45:34.628 --> 05:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
community doesn't get to vote on the
 
05:45:36.708 --> 05:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
warrant articles so they're kind of at
 
05:45:39.510 --> 05:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
the mercy of it and we kind of
 
05:45:41.670 --> 05:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
we would we would benefit as a state and
 
05:45:43.110 --> 05:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
would certainly i think towns would
 
05:45:45.430 --> 05:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
benefit if
 
05:45:46.948 --> 05:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
the you know the marginal even though
 
05:45:49.110 --> 05:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
it's a smaller amount what's left over
 
05:45:50.628 --> 05:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
if the
 
05:45:52.070 --> 05:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
if you no longer have this kind of
 
05:45:53.590 --> 05:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
attitude where some voters are going in
 
05:45:54.788 --> 05:45:54.798 align:start position:0%
and saying well we'll get the power
 
05:45:56.628 --> 05:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
plant to pay for it we'll get all these
 
05:45:58.230 --> 05:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
businesses and we'll get these offices
 
05:45:59.990 --> 05:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
and industry to to pay for all these
 
05:46:02.150 --> 05:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
warrant articles some warren articles
 
05:46:04.230 --> 05:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
are absolutely necessary and even in
 
05:46:05.990 --> 05:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
seabrook even in tough years those still
 
05:46:07.750 --> 05:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
pass two to one
 
05:46:09.590 --> 05:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
um all the school worn articles pass
 
05:46:11.270 --> 05:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
every year
 
05:46:13.110 --> 05:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
most of the infrastructure stuff
 
05:46:14.788 --> 05:46:14.798 align:start position:0%
the absolute have to haves they pass
 
05:46:17.350 --> 05:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
every year but
 
05:46:18.948 --> 05:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
even i would admit that there are some
 
05:46:21.430 --> 05:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
weren't articles that
 
05:46:21.440 --> 05:46:22.708 align:start position:0%
weren't articles that
um

05:46:22.708 --> 05:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:23.990 --> 05:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
they're iffy or they don't need to be
 
05:46:25.270 --> 05:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
done this year or maybe they don't need
 
05:46:27.990 --> 05:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
to be done at all um and and the
 
05:46:29.830 --> 05:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
selectmen will just put put the question
 
05:46:30.948 --> 05:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
on about and say do you want to spend
 
05:46:32.548 --> 05:46:32.558 align:start position:0%
money on this new thing
 
05:46:32.558 --> 05:46:33.590 align:start position:0%
money on this new thing
and

05:46:33.590 --> 05:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:46:33.600 --> 05:46:35.110 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:46:35.110 --> 05:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:37.190 --> 05:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
normally those would fail but in in
 
05:46:38.948 --> 05:46:38.958 align:start position:0%
seabrook sometimes they pass just
 
05:46:41.510 --> 05:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
because there's this attitude of
 
05:46:43.190 --> 05:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
well you know we'll have we'll have
 
05:46:44.868 --> 05:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
business pay for it and that isn't
 
05:46:46.868 --> 05:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
really fair so what i tried to do with
 
05:46:49.510 --> 05:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is come up with one that was
 
05:46:51.190 --> 05:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
mainly business friendly and also
 
05:46:53.190 --> 05:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
residential property taxpayer family
 
05:46:55.590 --> 05:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
friendly so what businesses get is their
 
05:46:57.510 --> 05:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
property tax rate could go up by as much
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
as a dollar per thousand depending on
 
05:47:01.670 --> 05:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
how this is written on the town warrant
 
05:47:03.110 --> 05:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
but then that's locked in for three
 
05:47:04.628 --> 05:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
years so they get a stable rate what we
 
05:47:06.230 --> 05:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
consistently hear from business owners
 
05:47:07.990 --> 05:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
is they really need the stability they
 
05:47:09.350 --> 05:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
need to know
 
05:47:10.708 --> 05:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
you know what they need to finance what
 
05:47:12.230 --> 05:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
they need to do next year and the year
 
05:47:15.270 --> 05:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
after and the year after that
 
05:47:17.830 --> 05:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
the residential property owners would of
 
05:47:20.310 --> 05:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
course have the lower rate and some
 
05:47:21.990 --> 05:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
years you'd save a thousand a year some
 
05:47:23.750 --> 05:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
years you'd save 2000 years some years
 
05:47:26.070 --> 05:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
it would be about the same but overall
 
05:47:28.150 --> 05:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
residential property taxpayers would
 
05:47:29.750 --> 05:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
would save the money with uh that
 
05:47:32.628 --> 05:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
variable rate but it would encourage
 
05:47:35.270 --> 05:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
um on one hand land use regulations and
 
05:47:35.280 --> 05:47:36.470 align:start position:0%
um on one hand land use regulations and
rules

05:47:36.470 --> 05:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
rules
 
05:47:39.590 --> 05:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
that are more business friendly
 
05:47:42.948 --> 05:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
and because 70 percent of the state's
 
05:47:46.070 --> 05:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
revenue comes from business taxes
 
05:47:47.670 --> 05:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
and a disproportionate amount of course
 
05:47:50.310 --> 05:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
comes from business profits tax
 
05:47:50.320 --> 05:47:51.830 align:start position:0%
comes from business profits tax
and

05:47:51.830 --> 05:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:47:53.510 --> 05:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms tax
 
05:47:56.390 --> 05:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
are two very large sources of revenue
 
05:47:58.868 --> 05:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
that from our vantage point if a few
 
05:48:00.628 --> 05:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
towns did take advantage of this and we
 
05:48:02.948 --> 05:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
did then get more big box stores and
 
05:48:05.030 --> 05:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
more of the larger business development
 
05:48:06.788 --> 05:48:06.798 align:start position:0%
that the it would make the budgeting
 
05:48:08.070 --> 05:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
process a little bit easier in the
 
05:48:10.390 --> 05:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
future for the state i don't think that
 
05:48:14.310 --> 05:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:15.350 --> 05:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
05:48:18.230 --> 05:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
there are only a few towns in the state
 
05:48:19.830 --> 05:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
where there's such a disproportionate
 
05:48:21.670 --> 05:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
amount of business development that's
 
05:48:23.590 --> 05:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
there already
 
05:48:25.510 --> 05:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
but i i think that just looking at
 
05:48:27.510 --> 05:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
seabrook and hampton i think that it's
 
05:48:28.708 --> 05:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
likely they would
 
05:48:31.670 --> 05:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
they would probably take the option
 
05:48:33.510 --> 05:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
and my main concern the reason i put
 
05:48:35.190 --> 05:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
this bill in of course is
 
05:48:36.628 --> 05:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
we are seeing a lot of older folks
 
05:48:39.510 --> 05:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
people on fixed income disability
 
05:48:41.510 --> 05:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
people who are in a job where they're
 
05:48:43.110 --> 05:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
paid they don't get promoted every few
 
05:48:44.548 --> 05:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
years they don't get pay raises every
 
05:48:45.910 --> 05:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
few years and they're really kind of on
 
05:48:47.430 --> 05:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
fixed incomes
 
05:48:49.670 --> 05:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
i do have a lot of blue collar folks in
 
05:48:50.948 --> 05:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
my district and i have a lot of people
 
05:48:53.430 --> 05:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
who are on a fixed income so they
 
05:48:55.270 --> 05:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
they can't afford another
 
05:48:56.948 --> 05:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
you know two or three or four hundred
 
05:48:58.548 --> 05:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
dollars a month in property taxes they
 
05:48:59.990 --> 05:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
just can't afford it that would wipe
 
05:49:03.990 --> 05:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:04.000 --> 05:49:05.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:49:05.430 --> 05:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:49:08.868 --> 05:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:10.150 --> 05:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
05:49:13.350 --> 05:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
05:49:14.708 --> 05:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
simply put
 
05:49:18.070 --> 05:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
on to shifting the tax burden from one
 
05:49:20.390 --> 05:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
group of residents to
 
05:49:23.110 --> 05:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
another group which is residential to
 
05:49:25.910 --> 05:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
commercial commercial to you know at the
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
end of the day
 
05:49:27.520 --> 05:49:28.230 align:start position:0%
end of the day
the

05:49:28.230 --> 05:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:49:29.910 --> 05:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
tax revenue
 
05:49:34.230 --> 05:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
is what runs the towns and the cities
 
05:49:34.240 --> 05:49:35.190 align:start position:0%
is what runs the towns and the cities
and

05:49:35.190 --> 05:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:49:37.110 --> 05:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
by giving a break
 
05:49:39.910 --> 05:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
you're shifting it to the other so how
 
05:49:41.590 --> 05:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
would that benefit
 
05:49:44.070 --> 05:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh attracting more you're shifting it
 
05:49:45.670 --> 05:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
it's an option for for
 
05:49:48.070 --> 05:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
for towns with warrant articles so town
 
05:49:49.430 --> 05:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
form of government
 
05:49:51.670 --> 05:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
05:49:55.110 --> 05:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
it's there are two different ways
 
05:49:56.310 --> 05:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
there are two different ways that we
 
05:49:58.390 --> 05:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
benefit one is that it encourages the
 
05:50:00.788 --> 05:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
voters since it's
 
05:50:00.798 --> 05:50:02.548 align:start position:0%
voters since it's
um

05:50:02.548 --> 05:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:04.390 --> 05:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
voters must be taxpayers and taxpayers
 
05:50:06.868 --> 05:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
must be voters residential
 
05:50:08.708 --> 05:50:08.718 align:start position:0%
homeowners and apartment owners people
 
05:50:10.070 --> 05:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
who live in town are the only ones who
 
05:50:11.910 --> 05:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
are voting on the warrant articles so
 
05:50:13.590 --> 05:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's part of it we want to encourage
 
05:50:15.030 --> 05:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
people to be
 
05:50:16.788 --> 05:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
more prudent and more careful and get
 
05:50:18.070 --> 05:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
more involved
 
05:50:19.990 --> 05:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
at looking at the warn articles the
 
05:50:21.990 --> 05:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
bigger issue that i'm looking at over
 
05:50:24.868 --> 05:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
the long run is i'm seeing business
 
05:50:27.430 --> 05:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
friendly towns like seabrook when i ran
 
05:50:29.530 --> 05:50:29.540 align:start position:0%
for for planning board
 
05:50:29.540 --> 05:50:31.270 align:start position:0%
for for planning board
[Music]

05:50:31.270 --> 05:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:50:33.670 --> 05:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
i i was continuously hearing this this
 
05:50:35.830 --> 05:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
concern we originally were a very
 
05:50:37.670 --> 05:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
business friendly town
 
05:50:39.030 --> 05:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
top to bottom
 
05:50:40.948 --> 05:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
in order to get business to pay more of
 
05:50:42.548 --> 05:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
the property tax bill
 
05:50:42.558 --> 05:50:43.430 align:start position:0%
the property tax bill
so

05:50:43.430 --> 05:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:50:45.830 --> 05:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
towns and planting boards and town hall
 
05:50:47.270 --> 05:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
they can just say we don't want any more
 
05:50:47.280 --> 05:50:48.390 align:start position:0%
they can just say we don't want any more
apartments

05:50:48.390 --> 05:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
apartments
 
05:50:49.670 --> 05:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
we don't want any more big box stores
 
05:50:51.590 --> 05:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
i'm even hearing some people in town
 
05:50:52.948 --> 05:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
don't want big box stores even in
 
05:50:54.548 --> 05:50:54.558 align:start position:0%
seabrook and we're right on the border
 
05:50:55.990 --> 05:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
right on the border with massachusetts
 
05:50:58.708 --> 05:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
and driving distance of maine so if you
 
05:51:00.230 --> 05:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
have more and more towns cutting back on
 
05:51:03.190 --> 05:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
big box stores and large developments it
 
05:51:05.590 --> 05:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
hurts the state's revenue it hurts
 
05:51:08.150 --> 05:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
jobs for the state and
 
05:51:11.750 --> 05:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
it would reduce the state's overall
 
05:51:14.230 --> 05:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
revenue source so we want to maintain
 
05:51:15.750 --> 05:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
we want towns to have a strong enough
 
05:51:15.760 --> 05:51:17.190 align:start position:0%
we want towns to have a strong enough
incentive

05:51:17.190 --> 05:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
05:51:20.230 --> 05:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh in some way shape or form to
 
05:51:21.750 --> 05:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
attract more business and maintain
 
05:51:24.150 --> 05:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
business friendly zoning laws and land
 
05:51:30.150 --> 05:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:31.910 --> 05:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
i think mr chair and and thank you for
 
05:51:34.470 --> 05:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i i will admit
 
05:51:37.110 --> 05:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
that i do have concern that will push
 
05:51:39.110 --> 05:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
large businesses out of your town or
 
05:51:42.470 --> 05:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
your city but my question is um
 
05:51:44.548 --> 05:51:44.558 align:start position:0%
how does this work with cities i i know
 
05:51:45.990 --> 05:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
that they have to pass an ordinance or
 
05:51:48.070 --> 05:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
something but the dra
 
05:51:51.830 --> 05:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
approves our rate the dra would have to
 
05:51:53.270 --> 05:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
take the budget
 
05:51:54.948 --> 05:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
create a
 
05:51:57.110 --> 05:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
a rate for
 
05:51:57.120 --> 05:51:58.948 align:start position:0%
a rate for
each

05:51:58.948 --> 05:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
each
 
05:52:01.990 --> 05:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
body so for residential and for
 
05:52:03.350 --> 05:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
businesses they would have to come up
 
05:52:05.190 --> 05:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
with their own rate
 
05:52:05.200 --> 05:52:06.230 align:start position:0%
with their own rate
it's

05:52:06.230 --> 05:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:52:08.390 --> 05:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
in the warrant article it it's it's for
 
05:52:10.868 --> 05:52:10.878 align:start position:0%
towns with warrant articles um
 
05:52:13.590 --> 05:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
we don't i pardon me my pardon my and we
 
05:52:15.430 --> 05:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
don't do warrant articles in cities yep
 
05:52:17.670 --> 05:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
yep so the measure is a local option for
 
05:52:19.110 --> 05:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
towns with warrant articles it's kind of
 
05:52:20.548 --> 05:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
town form of government which is run
 
05:52:21.910 --> 05:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
very differently does budgeting very
 
05:52:23.430 --> 05:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
differently cities have a lot more
 
05:52:26.070 --> 05:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility in how they do budgeting
 
05:52:27.510 --> 05:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
they're able to do
 
05:52:28.948 --> 05:52:28.958 align:start position:0%
things like put contracts up for
 
05:52:30.628 --> 05:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
competitive bid in november and december
 
05:52:32.070 --> 05:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
and they get to save
 
05:52:33.350 --> 05:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
money you know they can move funds
 
05:52:34.628 --> 05:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
around and they have more flexibility
 
05:52:36.948 --> 05:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
than we have in towns
 
05:52:38.868 --> 05:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
so this was aimed at
 
05:52:41.030 --> 05:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
specifically towns if there are members
 
05:52:42.310 --> 05:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
of the committee who want this amended
 
05:52:44.390 --> 05:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
to include cities i'm willing to to go
 
05:52:47.510 --> 05:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
do the legwork and research on that
 
05:52:49.910 --> 05:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
but what it says is yeah it would allow
 
05:52:51.350 --> 05:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
the voters to
 
05:52:53.350 --> 05:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
to push and it'd be the wording would be
 
05:52:55.430 --> 05:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the warren article should the town of
 
05:52:57.270 --> 05:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
seabrook separate his property tax rate
 
05:52:58.310 --> 05:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
to raise
 
05:52:58.320 --> 05:52:59.110 align:start position:0%
to raise
the

05:52:59.110 --> 05:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:53:02.070 --> 05:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
business rate up by could be 50 cents 75
 
05:53:04.150 --> 05:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
cents or a dollar per thousand or any
 
05:53:05.590 --> 05:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
amount up to that
 
05:53:07.750 --> 05:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
and that would have businesses taking on
 
05:53:10.470 --> 05:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
more of the tax burden that's true
 
05:53:13.270 --> 05:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
but for in seabrook a dollar more per
 
05:53:15.670 --> 05:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
thousand for business results in three
 
05:53:17.830 --> 05:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
or four dollars less per thousand for
 
05:53:17.840 --> 05:53:19.190 align:start position:0%
or four dollars less per thousand for
residential

05:53:19.190 --> 05:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
residential
 
05:53:21.430 --> 05:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
for residential property owners now it
 
05:53:23.670 --> 05:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
is we have to be realistic it's also the
 
05:53:25.270 --> 05:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
same residential property owners who are
 
05:53:26.948 --> 05:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
voting on the zoning laws and land use
 
05:53:29.030 --> 05:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
regulations and whether or not to enact
 
05:53:31.110 --> 05:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
impact fees and other development fees
 
05:53:31.120 --> 05:53:31.910 align:start position:0%
impact fees and other development fees
and

05:53:31.910 --> 05:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:53:34.310 --> 05:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
and and so forth and and
 
05:53:36.470 --> 05:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
as a former planning board member myself
 
05:53:38.230 --> 05:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
i was answerable
 
05:53:40.310 --> 05:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
directly to residential property owners
 
05:53:42.390 --> 05:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
and not business owners and business the
 
05:53:44.548 --> 05:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
businesses overwhelmingly tended to be
 
05:53:47.350 --> 05:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
out of state and didn't have that much
 
05:53:49.190 --> 05:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
representation so they kind of have a
 
05:53:50.628 --> 05:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
tendency to just be at the mercy of
 
05:53:53.110 --> 05:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
whatever residential property owners do
 
05:53:55.190 --> 05:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
residential voters do so the the the
 
05:53:56.868 --> 05:53:56.878 align:start position:0%
hammer that people can bring down
 
05:53:59.270 --> 05:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
against business right now is basically
 
05:54:01.030 --> 05:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
to just completely wipe out all new
 
05:54:03.190 --> 05:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
development and just say no big box
 
05:54:05.430 --> 05:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
stores and there are towns all over new
 
05:54:07.510 --> 05:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
england that are saying no more big box
 
05:54:08.948 --> 05:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
stores none
 
05:54:10.628 --> 05:54:10.638 align:start position:0%
and they're completely putting a stop to
 
05:54:12.070 --> 05:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
05:54:13.430 --> 05:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things i'm trying to stop
 
05:54:14.628 --> 05:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
with this bill i'm trying to make sure
 
05:54:14.638 --> 05:54:16.708 align:start position:0%
with this bill i'm trying to make sure
that

05:54:16.708 --> 05:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:54:19.430 --> 05:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
residential voters understand
 
05:54:19.440 --> 05:54:20.390 align:start position:0%
residential voters understand
that

05:54:20.390 --> 05:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:54:23.590 --> 05:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
a big box store pays a lot of taxes
 
05:54:26.070 --> 05:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
and can help a lot can help a lot to
 
05:54:29.030 --> 05:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
reduce the tax burden
 
05:54:30.868 --> 05:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
mr chairman have a follow-up yes go
 
05:54:34.948 --> 05:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
ahead i i'm not quite sure that um
 
05:54:36.788 --> 05:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
that you understood when i read this
 
05:54:38.390 --> 05:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
line 26
 
05:54:40.150 --> 05:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
it says in a city or town that has
 
05:54:41.990 --> 05:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
adopted a charter pursuant to blah blah
 
05:54:43.830 --> 05:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
blah right the legislative body may
 
05:54:45.670 --> 05:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
consider an act upon the question in
 
05:54:47.110 --> 05:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
accordance with this normal procedure
 
05:54:50.150 --> 05:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
for passage of resolutions the title of
 
05:54:53.030 --> 05:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
it is allowing towns and cities
 
05:54:55.030 --> 05:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
to tax residential and non-resident
 
05:54:57.030 --> 05:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
property at different rates so it
 
05:54:58.628 --> 05:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
already does
 
05:55:00.230 --> 05:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
address cities
 
05:55:02.150 --> 05:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
my question still is
 
05:55:04.390 --> 05:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
how would the dra have you spoken to
 
05:55:06.150 --> 05:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
them i guess i should have asked it that
 
05:55:09.030 --> 05:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
way how would the dra calculate
 
05:55:10.548 --> 05:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
a different
 
05:55:10.558 --> 05:55:11.670 align:start position:0%
a different
rate

05:55:11.670 --> 05:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
rate
 
05:55:14.150 --> 05:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
for residents versus right now we're all
 
05:55:15.910 --> 05:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
at the same rate
 
05:55:17.990 --> 05:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
they may go to court and disagree with
 
05:55:19.990 --> 05:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
the assessment
 
05:55:22.070 --> 05:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
but regardless they're going to pay the
 
05:55:24.150 --> 05:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
same rate the residentials do how would
 
05:55:25.830 --> 05:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
05:55:25.840 --> 05:55:26.470 align:start position:0%
the dra
you

05:55:26.470 --> 05:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:55:28.310 --> 05:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
i understand you outlined it with towns
 
05:55:30.628 --> 05:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
and warrants and so on
 
05:55:32.868 --> 05:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
um cities don't work that way we do
 
05:55:35.270 --> 05:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
ordinances and so we could adopt this
 
05:55:37.670 --> 05:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
through an ordinance but how would it
 
05:55:37.680 --> 05:55:40.788 align:start position:0%
through an ordinance but how would it
work

05:55:40.788 --> 05:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:40.798 --> 05:55:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:55:41.750 --> 05:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:55:44.230 --> 05:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
the way dra does it for seabrook um and
 
05:55:45.350 --> 05:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
i've talked to folks in the finance
 
05:55:46.628 --> 05:55:46.638 align:start position:0%
department and a few years ago i did
 
05:55:49.270 --> 05:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
talk to dra about how about this issue
 
05:55:51.190 --> 05:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
about allowing two different rates
 
05:55:52.788 --> 05:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
but that's that's long before actually
 
05:55:54.788 --> 05:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill
 
05:55:56.788 --> 05:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
if it were done using this mechanism
 
05:55:59.030 --> 05:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
then the the article itself allows them
 
05:56:01.110 --> 05:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
to increase the business rate by up to
 
05:56:02.948 --> 05:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
one dollar per thousand and they can
 
05:56:04.470 --> 05:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
estimate what the amount of revenue is
 
05:56:07.030 --> 05:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
for that and then whatever is left over
 
05:56:08.708 --> 05:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
is paid for by residential the smaller
 
05:56:10.310 --> 05:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
amount that's that remains is what's
 
05:56:11.350 --> 05:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
paid for
 
05:56:14.868 --> 05:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
um by residential
 
05:56:16.230 --> 05:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay and uh thank you for that
 
05:56:19.830 --> 05:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
clarification mr chairman i thank you um
 
05:56:22.548 --> 05:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
then my next question is um
 
05:56:24.470 --> 05:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
in the city of nashville we consider any
 
05:56:27.910 --> 05:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
apartment building five and up
 
05:56:29.590 --> 05:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
as commercial
 
05:56:31.830 --> 05:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
would that fall within your
 
05:56:34.548 --> 05:56:34.558 align:start position:0%
within this business versus
 
05:56:36.868 --> 05:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
a residential you could have a five unit
 
05:56:36.878 --> 05:56:37.990 align:start position:0%
a residential you could have a five unit
apartment

05:56:37.990 --> 05:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
05:56:41.110 --> 05:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
in a fully residential area would you
 
05:56:42.548 --> 05:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
tax them at a different rate than you
 
05:56:43.750 --> 05:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
would tax
 
05:56:45.750 --> 05:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
the next door neighbor yeah to be fair
 
05:56:47.830 --> 05:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
um i did consider apartments and i also
 
05:56:49.350 --> 05:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
have a provision in the bill for mixed
 
05:56:49.360 --> 05:56:50.750 align:start position:0%
have a provision in the bill for mixed
use

05:56:50.750 --> 05:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
use
 
05:56:50.760 --> 05:56:52.310 align:start position:0%
use
[Music]

05:56:52.310 --> 05:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:56:53.830 --> 05:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
so apartments would be considered
 
05:56:55.750 --> 05:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
residential for property tax purposes
 
05:56:58.150 --> 05:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
even if you had a town or city that that
 
05:56:59.990 --> 05:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
only allows apartments in
 
05:57:02.788 --> 05:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
commercial or even industrial or um i
 
05:57:04.390 --> 05:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
worked with form-based codes so if you
 
05:57:07.990 --> 05:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
have you know t1 t2 t3 t4 zones
 
05:57:10.310 --> 05:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
different density zones it would still
 
05:57:13.510 --> 05:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
work there it's it's the use of
 
05:57:15.750 --> 05:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
the building itself and if you had a
 
05:57:17.990 --> 05:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
split use like you had two floors of
 
05:57:19.910 --> 05:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
residential and one floor of commercial
 
05:57:21.830 --> 05:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
down on the bottom which is very common
 
05:57:23.750 --> 05:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
in cities
 
05:57:26.390 --> 05:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
down at the the down
 
05:57:28.150 --> 05:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
floor that would be considered business
 
05:57:29.990 --> 05:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
it would be taxed at the higher rate and
 
05:57:31.670 --> 05:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
then the upper floors would be taxed at
 
05:57:34.150 --> 05:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
the lower rate and the surrounding land
 
05:57:35.590 --> 05:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
would be taxed at the lower residential
 
05:57:38.230 --> 05:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
rates so the intent is
 
05:57:40.390 --> 05:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
it gives resident it gives the voters an
 
05:57:42.230 --> 05:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
incentive to
 
05:57:43.750 --> 05:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
do a little extra work to keep the
 
05:57:46.070 --> 05:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
property tax burden down and also keep a
 
05:57:47.910 --> 05:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
business friendly environment
 
05:57:53.590 --> 05:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:56.470 --> 05:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
05:57:57.910 --> 05:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:57:59.830 --> 05:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative my
 
05:58:02.310 --> 05:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
question pertains to the number three
 
05:58:05.830 --> 05:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
as a as it relates to lines 17 and 18.
 
05:58:08.628 --> 05:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
how did you come up with the the time of
 
05:58:11.590 --> 05:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
three property tax years and what
 
05:58:14.628 --> 05:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
happens to this separate tax rate
 
05:58:17.270 --> 05:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
after three years does it simply expire
 
05:58:19.270 --> 05:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
yes it's only a three-year provision i
 
05:58:21.350 --> 05:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
assume that if if people are saving
 
05:58:22.628 --> 05:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
money my assumption is that they're
 
05:58:23.990 --> 05:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
going to keep renewing it every three
 
05:58:24.000 --> 05:58:25.350 align:start position:0%
going to keep renewing it every three
years

05:58:25.350 --> 05:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:58:27.910 --> 05:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
the reason for doing three years
 
05:58:27.920 --> 05:58:28.788 align:start position:0%
the reason for doing three years
sorry

05:58:28.788 --> 05:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:58:30.708 --> 05:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
the reason for doing three years is is
 
05:58:33.910 --> 05:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:35.350 --> 05:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
trying to think i think it was the
 
05:58:36.948 --> 05:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
conservative party's definition of
 
05:58:39.110 --> 05:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
conservatism is being realistic about
 
05:58:40.548 --> 05:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
human behavior
 
05:58:43.590 --> 05:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
um and that people do tend to vote
 
05:58:45.270 --> 05:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
for what they believe is in their best
 
05:58:45.280 --> 05:58:46.548 align:start position:0%
for what they believe is in their best
interests

05:58:46.548 --> 05:58:46.558 align:start position:0%
interests
 
05:58:48.788 --> 05:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
um people tend to act in their best
 
05:58:48.798 --> 05:58:50.628 align:start position:0%
um people tend to act in their best
interests

05:58:50.628 --> 05:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
interests
 
05:58:52.788 --> 05:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
my my concern was what if somebody tried
 
05:58:54.310 --> 05:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
you know or a group of voters tried to
 
05:58:56.390 --> 05:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
game the system somehow that they would
 
05:58:57.670 --> 05:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
enact this
 
05:58:59.430 --> 05:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
and then that same year they would try
 
05:59:01.590 --> 05:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
to buy a whole bunch of new you know all
 
05:59:03.750 --> 05:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
sorts of gold-plated
 
05:59:05.670 --> 05:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
brand new ladder truck and brand new
 
05:59:07.590 --> 05:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
this that and the other thing and add
 
05:59:11.430 --> 05:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
all kinds of additions that year
 
05:59:13.510 --> 05:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
to try to pass this measure and then in
 
05:59:14.868 --> 05:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
the same year pass a whole bunch of
 
05:59:17.430 --> 05:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
warrant articles to just
 
05:59:19.110 --> 05:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
expand the rec center and expand the
 
05:59:21.110 --> 05:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
library and get that overpass people
 
05:59:22.470 --> 05:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
wanted but they didn't want to really
 
05:59:23.910 --> 05:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
pay for it and
 
05:59:26.708 --> 05:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth um locking it in
 
05:59:28.390 --> 05:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
for three years is a way of kind of
 
05:59:30.070 --> 05:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
protecting the business community from
 
05:59:31.750 --> 05:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
just a sudden surge resulting from
 
05:59:33.750 --> 05:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
people saying hey
 
05:59:35.270 --> 05:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
we'll get the power plant to pay for it
 
05:59:36.948 --> 05:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
and that that's at that actually is what
 
05:59:39.190 --> 05:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
happened in seabrook um the power plant
 
05:59:41.990 --> 05:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
came in it was paying 85 to 90
 
05:59:43.430 --> 05:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
and people just said well the power
 
05:59:44.628 --> 05:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
plant will pay for it
 
05:59:46.230 --> 05:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
brand new fire station even though we
 
05:59:47.990 --> 05:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
already had one brand new police station
 
05:59:48.000 --> 05:59:48.830 align:start position:0%
already had one brand new police station
brand

05:59:48.830 --> 05:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
brand
 
05:59:51.750 --> 05:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
new library all sorts of you know brand
 
05:59:54.150 --> 05:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
new parks and accessories and things
 
05:59:56.150 --> 05:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
that are that are definitely not nice to
 
05:59:58.708 --> 05:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
have but if the question had been
 
06:00:01.110 --> 06:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
well if you have to pay for it would you
 
06:00:03.510 --> 06:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
pay for it and now that the now that the
 
06:00:05.430 --> 06:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
nuclear power plant only pays about 40
 
06:00:07.830 --> 06:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
percent a lot of people are saying wow
 
06:00:10.070 --> 06:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
this is this is really expensive our tax
 
06:00:11.670 --> 06:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
bill has gone
 
06:00:14.150 --> 06:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's more than doubled
 
06:00:14.160 --> 06:00:17.430 align:start position:0%
it's more than doubled
um

06:00:17.430 --> 06:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:18.708 --> 06:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
you know so that's kind of hence the
 
06:00:20.150 --> 06:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
idea but the reason for the three-year
 
06:00:23.830 --> 06:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
lock-in rate is is is to provide
 
06:00:26.070 --> 06:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
business would get at least some benefit
 
06:00:27.350 --> 06:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
the benefit that they get is the
 
06:00:30.390 --> 06:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
stability and being protected from
 
06:00:30.400 --> 06:00:31.430 align:start position:0%
stability and being protected from
um

06:00:31.430 --> 06:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:32.628 --> 06:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
you know what they used to call in the
 
06:00:34.628 --> 06:00:34.638 align:start position:0%
old days the tyranny of the majority
 
06:00:34.638 --> 06:00:35.590 align:start position:0%
old days the tyranny of the majority
that

06:00:35.590 --> 06:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:00:37.350 --> 06:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
it is it is possible to have a majority
 
06:00:39.510 --> 06:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
of people in town just say hey let's get
 
06:00:40.708 --> 06:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
some free stuff
 
06:00:40.718 --> 06:00:41.670 align:start position:0%
some free stuff
um

06:00:41.670 --> 06:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:44.548 --> 06:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
tax me tax the oh don't tax me don't tax
 
06:00:46.948 --> 06:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
the tax the man behind the tree
 
06:00:46.958 --> 06:00:48.230 align:start position:0%
the tax the man behind the tree
um

06:00:48.230 --> 06:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:49.510 --> 06:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know we don't we want to have all
 
06:00:50.708 --> 06:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
the nice things but we don't want to pay
 
06:00:53.030 --> 06:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
for it i wanted to have a provision that
 
06:00:53.040 --> 06:00:53.910 align:start position:0%
for it i wanted to have a provision that
said

06:00:53.910 --> 06:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
said
 
06:00:55.510 --> 06:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay you can have it but you've got to
 
06:00:57.350 --> 06:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
pay for it it's not right to keep
 
06:01:05.110 --> 06:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:06.470 --> 06:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
06:01:09.030 --> 06:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
06:01:09.040 --> 06:01:10.150 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

06:01:10.150 --> 06:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:12.470 --> 06:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
i'm from merrimack and i doubt this is
 
06:01:15.670 --> 06:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
something we would do our two biggest uh
 
06:01:17.670 --> 06:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
non-residential property taxpayers are
 
06:01:20.628 --> 06:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
fidelity investments and inbev we have
 
06:01:23.030 --> 06:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
an anheuser-busch brewery
 
06:01:23.040 --> 06:01:24.150 align:start position:0%
an anheuser-busch brewery
um

06:01:24.150 --> 06:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:25.750 --> 06:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think they would be really happy
 
06:01:27.510 --> 06:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
if we passed this
 
06:01:31.270 --> 06:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
but i in reading through it why
 
06:01:33.350 --> 06:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
it seems like the only option for a
 
06:01:35.750 --> 06:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
municipality is to raise
 
06:01:39.430 --> 06:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
taxes on non-residential property owners
 
06:01:41.110 --> 06:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
why is there not a provision in case
 
06:01:42.788 --> 06:01:42.798 align:start position:0%
there might be a circumstance a town
 
06:01:44.628 --> 06:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
wants to lower
 
06:01:47.590 --> 06:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
the property tax for non-residential
 
06:01:49.510 --> 06:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
maybe they want to attract more business
 
06:01:49.520 --> 06:01:50.390 align:start position:0%
maybe they want to attract more business
or

06:01:50.390 --> 06:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:01:53.030 --> 06:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
or something like that i mean is why is
 
06:01:55.030 --> 06:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
only one option available
 
06:01:59.830 --> 06:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:01.750 --> 06:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
i i can kind of
 
06:02:03.830 --> 06:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
guess which way my three towns would
 
06:02:05.590 --> 06:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
likely go with this measure but it's
 
06:02:07.750 --> 06:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
just a guess it's kind of speculation
 
06:02:10.230 --> 06:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh merrimack i don't know in fact there
 
06:02:11.430 --> 06:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of
 
06:02:12.628 --> 06:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
towns where
 
06:02:14.230 --> 06:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
sorry there are a lot of towns where 80
 
06:02:15.990 --> 06:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
to 90 percent of the tax bill just comes
 
06:02:17.510 --> 06:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
from residential right now i used to
 
06:02:19.030 --> 06:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
live in um
 
06:02:22.070 --> 06:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
deerfield and i think it was 90 was
 
06:02:24.628 --> 06:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
residential so there'd be no reason even
 
06:02:26.708 --> 06:02:26.718 align:start position:0%
to contact the town's lawyer and have
 
06:02:28.628 --> 06:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
them look at this but there are a lot of
 
06:02:31.020 --> 06:02:31.030 align:start position:0%
towns that are near 50 50.
 
06:02:31.030 --> 06:02:32.868 align:start position:0%
towns that are near 50 50.
[Music]

06:02:32.868 --> 06:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:02:34.868 --> 06:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
i think that it's
 
06:02:36.788 --> 06:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
it's fairer
 
06:02:39.430 --> 06:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
in the long run to business
 
06:02:39.440 --> 06:02:40.390 align:start position:0%
in the long run to business
to

06:02:40.390 --> 06:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:02:42.948 --> 06:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
incentivize the towns to create that
 
06:02:45.030 --> 06:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
more business-friendly environment
 
06:02:47.030 --> 06:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
and and i kept bringing up zoning and
 
06:02:48.310 --> 06:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
land-use regulations but there are
 
06:02:50.150 --> 06:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
actually a lot of different things on
 
06:02:53.030 --> 06:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know permits and licensing fees and
 
06:02:55.990 --> 06:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
expansions and and whether or not
 
06:02:57.750 --> 06:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
the selectmen should give an abatement
 
06:02:58.788 --> 06:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
whether or not planning board should
 
06:03:00.390 --> 06:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
offer a conditional use permit whether
 
06:03:02.310 --> 06:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
the zoning board gives gives out
 
06:03:06.070 --> 06:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
variances and whatnot towns
 
06:03:06.080 --> 06:03:07.750 align:start position:0%
variances and whatnot towns
choose

06:03:07.750 --> 06:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
choose
 
06:03:09.590 --> 06:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
and they they can go very fast one way
 
06:03:11.350 --> 06:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
or the other
 
06:03:13.990 --> 06:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i i felt like while i was on the
 
06:03:15.510 --> 06:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
planning board i felt like seabrook
 
06:03:17.990 --> 06:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
could very quickly go from
 
06:03:19.430 --> 06:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
business friendly
 
06:03:21.430 --> 06:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
to not business friendly at all that it
 
06:03:22.708 --> 06:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
could that they could pull up the
 
06:03:24.230 --> 06:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
drawbridge and say no more no more
 
06:03:26.150 --> 06:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
development the same way in the 1980s
 
06:03:28.390 --> 06:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
they said no more apartment developments
 
06:03:30.548 --> 06:03:30.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely none and there and there's
 
06:03:32.548 --> 06:03:32.558 align:start position:0%
there's a degree of attitude by people
 
06:03:33.990 --> 06:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
who've lived in seabrook for a long time
 
06:03:35.190 --> 06:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
no more apartments because they felt
 
06:03:36.948 --> 06:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
like they were overloaded if they
 
06:03:38.310 --> 06:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
started saying the same thing about big
 
06:03:39.910 --> 06:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
box stores and and
 
06:03:41.190 --> 06:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
industrial developments and large
 
06:03:43.910 --> 06:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
business developments um there'd be no
 
06:03:45.510 --> 06:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
more large there'd be no more large
 
06:03:47.910 --> 06:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
buildings coming into town
 
06:03:49.030 --> 06:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:03:50.708 --> 06:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
and this this state
 
06:03:53.350 --> 06:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
if more and more towns start moving away
 
06:03:54.788 --> 06:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
from the business friendly environment
 
06:03:56.708 --> 06:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
to just pulling up the drawbridge and
 
06:03:58.310 --> 06:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
using their zoning powers or their or
 
06:03:59.590 --> 06:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
their town powers or selectmen's
 
06:03:59.600 --> 06:04:00.868 align:start position:0%
their town powers or selectmen's
abilities

06:04:00.868 --> 06:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
abilities
 
06:04:03.270 --> 06:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
powers there'd be
 
06:04:03.280 --> 06:04:04.070 align:start position:0%
powers there'd be
a

06:04:04.070 --> 06:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:04:05.830 --> 06:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
a real stunt
 
06:04:05.840 --> 06:04:07.350 align:start position:0%
a real stunt
in

06:04:07.350 --> 06:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:04:11.030 --> 06:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
in in large business development so
 
06:04:13.510 --> 06:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
you have anheuser-busch you have or
 
06:04:15.590 --> 06:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
portsmouth has a lot of large
 
06:04:17.430 --> 06:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
business development they have a lot of
 
06:04:19.510 --> 06:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
large companies if they said hey we
 
06:04:21.590 --> 06:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
don't want any more large big box stores
 
06:04:24.708 --> 06:04:24.718 align:start position:0%
or car dealerships or anything coming in
 
06:04:26.390 --> 06:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
because now the cost is just a little
 
06:04:28.310 --> 06:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
too high to serve them if they're saying
 
06:04:30.310 --> 06:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
hey that actually hurts us as property
 
06:04:32.788 --> 06:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
taxes that taxpayers takes away that
 
06:04:34.070 --> 06:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
incentive to maintain a business
 
06:04:35.590 --> 06:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
friendly environment and there are there
 
06:04:36.948 --> 06:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
are towns and cities that aren't that
 
06:04:41.190 --> 06:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:43.590 --> 06:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:45.350 --> 06:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
there may be a distinction between
 
06:04:47.270 --> 06:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
commercial which i think you're citing
 
06:04:50.868 --> 06:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
and industrial but uh i'm still looking
 
06:04:53.110 --> 06:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
for the answer why you think raising
 
06:04:59.030 --> 06:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:00.310 --> 06:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
06:05:02.150 --> 06:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
every single business owner i knew in
 
06:05:02.160 --> 06:05:03.350 align:start position:0%
every single business owner i knew in
seabrook

06:05:03.350 --> 06:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
seabrook
 
06:05:05.830 --> 06:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
every single one i talked to had a home
 
06:05:07.590 --> 06:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
and a business that they have two
 
06:05:07.600 --> 06:05:08.628 align:start position:0%
and a business that they have two
properties

06:05:08.628 --> 06:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
properties
 
06:05:10.628 --> 06:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
and they told me that when i brought
 
06:05:13.350 --> 06:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
this suggestion to them every single one
 
06:05:15.030 --> 06:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
said that they would see
 
06:05:16.548 --> 06:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
basically a net
 
06:05:16.558 --> 06:05:17.590 align:start position:0%
basically a net
savings

06:05:17.590 --> 06:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
savings
 
06:05:19.510 --> 06:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously the nuclear power plant
 
06:05:21.110 --> 06:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
would pay more obviously there are a few
 
06:05:23.590 --> 06:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
big box stores that would pay more
 
06:05:25.030 --> 06:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
but remember
 
06:05:27.510 --> 06:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
right now as taxpayers
 
06:05:30.230 --> 06:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
are our total payout for big box stores
 
06:05:32.150 --> 06:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
big box retails it was something like 18
 
06:05:34.868 --> 06:05:34.878 align:start position:0%
or 19 dollars per thousand and our tax
 
06:05:37.910 --> 06:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
rate is 16 dollars per thousand
 
06:05:39.350 --> 06:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
so we're
 
06:05:41.030 --> 06:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
actually being forced to subsidize
 
06:05:42.948 --> 06:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
certain types of business development
 
06:05:44.948 --> 06:05:44.958 align:start position:0%
and as people became aware of that there
 
06:05:47.270 --> 06:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
were full-on department heads there were
 
06:05:48.948 --> 06:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
planning board members now saying wait a
 
06:05:50.470 --> 06:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
minute there are certain types of
 
06:05:53.270 --> 06:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
business development we can't recoup the
 
06:05:56.070 --> 06:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
cost we can't even come close
 
06:05:56.080 --> 06:05:57.030 align:start position:0%
cost we can't even come close
so

06:05:57.030 --> 06:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:05:59.350 --> 06:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
why can't we charge seventeen dollars
 
06:06:01.030 --> 06:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
per thousand if we're paying eighteen to
 
06:06:02.868 --> 06:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
nineteen dollars per thousand
 
06:06:04.788 --> 06:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
another thing that a lot of voters in my
 
06:06:06.948 --> 06:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
area and not just in seabrook said is
 
06:06:08.868 --> 06:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
that they don't like being forced to
 
06:06:11.990 --> 06:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
subsidize and this is this was left
 
06:06:14.628 --> 06:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
right middle libertarian everywhere on
 
06:06:16.948 --> 06:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
the political spectrum everyone hated
 
06:06:19.110 --> 06:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
having to pay extra taxes
 
06:06:20.548 --> 06:06:20.558 align:start position:0%
even if it were a small amount but if
 
06:06:21.990 --> 06:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
they're having to pay extra taxes to
 
06:06:23.750 --> 06:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
subsidize business development they
 
06:06:25.430 --> 06:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
hated that once they found out that they
 
06:06:27.430 --> 06:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
were having to subsidize anything
 
06:06:30.390 --> 06:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
so really big box retail
 
06:06:32.310 --> 06:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
should be paying its own way and if it
 
06:06:34.470 --> 06:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
costs if it costs over 18 dollars per
 
06:06:34.480 --> 06:06:35.670 align:start position:0%
costs if it costs over 18 dollars per
thousand

06:06:35.670 --> 06:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
06:06:38.390 --> 06:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
to provide myriad public services to
 
06:06:41.670 --> 06:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
them then it's it's
 
06:06:43.030 --> 06:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
06:06:44.548 --> 06:06:44.558 align:start position:0%
i don't think that it's unfair to charge
 
06:06:45.990 --> 06:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
them 17
 
06:06:48.788 --> 06:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
to provide 18 or 19
 
06:06:51.510 --> 06:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
in and services if anything in that for
 
06:06:53.590 --> 06:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
that case for for towns like ours this
 
06:06:55.670 --> 06:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
would just reduce the subsidy to
 
06:06:55.680 --> 06:06:57.430 align:start position:0%
would just reduce the subsidy to
business

06:06:57.430 --> 06:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
business
 
06:06:59.910 --> 06:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh next we're going to hear from
 
06:06:59.920 --> 06:07:00.868 align:start position:0%
okay uh next we're going to hear from
nick

06:07:08.708 --> 06:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
oh is that it for me that's it okay
 
06:07:10.150 --> 06:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
i don't mean to run but i've got another
 
06:07:16.788 --> 06:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:18.788 --> 06:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for for having me
 
06:07:21.190 --> 06:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
speak my name is nick norman
 
06:07:21.200 --> 06:07:22.070 align:start position:0%
speak my name is nick norman
and

06:07:22.070 --> 06:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:07:24.470 --> 06:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
i am an advocate for
 
06:07:27.270 --> 06:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
landlords i follow landlord-tenant law
 
06:07:29.190 --> 06:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
06:07:31.110 --> 06:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
i'm a government i am the government
 
06:07:32.708 --> 06:07:32.718 align:start position:0%
chair for the apartment association of
 
06:07:34.470 --> 06:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:07:38.230 --> 06:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
and personally i own 48 units and i've
 
06:07:40.628 --> 06:07:40.638 align:start position:0%
been involved as a landlord for about 35
 
06:07:42.310 --> 06:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
years here in new hampshire
 
06:07:44.230 --> 06:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
our legislative update that follows all
 
06:07:46.470 --> 06:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
new bills goes out to about
 
06:07:49.270 --> 06:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
maybe 2500 or so landlords across the
 
06:07:52.390 --> 06:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
state so i'm very connected into
 
06:07:55.270 --> 06:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant law and the landlord
 
06:07:58.230 --> 06:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
side advocating for landlords
 
06:08:00.470 --> 06:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
i don't have a lot to say on this bill
 
06:08:03.270 --> 06:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
and i don't quite fully understand
 
06:08:06.150 --> 06:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
everything that max was presenting
 
06:08:06.160 --> 06:08:07.270 align:start position:0%
everything that max was presenting
particularly

06:08:07.270 --> 06:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
06:08:09.270 --> 06:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
how it's business friendly
 
06:08:12.230 --> 06:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
to raise property taxes on businesses
 
06:08:14.868 --> 06:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
our concern is that it seems like this
 
06:08:16.868 --> 06:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
is a slippery slope
 
06:08:18.948 --> 06:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
if you begin to have
 
06:08:22.070 --> 06:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
a different tax rate for residential and
 
06:08:24.070 --> 06:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
a different tax rate for commercial does
 
06:08:25.910 --> 06:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
that mean we're leaning towards well now
 
06:08:27.590 --> 06:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
why don't we have a separate tax rate
 
06:08:29.590 --> 06:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
for multi-family owners
 
06:08:31.590 --> 06:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
and other categories we're just
 
06:08:33.670 --> 06:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
concerned that this is
 
06:08:35.670 --> 06:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
a real slippery slope of what could
 
06:08:37.510 --> 06:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
happen in the future it could be the the
 
06:08:40.310 --> 06:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
opening of a door into a really bad
 
06:08:40.320 --> 06:08:41.750 align:start position:0%
opening of a door into a really bad
situation

06:08:41.750 --> 06:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
situation
 
06:08:43.830 --> 06:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
in the rental housing
 
06:08:43.840 --> 06:08:44.948 align:start position:0%
in the rental housing
industry

06:08:44.948 --> 06:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
industry
 
06:08:47.750 --> 06:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
and we're very very concerned about
 
06:08:49.750 --> 06:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and anything that
 
06:08:52.628 --> 06:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
increases the cost of managing
 
06:08:52.638 --> 06:08:53.670 align:start position:0%
increases the cost of managing
running

06:08:53.670 --> 06:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
running
 
06:08:55.590 --> 06:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
rental property
 
06:08:58.310 --> 06:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
so that that's really my only point
 
06:09:00.948 --> 06:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't say anything about that
 
06:09:02.708 --> 06:09:02.718 align:start position:0%
right now
 
06:09:05.590 --> 06:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
it only says we want to be able to raise
 
06:09:09.430 --> 06:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
property taxes on commercial
 
06:09:11.030 --> 06:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
but again we
 
06:09:13.750 --> 06:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
fear for what that will lead to
 
06:09:15.750 --> 06:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that
 
06:09:19.350 --> 06:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
the property tax system is already fair
 
06:09:21.670 --> 06:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
you pay based on the value of what you
 
06:09:21.680 --> 06:09:23.190 align:start position:0%
you pay based on the value of what you
own

06:09:23.190 --> 06:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
own
 
06:09:25.510 --> 06:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
so resident i mean commercial properties
 
06:09:27.270 --> 06:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
are already paying
 
06:09:29.270 --> 06:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
a higher amount
 
06:09:29.280 --> 06:09:30.230 align:start position:0%
a higher amount
because

06:09:30.230 --> 06:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:09:32.310 --> 06:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
usually commercial properties are valued
 
06:09:35.430 --> 06:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
higher than residential properties
 
06:09:37.510 --> 06:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to take any questions
 
06:09:40.868 --> 06:09:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:44.788 --> 06:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none we have another speaker
 
06:09:53.670 --> 06:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:55.030 --> 06:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman dolan and
 
06:09:56.628 --> 06:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is catherine
 
06:09:58.150 --> 06:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
heck from the new hampshire municipal
 
06:10:00.310 --> 06:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
association and we are only commenting
 
06:10:03.270 --> 06:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
on this bill we do not have a position
 
06:10:05.190 --> 06:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
we did want to point out that the bill
 
06:10:07.270 --> 06:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
is written does raise some question on
 
06:10:09.430 --> 06:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
how the division of tax rates might work
 
06:10:12.150 --> 06:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
on a practical level both from assessing
 
06:10:14.708 --> 06:10:14.718 align:start position:0%
and from setting the tax rate so talking
 
06:10:16.708 --> 06:10:16.718 align:start position:0%
about our assessors our tax collectors
 
06:10:19.270 --> 06:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
and the dra as currently we do not have
 
06:10:21.910 --> 06:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
provisions in our software or forms to
 
06:10:23.590 --> 06:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
set to tax rates so that's one
 
06:10:23.600 --> 06:10:25.270 align:start position:0%
set to tax rates so that's one
consideration

06:10:25.270 --> 06:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
06:10:27.670 --> 06:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
however what i did want to touch on was
 
06:10:29.670 --> 06:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
what we know from other states that
 
06:10:31.830 --> 06:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
allow for a local option which we do
 
06:10:34.150 --> 06:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate it's a local option when they
 
06:10:36.150 --> 06:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
adopt a tax scheme that is intended to
 
06:10:38.310 --> 06:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
shift the burden from
 
06:10:40.948 --> 06:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
residential to commercial industrial is
 
06:10:43.110 --> 06:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
that there is an unintended consequence
 
06:10:45.670 --> 06:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
over time it does seem like a short-term
 
06:10:48.948 --> 06:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
policy solution however we've heard from
 
06:10:50.948 --> 06:10:50.958 align:start position:0%
other states that have similar tax
 
06:10:53.670 --> 06:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
systems that are adopted locally that
 
06:10:56.310 --> 06:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
what happens is costs are then passed on
 
06:10:57.670 --> 06:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
to the tenants
 
06:10:59.430 --> 06:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
once the tenants have to pay more they
 
06:11:01.910 --> 06:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
tend to leave so then they move to the
 
06:11:03.350 --> 06:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
next town and they find another
 
06:11:05.350 --> 06:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
community who has not adopted this
 
06:11:05.360 --> 06:11:06.548 align:start position:0%
community who has not adopted this
provision

06:11:06.548 --> 06:11:06.558 align:start position:0%
provision
 
06:11:08.788 --> 06:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
so in the long run this actually hurts
 
06:11:11.590 --> 06:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
the community so imagine in 10 years or
 
06:11:13.190 --> 06:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
15 years that
 
06:11:14.708 --> 06:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
piece of property that was once a
 
06:11:17.430 --> 06:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
vibrant business now is
 
06:11:18.708 --> 06:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
falling apart
 
06:11:20.868 --> 06:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
it has decreased the value of the entire
 
06:11:22.788 --> 06:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
neighborhood because it's unkept perhaps
 
06:11:25.190 --> 06:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's gone defunct and is now
 
06:11:27.590 --> 06:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know taken by tax deed so now the
 
06:11:29.910 --> 06:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
town is getting no dollars from that so
 
06:11:31.270 --> 06:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
we have seen
 
06:11:32.948 --> 06:11:32.958 align:start position:0%
from our neighbors just to the south who
 
06:11:35.110 --> 06:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
have the scheme they
 
06:11:37.510 --> 06:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
do not recommend that it's a long-term
 
06:11:40.310 --> 06:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
policy solution so while i appreciate
 
06:11:42.788 --> 06:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
that there's three years written into
 
06:11:44.708 --> 06:11:44.718 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
06:11:44.718 --> 06:11:45.590 align:start position:0%
this particular
bill

06:11:45.590 --> 06:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:11:47.750 --> 06:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
that it would lapse it appears in three
 
06:11:49.670 --> 06:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
years there's nothing to say that a
 
06:11:51.350 --> 06:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
petition warrant article won't come
 
06:11:53.270 --> 06:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
forward because the
 
06:11:55.350 --> 06:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
residential taxpayer is paying less
 
06:11:57.590 --> 06:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
money regardless of what it's doing to
 
06:12:00.310 --> 06:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
the economy of that town
 
06:12:03.270 --> 06:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
so we did want you to perhaps consider
 
06:12:05.590 --> 06:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
the long-term economic impact of this
 
06:12:08.150 --> 06:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
legislation as you deliberate this bill
 
06:12:08.160 --> 06:12:09.590 align:start position:0%
legislation as you deliberate this bill
additionally

06:12:09.590 --> 06:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
06:12:11.590 --> 06:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire's constitution we would
 
06:12:13.990 --> 06:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
like to point out article 5 that tax
 
06:12:14.000 --> 06:12:14.868 align:start position:0%
like to point out article 5 that tax
rates

06:12:14.868 --> 06:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
rates
 
06:12:18.788 --> 06:12:18.798 align:start position:0%
have to be proportionally assessed so
 
06:12:22.150 --> 06:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
whether reasonable and proportional
 
06:12:25.030 --> 06:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
become unconstitutional in this case we
 
06:12:26.708 --> 06:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
don't have a legal opinion on but that's
 
06:12:27.750 --> 06:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
something that you might want to
 
06:12:29.830 --> 06:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
consider as well and i will take any
 
06:12:31.590 --> 06:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
questions that you have
 
06:12:34.150 --> 06:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
questions from
 
06:12:34.160 --> 06:12:36.628 align:start position:0%
questions from
eric

06:12:36.628 --> 06:12:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:39.510 --> 06:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned in your testimony that
 
06:12:43.190 --> 06:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
there are some other states that have
 
06:12:45.990 --> 06:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
laws like this with local options for
 
06:12:47.910 --> 06:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
different rates could you list some of
 
06:12:50.788 --> 06:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
those states for us so if we wanted to
 
06:12:52.788 --> 06:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
look into
 
06:12:56.150 --> 06:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
how they implement it sure massachusetts
 
06:12:57.670 --> 06:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
new jersey
 
06:13:00.070 --> 06:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
to to name two that are um in new
 
06:13:02.948 --> 06:13:02.958 align:start position:0%
england that's more closer to how we we
 
06:13:04.628 --> 06:13:04.638 align:start position:0%
operate because they do local property
 
06:13:10.868 --> 06:13:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:10.878 --> 06:13:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:13:13.510 --> 06:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:17.030 --> 06:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you ms x for
 
06:13:20.070 --> 06:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question in other states that
 
06:13:22.390 --> 06:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
have similar laws
 
06:13:24.708 --> 06:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
don't they also have prop
 
06:13:28.390 --> 06:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
income tax and sales tax and other taxes
 
06:13:31.670 --> 06:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
that is offsetting the revenue
 
06:13:33.430 --> 06:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
yes those states do have those other
 
06:13:34.830 --> 06:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
taxes that's
 
06:13:37.110 --> 06:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
correct for quick follow-up
 
06:13:39.830 --> 06:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
so that would be not comparing apples to
 
06:13:42.470 --> 06:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
apple apples to orange isn't it
 
06:13:45.350 --> 06:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
well we're talking about property tax so
 
06:13:48.070 --> 06:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
they assess their property tax at a
 
06:13:50.230 --> 06:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
different rate in those states they have
 
06:13:51.830 --> 06:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
different tax schemes
 
06:13:54.070 --> 06:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
so what happens is it drives businesses
 
06:13:56.230 --> 06:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
out of one town and they move to a town
 
06:13:58.708 --> 06:13:58.718 align:start position:0%
that has not adopted these provisions
 
06:13:58.718 --> 06:13:59.590 align:start position:0%
that has not adopted these provisions
so

06:13:59.590 --> 06:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:14:01.670 --> 06:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
i would say on the taxing side of the
 
06:14:03.990 --> 06:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
property tax bill it probably is the
 
06:14:06.070 --> 06:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
same because they're paying income tax
 
06:14:07.750 --> 06:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
and sales tax in that state if they
 
06:14:09.590 --> 06:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
remain regardless of where they're
 
06:14:09.600 --> 06:14:10.628 align:start position:0%
remain regardless of where they're
physically

06:14:10.628 --> 06:14:10.638 align:start position:0%
physically
 
06:14:12.470 --> 06:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
located within the geography of that
 
06:14:12.480 --> 06:14:13.510 align:start position:0%
located within the geography of that
state

06:14:13.510 --> 06:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:14:17.270 --> 06:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
so um i understand but with that uh
 
06:14:19.510 --> 06:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
you know because we don't have any other
 
06:14:19.520 --> 06:14:20.948 align:start position:0%
you know because we don't have any other
revenues

06:14:20.948 --> 06:14:20.958 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
06:14:22.788 --> 06:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
this may not just
 
06:14:25.670 --> 06:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know to move the businesses out
 
06:14:26.788 --> 06:14:26.798 align:start position:0%
of that
 
06:14:27.990 --> 06:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
town or
 
06:14:28.000 --> 06:14:29.190 align:start position:0%
town or
um

06:14:29.190 --> 06:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:33.670 --> 06:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
but maybe out of the state altogether
 
06:14:35.110 --> 06:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
06:14:40.628 --> 06:14:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:40.638 --> 06:14:43.270 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:14:43.270 --> 06:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:46.548 --> 06:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
06:14:49.750 --> 06:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
tax policy has a dramatic effect on
 
06:14:49.760 --> 06:14:51.270 align:start position:0%
tax policy has a dramatic effect on
business

06:14:51.270 --> 06:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
business
 
06:14:53.190 --> 06:14:53.200 align:start position:0%
i've been told
 
06:14:55.590 --> 06:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
that with the
 
06:14:57.990 --> 06:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
proliferation of
 
06:15:02.310 --> 06:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
malls along our southern border
 
06:15:06.150 --> 06:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
that they all have a provision
 
06:15:07.910 --> 06:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
in their leases
 
06:15:11.430 --> 06:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
that if there is ever a sales tax
 
06:15:14.390 --> 06:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
enacted in the state of new hampshire
 
06:15:17.750 --> 06:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
that their leases will be null and void
 
06:15:19.670 --> 06:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
do you know if that's true
 
06:15:22.310 --> 06:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
i do not know if that's true
 
06:15:24.150 --> 06:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:15:26.830 --> 06:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions for
 
06:15:26.840 --> 06:15:28.390 align:start position:0%
any other questions for
nhma

06:15:28.390 --> 06:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
nhma
 
06:15:29.750 --> 06:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
06:15:30.628 --> 06:15:30.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:15:32.310 --> 06:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:15:55.510 --> 06:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:59.190 --> 06:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:00.708 --> 06:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
06:16:03.670 --> 06:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is dave
 
06:16:05.670 --> 06:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
giuve i'm a senior vice president for
 
06:16:07.190 --> 06:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
public policy
 
06:16:08.948 --> 06:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
for the business and industry
 
06:16:08.958 --> 06:16:10.390 align:start position:0%
for the business and industry
association

06:16:10.390 --> 06:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
association
 
06:16:12.310 --> 06:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
we serve as new hampshire statewide
 
06:16:13.990 --> 06:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
chamber of commerce we have
 
06:16:17.990 --> 06:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 400 plus employers with
 
06:16:19.750 --> 06:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
over 80 000
 
06:16:21.990 --> 06:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
employees here in the state
 
06:16:23.670 --> 06:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
so i represent the people that would be
 
06:16:26.548 --> 06:16:26.558 align:start position:0%
most impacted by this legislation
 
06:16:29.030 --> 06:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
and although i tried to do the mental
 
06:16:32.310 --> 06:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
gymnastics on how raising taxes
 
06:16:34.868 --> 06:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
on a business is business friendly i was
 
06:16:39.030 --> 06:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
not able to figure that one out uh but i
 
06:16:40.470 --> 06:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
encourage all of you to go to the
 
06:16:42.628 --> 06:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
employers in your communities and ask
 
06:16:45.030 --> 06:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
them that i think the answer will be
 
06:16:47.270 --> 06:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
different than uh those received by the
 
06:16:50.708 --> 06:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor uh mr chair i'll keep my
 
06:16:53.350 --> 06:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
comments very short but i just want to
 
06:16:55.910 --> 06:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
put this proposal in the context of
 
06:16:57.830 --> 06:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
what's going on with employers in the
 
06:16:59.430 --> 06:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
state right now
 
06:17:01.510 --> 06:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
right now in new hampshire because of
 
06:17:01.520 --> 06:17:02.230 align:start position:0%
right now in new hampshire because of
our

06:17:02.230 --> 06:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
our
 
06:17:04.310 --> 06:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
unique tax structure
 
06:17:06.948 --> 06:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
business taxes are among the highest of
 
06:17:09.910 --> 06:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
any state in the country our business
 
06:17:11.830 --> 06:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax is unique to new
 
06:17:13.830 --> 06:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire we can't even compare that to
 
06:17:15.990 --> 06:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
other states because no other state has
 
06:17:16.000 --> 06:17:17.350 align:start position:0%
other states because no other state has
it

06:17:17.350 --> 06:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:17:17.360 --> 06:17:18.868 align:start position:0%
it
similarly

06:17:18.868 --> 06:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
similarly
 
06:17:21.110 --> 06:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
property taxes are high here and i
 
06:17:23.750 --> 06:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
simply i'm i'm a property taxpayer
 
06:17:26.310 --> 06:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
you're probably all property taxpayers
 
06:17:27.670 --> 06:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
probably everybody in the room is a
 
06:17:29.670 --> 06:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer we understand that
 
06:17:31.270 --> 06:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
06:17:32.548 --> 06:17:32.558 align:start position:0%
are high
 
06:17:35.030 --> 06:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
but there is the benefit here that we
 
06:17:37.590 --> 06:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
also often talk about about not having
 
06:17:39.990 --> 06:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
an income tax on new hampshire sourced
 
06:17:42.230 --> 06:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
income or a general sales tax so there
 
06:17:44.070 --> 06:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
is a counterbalance
 
06:17:46.230 --> 06:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
businesses are not only paying those
 
06:17:48.230 --> 06:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
high business taxes but they're already
 
06:17:50.390 --> 06:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
paying high property taxes just like
 
06:17:51.910 --> 06:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
everyone else
 
06:17:54.150 --> 06:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
this bill which is designed to shift the
 
06:17:56.470 --> 06:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
property tax burden to employers will
 
06:17:58.628 --> 06:17:58.638 align:start position:0%
make that even worse
 
06:18:00.470 --> 06:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
these are employers right now around the
 
06:18:02.708 --> 06:18:02.718 align:start position:0%
state who are already struggling because
 
06:18:05.270 --> 06:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
they're having a hard time finding labor
 
06:18:08.548 --> 06:18:08.558 align:start position:0%
they're already struggling uh because of
 
06:18:10.470 --> 06:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
the ramifications of the coveted
 
06:18:12.788 --> 06:18:12.798 align:start position:0%
pandemic either
 
06:18:15.030 --> 06:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
having a direct impact on their business
 
06:18:18.708 --> 06:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
and in terms of employee absenteeism or
 
06:18:21.430 --> 06:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
what's more likely happening a reduction
 
06:18:23.830 --> 06:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
in business if you're a hotel or a
 
06:18:23.840 --> 06:18:25.110 align:start position:0%
in business if you're a hotel or a
restaurant

06:18:25.110 --> 06:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
06:18:27.030 --> 06:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
you're seeing the people coming into
 
06:18:29.350 --> 06:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
your business at about 50 percent of
 
06:18:32.150 --> 06:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
what it was pre-covered so it's not like
 
06:18:35.430 --> 06:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of extra revenue to to
 
06:18:38.548 --> 06:18:38.558 align:start position:0%
give back in a way this proposal
 
06:18:38.558 --> 06:18:39.670 align:start position:0%
give back in a way this proposal
suggests

06:18:39.670 --> 06:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
suggests
 
06:18:41.830 --> 06:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
we're happy to do our part in
 
06:18:44.150 --> 06:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
communities and pay our property taxes
 
06:18:45.990 --> 06:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
because we benefit from the fire
 
06:18:48.230 --> 06:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
departments and the police departments
 
06:18:50.628 --> 06:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
in the good educational systems those
 
06:18:53.110 --> 06:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
are all important to our businesses
 
06:18:54.948 --> 06:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
but please
 
06:18:56.788 --> 06:18:56.798 align:start position:0%
think long and hard about doing
 
06:18:59.910 --> 06:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
something that is as unfair is what this
 
06:19:02.070 --> 06:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
bill suggests thank you mr chair i'd be
 
06:19:03.590 --> 06:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions any
 
06:19:03.600 --> 06:19:06.310 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions any
questions

06:19:06.310 --> 06:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:10.070 --> 06:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:10.080 --> 06:19:11.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:19:11.430 --> 06:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:19:14.150 --> 06:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
um with you mentioning businesses having
 
06:19:16.548 --> 06:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
a hard time finding people
 
06:19:19.510 --> 06:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
to fill jobs isn't part of the reason
 
06:19:21.750 --> 06:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
for that due to the
 
06:19:23.270 --> 06:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
housing shortage
 
06:19:24.548 --> 06:19:24.558 align:start position:0%
we have so
 
06:19:27.430 --> 06:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
when making housing more affordable by
 
06:19:29.430 --> 06:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
having their property taxes be lower
 
06:19:29.440 --> 06:19:30.390 align:start position:0%
having their property taxes be lower
help

06:19:30.390 --> 06:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
help
 
06:19:32.390 --> 06:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
those businesses find more people to
 
06:19:35.670 --> 06:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:35.680 --> 06:19:37.030 align:start position:0%
 
well

06:19:37.030 --> 06:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:19:41.350 --> 06:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
bia has long been involved in uh
 
06:19:43.430 --> 06:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
workforce housing issues i've appeared
 
06:19:44.948 --> 06:19:44.958 align:start position:0%
before this committee this session on
 
06:19:46.868 --> 06:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
workforce housing bills
 
06:19:49.110 --> 06:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
um and certainly we're concerned about
 
06:19:49.120 --> 06:19:49.830 align:start position:0%
um and certainly we're concerned about
the

06:19:49.830 --> 06:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:19:52.230 --> 06:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
availability and affordability of
 
06:19:52.240 --> 06:19:55.030 align:start position:0%
availability and affordability of
housing

06:19:55.030 --> 06:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:57.430 --> 06:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
i believe it's a bit of a stretch
 
06:20:00.468 --> 06:20:00.478 align:start position:0%
to suggest that an individual who isn't
 
06:20:02.708 --> 06:20:02.718 align:start position:0%
able to afford a house now would somehow
 
06:20:05.430 --> 06:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
be able to afford it if this legislation
 
06:20:07.670 --> 06:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
passed and i would add that there are
 
06:20:10.070 --> 06:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
also a lot of other factors
 
06:20:11.670 --> 06:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
that are making it difficult for
 
06:20:13.990 --> 06:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
employers to find work it's not just
 
06:20:14.000 --> 06:20:15.910 align:start position:0%
employers to find work it's not just
housing

06:20:15.910 --> 06:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
housing
 
06:20:25.030 --> 06:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:27.910 --> 06:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr for
 
06:20:30.708 --> 06:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
zouay for taking my question
 
06:20:30.718 --> 06:20:32.468 align:start position:0%
zouay for taking my question
um

06:20:32.468 --> 06:20:32.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:34.390 --> 06:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
something caught my attention in your
 
06:20:37.150 --> 06:20:37.160 align:start position:0%
statement you said
 
06:20:37.160 --> 06:20:38.708 align:start position:0%
statement you said
education

06:20:38.708 --> 06:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
education
 
06:20:40.948 --> 06:20:40.958 align:start position:0%
and workforce
 
06:20:44.868 --> 06:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:47.350 --> 06:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
don't you think that having good
 
06:20:49.190 --> 06:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
workforce providing all the
 
06:20:49.200 --> 06:20:50.548 align:start position:0%
workforce providing all the
infrastructure

06:20:50.548 --> 06:20:50.558 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
06:20:54.310 --> 06:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of education roads and fire is
 
06:20:57.670 --> 06:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
critical for a driving community in that
 
06:21:00.948 --> 06:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
case you know the
 
06:21:00.958 --> 06:21:02.230 align:start position:0%
case you know the
taxes

06:21:02.230 --> 06:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
06:21:04.708 --> 06:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
or the revenue for the
 
06:21:07.990 --> 06:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities and it benefits both
 
06:21:10.390 --> 06:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
businesses as well as the residential
 
06:21:10.400 --> 06:21:11.670 align:start position:0%
businesses as well as the residential
communities

06:21:11.670 --> 06:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
communities
 
06:21:14.628 --> 06:21:14.638 align:start position:0%
just by cutting taxes we are not going
 
06:21:17.030 --> 06:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah or shifting burden from one to
 
06:21:19.350 --> 06:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
other we are not going to enhance the
 
06:21:21.510 --> 06:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
growth of the community
 
06:21:23.990 --> 06:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question um i'd
 
06:21:25.510 --> 06:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
like to make two points one we're not
 
06:21:27.190 --> 06:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
talking about cutting taxes here we're
 
06:21:30.628 --> 06:21:30.638 align:start position:0%
talking about shifting the burden to uh
 
06:21:32.708 --> 06:21:32.718 align:start position:0%
employers in your community
 
06:21:36.390 --> 06:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
which i'm opposed to i want to emphasize
 
06:21:38.708 --> 06:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
the importance of education and
 
06:21:40.868 --> 06:21:40.878 align:start position:0%
especially our public education system
 
06:21:43.110 --> 06:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
which is where most of our
 
06:21:45.750 --> 06:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
employees and future employees come from
 
06:21:47.350 --> 06:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
and the importance
 
06:21:49.590 --> 06:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
of making sure that those in educational
 
06:21:52.548 --> 06:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
institutions are funded appropriately
 
06:21:54.868 --> 06:21:54.878 align:start position:0%
which most businesses around the state
 
06:21:56.788 --> 06:21:56.798 align:start position:0%
at least the ones i work with are more
 
06:21:58.548 --> 06:21:58.558 align:start position:0%
than happy to do because they recognize
 
06:22:02.150 --> 06:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:04.468 --> 06:22:04.478 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
06:22:06.310 --> 06:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and and thank you
 
06:22:07.590 --> 06:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
mr duvet for
 
06:22:09.270 --> 06:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
taking uh my question
 
06:22:09.280 --> 06:22:11.910 align:start position:0%
taking uh my question
um

06:22:11.910 --> 06:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:13.990 --> 06:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
based on on your knowledge of the
 
06:22:15.510 --> 06:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
business obviously you've been in for
 
06:22:17.510 --> 06:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
the bia for a very very long time it
 
06:22:20.390 --> 06:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
seems like a long time
 
06:22:22.230 --> 06:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
i first met you in your office and had a
 
06:22:23.670 --> 06:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
conversation with you about business
 
06:22:25.590 --> 06:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
taxes but um
 
06:22:25.600 --> 06:22:26.390 align:start position:0%
taxes but um
the

06:22:26.390 --> 06:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:22:29.830 --> 06:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
my question is do you feel that
 
06:22:32.230 --> 06:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
um smaller business or maybe even larger
 
06:22:32.240 --> 06:22:33.430 align:start position:0%
um smaller business or maybe even larger
businesses

06:22:33.430 --> 06:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
06:22:35.910 --> 06:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
might pick up from a community that puts
 
06:22:36.788 --> 06:22:36.798 align:start position:0%
us in
 
06:22:38.948 --> 06:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
and go next door to a community that may
 
06:22:40.708 --> 06:22:40.718 align:start position:0%
not i know that's a big burden for them
 
06:22:43.270 --> 06:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
to pick up and move but do you think
 
06:22:45.030 --> 06:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
that something like that could possibly
 
06:22:47.110 --> 06:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
happen and potentially shift the burden
 
06:22:48.788 --> 06:22:48.798 align:start position:0%
back to residents because now it becomes
 
06:22:51.750 --> 06:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
90 well i want to be honest with you the
 
06:22:54.708 --> 06:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
likelihood of a company like uh fidelity
 
06:22:58.230 --> 06:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
was mentioned in anheuser-busch and um
 
06:23:00.868 --> 06:23:00.878 align:start position:0%
the uh nuclear power plant
 
06:23:03.990 --> 06:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh the likelihood or hospitals the
 
06:23:05.750 --> 06:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
likelihood of those businesses picking
 
06:23:08.708 --> 06:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
up and moving is is not likely at all i
 
06:23:10.548 --> 06:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
do think there's a potential for
 
06:23:12.868 --> 06:23:12.878 align:start position:0%
mischief with smaller
 
06:23:15.270 --> 06:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh companies you're you're
 
06:23:16.948 --> 06:23:16.958 align:start position:0%
calling mom and pop shops that may be
 
06:23:18.628 --> 06:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
unfair but but you all know what i'm
 
06:23:21.270 --> 06:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
talking about smaller smaller businesses
 
06:23:23.990 --> 06:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
where it's quite easy to to pick up and
 
06:23:24.000 --> 06:23:25.030 align:start position:0%
where it's quite easy to to pick up and
move

06:23:25.030 --> 06:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
move
 
06:23:27.910 --> 06:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
to another community
 
06:23:30.310 --> 06:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
i think there is some potential for that
 
06:23:32.150 --> 06:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
and i think with even with the larger
 
06:23:34.948 --> 06:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
companies that aren't likely to move
 
06:23:37.270 --> 06:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
this may impact other decisions that
 
06:23:39.990 --> 06:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
they're making in terms of hiring so
 
06:23:40.000 --> 06:23:40.868 align:start position:0%
they're making in terms of hiring so
i

06:23:40.868 --> 06:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:23:43.030 --> 06:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
i think there's i think a proposal like
 
06:23:43.040 --> 06:23:44.548 align:start position:0%
i think there's i think a proposal like
this

06:23:44.548 --> 06:23:44.558 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:23:47.430 --> 06:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
has um we've all heard about unintended
 
06:23:49.190 --> 06:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
consequences and i think there could be
 
06:23:51.670 --> 06:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of mischief that would come from a
 
06:23:54.230 --> 06:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
bill like this becoming law
 
06:23:55.590 --> 06:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:23:57.750 --> 06:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
06:23:59.190 --> 06:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
06:24:01.270 --> 06:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned
 
06:24:04.708 --> 06:24:04.718 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
06:24:07.750 --> 06:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
in the um prime sponsor he focused a lot
 
06:24:10.310 --> 06:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
on the seabrook nuclear power nuclear
 
06:24:10.320 --> 06:24:11.430 align:start position:0%
on the seabrook nuclear power nuclear
station

06:24:11.430 --> 06:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
station
 
06:24:14.948 --> 06:24:14.958 align:start position:0%
do you think that if this were to become
 
06:24:18.510 --> 06:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
law in some communities who had
 
06:24:20.948 --> 06:24:20.958 align:start position:0%
non-residential property that was a
 
06:24:23.110 --> 06:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
power generator
 
06:24:25.190 --> 06:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
that now would have to be paying more in
 
06:24:28.230 --> 06:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
property taxes that that might result in
 
06:24:30.788 --> 06:24:30.798 align:start position:0%
higher energy costs for business which i
 
06:24:32.548 --> 06:24:32.558 align:start position:0%
know is a big consideration in new
 
06:24:34.628 --> 06:24:34.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire many businesses
 
06:24:36.948 --> 06:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
cite high energy costs
 
06:24:38.230 --> 06:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
um in
 
06:24:40.468 --> 06:24:40.478 align:start position:0%
you know as a problem for their business
 
06:24:42.070 --> 06:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
do you so do you think this bill would
 
06:24:42.080 --> 06:24:43.030 align:start position:0%
do you so do you think this bill would
even

06:24:43.030 --> 06:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
even
 
06:24:45.110 --> 06:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
raise the cost for businesses even
 
06:24:45.120 --> 06:24:46.468 align:start position:0%
raise the cost for businesses even
further

06:24:46.468 --> 06:24:46.478 align:start position:0%
further
 
06:24:48.310 --> 06:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
i think it has potential for raising
 
06:24:50.150 --> 06:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
electricity costs for everybody
 
06:24:50.160 --> 06:24:51.750 align:start position:0%
electricity costs for everybody
residential

06:24:51.750 --> 06:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
residential
 
06:24:54.390 --> 06:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
individuals and other businesses
 
06:24:55.750 --> 06:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
electricity rates as i'm sure you're
 
06:24:58.070 --> 06:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
aware established by the puc and when a
 
06:25:01.190 --> 06:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
rate request is requested or when a rate
 
06:25:03.030 --> 06:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
request is made
 
06:25:05.910 --> 06:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
the utility has to provide justification
 
06:25:09.030 --> 06:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
for for the rate uh increase and i
 
06:25:12.230 --> 06:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
guarantee you that if their uh taxes are
 
06:25:14.070 --> 06:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
going up significantly that is something
 
06:25:16.070 --> 06:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
that they would use as is part of a
 
06:25:19.430 --> 06:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
justification thank you
 
06:25:21.830 --> 06:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
06:25:24.070 --> 06:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you mr
 
06:25:25.670 --> 06:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
gervais taking my question i think
 
06:25:27.510 --> 06:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully this is an easy one
 
06:25:31.110 --> 06:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
does the bia have statistics on how many
 
06:25:33.270 --> 06:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh businesses
 
06:25:36.150 --> 06:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
are also or how many business owners
 
06:25:37.830 --> 06:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
actually live in the communities for
 
06:25:39.670 --> 06:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
which they have their businesses uh and
 
06:25:40.868 --> 06:25:40.878 align:start position:0%
i don't need the answer now i'm just
 
06:25:43.430 --> 06:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
curious because the sponsor said that a
 
06:25:45.670 --> 06:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
lot of those people but you know is that
 
06:25:47.510 --> 06:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
true i know it's not in northampton that
 
06:25:49.670 --> 06:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
is not the case in northampton
 
06:25:52.310 --> 06:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have those statistics and
 
06:25:53.350 --> 06:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
06:25:55.190 --> 06:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
it would it would take an exhaustive
 
06:25:56.948 --> 06:25:56.958 align:start position:0%
study to come up with them but i think
 
06:25:59.350 --> 06:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
you raised a good point
 
06:25:59.360 --> 06:26:00.310 align:start position:0%
you raised a good point
that

06:26:00.310 --> 06:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:26:02.390 --> 06:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
just because you run a business in the
 
06:26:02.400 --> 06:26:03.510 align:start position:0%
just because you run a business in the
community

06:26:03.510 --> 06:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:26:05.110 --> 06:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it's a large
 
06:26:07.430 --> 06:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
business or a small business it doesn't
 
06:26:09.430 --> 06:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean you live there but even
 
06:26:10.788 --> 06:26:10.798 align:start position:0%
if you did
 
06:26:12.868 --> 06:26:12.878 align:start position:0%
he made the point about
 
06:26:12.878 --> 06:26:14.548 align:start position:0%
he made the point about
um

06:26:14.548 --> 06:26:14.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:16.548 --> 06:26:16.558 align:start position:0%
his the businesses he talked to being
 
06:26:18.390 --> 06:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
supportive of this because they saw the
 
06:26:21.110 --> 06:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
potential for their their home property
 
06:26:23.270 --> 06:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
tax to go down even if their business
 
06:26:25.830 --> 06:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
property tax went up but we're kind of
 
06:26:27.350 --> 06:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
talking about two different things the
 
06:26:29.750 --> 06:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
home property tax is a personal expense
 
06:26:32.390 --> 06:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
that we all pay the business property
 
06:26:34.468 --> 06:26:34.478 align:start position:0%
tax is a business expense which is
 
06:26:34.478 --> 06:26:35.670 align:start position:0%
tax is a business expense which is
deductible

06:26:35.670 --> 06:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
deductible
 
06:26:37.750 --> 06:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
um as a part of your your business
 
06:26:39.830 --> 06:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
return the business is paying for it the
 
06:26:43.350 --> 06:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:44.868 --> 06:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
hey uh the
 
06:26:44.878 --> 06:26:46.708 align:start position:0%
hey uh the
remote

06:26:46.708 --> 06:26:46.718 align:start position:0%

06:26:52.718 --> 06:26:54.390 align:start position:0%
people support it and five people oppose
it

06:26:54.390 --> 06:26:54.400 align:start position:0%

yeah when i if i'm
 
06:37:31.590 --> 06:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
if someone's coming behind me
 
06:37:33.110 --> 06:37:33.120 align:start position:0%

at a school district meeting may adopt
 
06:40:32.390 --> 06:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
the school district budget cap by a

the warren article to adopt this budget
 
06:40:41.670 --> 06:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
cap specifies a gross cost per student
 
06:40:43.990 --> 06:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
as well as an annual inflation
 
06:40:45.910 --> 06:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
adjustment factor
 
06:40:48.868 --> 06:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
the inflation inflation adjustment
 
06:40:50.868 --> 06:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
factor can be
 
06:40:53.750 --> 06:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
a fixed percentage or an index from the
 
06:40:57.430 --> 06:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
united states bureau of labor statistics
 
06:41:01.110 --> 06:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
such as the consumer price index for all
 
06:41:02.948 --> 06:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
urban consumers
 
06:41:02.958 --> 06:41:03.910 align:start position:0%
urban consumers
or

06:41:03.910 --> 06:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:41:05.750 --> 06:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
for example the
 
06:41:09.030 --> 06:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
employment cost index annually the
 
06:41:09.040 --> 06:41:10.230 align:start position:0%
employment cost index annually the
school

06:41:10.230 --> 06:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:41:13.270 --> 06:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
district budget cap is determined
 
06:41:15.510 --> 06:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
by multiplying the gross dollar amount
 
06:41:16.788 --> 06:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
per student
 
06:41:19.350 --> 06:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
by the student enrollment which is
 
06:41:22.230 --> 06:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
defined as a school district average
 
06:41:25.270 --> 06:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
daily membership as of the previous
 
06:41:27.110 --> 06:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
october first
 
06:41:29.350 --> 06:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
this figure is then multiplied by the
 
06:41:29.360 --> 06:41:30.310 align:start position:0%
this figure is then multiplied by the
annual

06:41:30.310 --> 06:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
annual
 
06:41:33.030 --> 06:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
inflation adjustment factor to yield the
 
06:41:36.788 --> 06:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
budget cap for that fiscal year
 
06:41:38.788 --> 06:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
notably the budget cap will tend to
 
06:41:41.270 --> 06:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
decrease with lower student enrollments
 
06:41:42.948 --> 06:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
and increase with higher student
 
06:41:42.958 --> 06:41:44.468 align:start position:0%
and increase with higher student
enrollments

06:41:44.468 --> 06:41:44.478 align:start position:0%
enrollments
 
06:41:46.868 --> 06:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
at the annual meeting the total proposed
 
06:41:49.190 --> 06:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
spending of all warrant articles
 
06:41:51.190 --> 06:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
presented by the governing body or the
 
06:41:53.910 --> 06:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
budget committee is limited by this
 
06:41:55.750 --> 06:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
budget cap
 
06:41:58.548 --> 06:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
and the legislative body can increase or
 
06:42:00.948 --> 06:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
decrease appropriations in warren
 
06:42:04.230 --> 06:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
articles using the normal procedures
 
06:42:07.430 --> 06:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
however when an appropriation will
 
06:42:10.150 --> 06:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
exceed the budget cap approval to
 
06:42:11.990 --> 06:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
override the budget cap
 
06:42:14.070 --> 06:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
will require a three-fifth
 
06:42:16.070 --> 06:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
super-majority vote
 
06:42:17.670 --> 06:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
a ballot vote
 
06:42:20.390 --> 06:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
requiring this supermajority to override
 
06:42:22.948 --> 06:42:22.958 align:start position:0%
the budget cap ensures that any spending
 
06:42:25.910 --> 06:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
that exceeds the budget cap is in fact
 
06:42:28.468 --> 06:42:28.478 align:start position:0%
warranted and is overwhelmingly
 
06:42:31.510 --> 06:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
supported by the legislative body
 
06:42:33.750 --> 06:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
additionally this bill stipulates that
 
06:42:35.350 --> 06:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
in the case of warrant articles
 
06:42:37.590 --> 06:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
proposing bonds notes or other
 
06:42:39.590 --> 06:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
multi-year expenditures
 
06:42:41.670 --> 06:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
only the first year estimated costs
 
06:42:43.190 --> 06:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
shall be used in calculating
 
06:42:45.030 --> 06:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
appropriations for the purpose of
 
06:42:47.270 --> 06:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
overriding the budget cap
 
06:42:49.510 --> 06:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
this bill also outlines the procedures
 
06:42:51.750 --> 06:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
for overriding the budget cap in a
 
06:42:54.070 --> 06:42:54.080 align:start position:0%

06:44:50.548 --> 06:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members
 
06:44:52.230 --> 06:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
i'm the vice president of the school
 
06:44:54.070 --> 06:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
district governance association and my
 
06:44:57.190 --> 06:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
name is eric power from brookline
 
06:44:58.788 --> 06:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
and what i want to talk about today was
 
06:45:00.868 --> 06:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
06:45:02.390 --> 06:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
the school district governance
 
06:45:05.430 --> 06:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
association or sdga for short is made up
 
06:45:07.190 --> 06:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
of current and former school board and
 
06:45:08.948 --> 06:45:08.958 align:start position:0%
budget committee members from across the
 
06:45:10.468 --> 06:45:10.478 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
06:45:13.190 --> 06:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's a whole volunteer organization
 
06:45:15.270 --> 06:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
myself i am a former
 
06:45:16.628 --> 06:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
school board member in the hollis
 
06:45:18.230 --> 06:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
brookline cooperative school district
 
06:45:21.110 --> 06:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
served there for three years
 
06:45:23.030 --> 06:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
sdga has
 
06:45:25.590 --> 06:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
been was founded to promote educational
 
06:45:27.590 --> 06:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
excellence prudence in budgeting and
 
06:45:29.110 --> 06:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
responsible governance in school
 
06:45:29.120 --> 06:45:30.948 align:start position:0%
responsible governance in school
districts

06:45:30.948 --> 06:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
districts
 
06:45:33.430 --> 06:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
the sdga membership reports that school
 
06:45:35.350 --> 06:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
budgets are increasing faster than
 
06:45:37.510 --> 06:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
inflation across the state
 
06:45:41.350 --> 06:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
despite declining student enrollments
 
06:45:44.150 --> 06:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
i actually was the chair of a budcom
 
06:45:46.628 --> 06:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
study committee in the town of brookline
 
06:45:49.670 --> 06:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
two years ago where we looked at school
 
06:45:51.510 --> 06:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
districts and towns and i'll talk about
 
06:45:53.750 --> 06:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
school districts that's the focus here
 
06:45:56.150 --> 06:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
we looked at 26 peer school districts to
 
06:45:56.160 --> 06:45:57.830 align:start position:0%
we looked at 26 peer school districts to
brookline

06:45:57.830 --> 06:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
brookline
 
06:45:59.990 --> 06:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
and we looked at what they were doing in
 
06:46:01.510 --> 06:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
terms of budgets what was happening and
 
06:46:04.070 --> 06:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
so we normalized it so we looked at
 
06:46:06.310 --> 06:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
essentially took out inflation and took
 
06:46:06.320 --> 06:46:07.990 align:start position:0%
essentially took out inflation and took
out

06:46:07.990 --> 06:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:46:10.150 --> 06:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
the changes in population
 
06:46:13.430 --> 06:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
and we found that 21 of the 27 school
 
06:46:15.510 --> 06:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
districts in this sample
 
06:46:17.670 --> 06:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
had per student costs exceeding
 
06:46:22.070 --> 06:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:24.948 --> 06:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
so it's definitely a problem
 
06:46:26.548 --> 06:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
the other example i think there's a
 
06:46:30.070 --> 06:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
handout here i wanted to point to
 
06:46:31.510 --> 06:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
example student enrollment and
 
06:46:33.110 --> 06:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
appropriations history this is actually
 
06:46:35.030 --> 06:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
from the hollis brookline cooperative
 
06:46:36.868 --> 06:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
school district the blue bars are
 
06:46:38.628 --> 06:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
showing the student enrollment you can
 
06:46:42.230 --> 06:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
see that it peaked in in fy 10 and was
 
06:46:44.390 --> 06:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
going down since that time
 
06:46:46.150 --> 06:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
the red line on there is actually
 
06:46:48.150 --> 06:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
showing the actual appropriations that
 
06:46:50.628 --> 06:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
has been done for the the co-op school
 
06:46:50.638 --> 06:46:51.990 align:start position:0%
has been done for the the co-op school
district

06:46:51.990 --> 06:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
district
 
06:46:53.510 --> 06:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk a little bit in a second
 
06:46:55.990 --> 06:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
but the green line is if you had adopted
 
06:46:58.868 --> 06:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
this school budget district this school
 
06:47:02.708 --> 06:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
budget dis school district budget cap
 
06:47:05.510 --> 06:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
with the cpiu as your
 
06:47:08.310 --> 06:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh inflation index what the cap would
 
06:47:09.910 --> 06:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
have done
 
06:47:12.230 --> 06:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
just so you know is in color we're in
 
06:47:13.910 --> 06:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
black and white up here
 
06:47:13.920 --> 06:47:15.110 align:start position:0%
black and white up here
okay

06:47:15.110 --> 06:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:47:17.350 --> 06:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
the bottom line that you see is the is
 
06:47:18.788 --> 06:47:18.798 align:start position:0%
the green line
 
06:47:20.548 --> 06:47:20.558 align:start position:0%
the top line that's going up almost off
 
06:47:22.070 --> 06:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
the chart is the red line so that's
 
06:47:23.750 --> 06:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's the actual appropriations you see
 
06:47:25.830 --> 06:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
a label on it so you can follow it thank
 
06:47:27.350 --> 06:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
you for letting me know that
 
06:47:29.110 --> 06:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
so this is hypothetical that if you had
 
06:47:30.708 --> 06:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
adopted this we went back in time and
 
06:47:33.350 --> 06:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
said in 2006 what fyo 6 if we had
 
06:47:35.190 --> 06:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
adopted this is what would have happened
 
06:47:37.190 --> 06:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
so you can see despite the declining
 
06:47:39.030 --> 06:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment the budget was allowed to go
 
06:47:40.548 --> 06:47:40.558 align:start position:0%
up it just wasn't allowed to go up quite
 
06:47:42.788 --> 06:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
as fast this is an example how you would
 
06:47:47.270 --> 06:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:47.280 --> 06:47:48.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:47:48.070 --> 06:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:47:50.548 --> 06:47:50.558 align:start position:0%
this the graph the other graph there
 
06:47:54.310 --> 06:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
shows the per student cost the gross
 
06:47:56.070 --> 06:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
cost per student
 
06:47:58.708 --> 06:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
and the taller graph is the actual and
 
06:48:00.788 --> 06:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
the inflation-adjusted one if it had
 
06:48:00.798 --> 06:48:02.150 align:start position:0%
the inflation-adjusted one if it had
stayed

06:48:02.150 --> 06:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
stayed
 
06:48:04.390 --> 06:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
and adjusted with inflation is the is
 
06:48:06.628 --> 06:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
the lower graph
 
06:48:08.708 --> 06:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
so that that kind of shows you here that
 
06:48:10.948 --> 06:48:10.958 align:start position:0%
the uh the increase over this time
 
06:48:13.910 --> 06:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
period was 80 almost 88 percent
 
06:48:16.548 --> 06:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
for the actual first gross
 
06:48:18.948 --> 06:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
the gross cost per student
 
06:48:22.948 --> 06:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
and the cpiu adjusted was only up 43 so
 
06:48:28.310 --> 06:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:29.990 --> 06:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
the budget cap provides a reasonable
 
06:48:31.750 --> 06:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
approach to budgeting
 
06:48:33.830 --> 06:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
the budget clap cap as you've heard
 
06:48:35.590 --> 06:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
includes a dollar figure for gross cost
 
06:48:37.510 --> 06:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
per student and an inflation factor
 
06:48:39.750 --> 06:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
which can be a fixed percentage or u.s
 
06:48:41.750 --> 06:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
government index chosen by the
 
06:48:43.830 --> 06:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
legislative body
 
06:48:45.990 --> 06:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
the budget cap is the gross cost per
 
06:48:47.510 --> 06:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
student times the number of students
 
06:48:49.830 --> 06:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
times the inflation factor calculated
 
06:48:51.430 --> 06:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
every year
 
06:48:53.350 --> 06:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
and it basically adjusts spending based
 
06:48:54.628 --> 06:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
on the number of students and what's
 
06:48:56.868 --> 06:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
happening with inflation
 
06:48:58.628 --> 06:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
small adjustments
 
06:49:00.070 --> 06:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
are going to be generally made over time
 
06:49:03.350 --> 06:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
because populations don't change rapidly
 
06:49:05.750 --> 06:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
and if an urgent need to exceed the
 
06:49:07.510 --> 06:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
budget cap arises it can be approved
 
06:49:10.150 --> 06:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
with super majority support
 
06:49:11.670 --> 06:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
this is just like we do with
 
06:49:13.910 --> 06:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar bonds that's a
 
06:49:15.990 --> 06:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
significant financial commitment
 
06:49:17.910 --> 06:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
requiring a three-fifth super majority
 
06:49:20.390 --> 06:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
approval exceeding the budget cap
 
06:49:23.510 --> 06:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
needs the same level of approval
 
06:49:26.230 --> 06:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
as enabling legislation voters of each
 
06:49:28.468 --> 06:49:28.478 align:start position:0%
school district can propose or adopt the
 
06:49:29.990 --> 06:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
school district budget cap it's not
 
06:49:32.310 --> 06:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
forced on anyone it's not a mandate
 
06:49:33.590 --> 06:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
school districts can decide for
 
06:49:35.350 --> 06:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
themselves if it's if it's appropriate
 
06:49:36.708 --> 06:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
for them
 
06:49:38.788 --> 06:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
school appropriation trajectories are
 
06:49:40.468 --> 06:49:40.478 align:start position:0%
unsustainable from the data i've shown
 
06:49:40.478 --> 06:49:41.830 align:start position:0%
unsustainable from the data i've shown
you

06:49:41.830 --> 06:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:49:43.430 --> 06:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
many including
 
06:49:45.110 --> 06:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
those in the sdga recognize that
 
06:49:47.110 --> 06:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers do not have the unlimited
 
06:49:50.390 --> 06:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
unlimited ability to pay property taxes
 
06:49:52.468 --> 06:49:52.478 align:start position:0%
this provides a mechanism that can be
 
06:49:54.548 --> 06:49:54.558 align:start position:0%
adopted by a supermajority of school
 
06:49:56.788 --> 06:49:56.798 align:start position:0%
district voters to help shape the
 
06:49:59.830 --> 06:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
planning and budgeting process
 
06:50:01.110 --> 06:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your support of new
 
06:50:03.030 --> 06:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens excellence in
 
06:50:04.948 --> 06:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
education and please recommend ought to
 
06:50:06.948 --> 06:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
pass out a committee on this bill thank
 
06:50:09.190 --> 06:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you i have a
 
06:50:11.830 --> 06:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
comment or a question for you
 
06:50:13.990 --> 06:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at cost per student
 
06:50:15.510 --> 06:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
i know you're talking about gross cost
 
06:50:17.110 --> 06:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
per student i want to break that down a
 
06:50:18.868 --> 06:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
06:50:20.468 --> 06:50:20.478 align:start position:0%
so when
 
06:50:22.390 --> 06:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
let's use hollis brookline
 
06:50:23.830 --> 06:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at the cost per
 
06:50:25.190 --> 06:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
student you're looking at all the
 
06:50:27.430 --> 06:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
variable costs are you adding in the
 
06:50:29.430 --> 06:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
fixed costs for the the mortgage for the
 
06:50:32.150 --> 06:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
building and and so forth uh where's
 
06:50:34.788 --> 06:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
where do those costs reside
 
06:50:36.468 --> 06:50:36.478 align:start position:0%
well the gross cost per student it's on
 
06:50:38.310 --> 06:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
the slide this slide here with the bar
 
06:50:40.230 --> 06:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
graph kind of by itself
 
06:50:42.390 --> 06:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's the total appropriations for the
 
06:50:44.708 --> 06:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
school district so it's fixed variable
 
06:50:44.718 --> 06:50:46.070 align:start position:0%
school district so it's fixed variable
everything

06:50:46.070 --> 06:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
everything
 
06:50:47.830 --> 06:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
divided by
 
06:50:49.910 --> 06:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
the number of students that you have
 
06:50:52.230 --> 06:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you that answers it thank you
 
06:50:52.240 --> 06:50:55.110 align:start position:0%
thank you that answers it thank you
yes

06:50:55.110 --> 06:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:57.350 --> 06:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair that was actually
 
06:50:59.990 --> 06:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
kind of part of my question to
 
06:51:02.310 --> 06:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
um i understand how you calculated the
 
06:51:04.868 --> 06:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
cost per student but when you're saying
 
06:51:07.030 --> 06:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
that enrollment goes down
 
06:51:08.948 --> 06:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
um the
 
06:51:10.868 --> 06:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
the cost per student automatically is
 
06:51:12.310 --> 06:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
going to kind of rise a little bit
 
06:51:14.628 --> 06:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
because of those fixed costs is is is
 
06:51:17.350 --> 06:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
that part of this calculation i i don't
 
06:51:19.190 --> 06:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
doubt any of your numbers this looks
 
06:51:21.190 --> 06:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
great and i appreciate that but
 
06:51:23.190 --> 06:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
my question to you is
 
06:51:25.430 --> 06:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
fixed costs will remain the same
 
06:51:28.468 --> 06:51:28.478 align:start position:0%
you know building costs fuel costs etc
 
06:51:30.390 --> 06:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
and if you have less students you spread
 
06:51:32.390 --> 06:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
that out amongst those less students
 
06:51:34.070 --> 06:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
that cost per is going to go up
 
06:51:34.080 --> 06:51:35.350 align:start position:0%
that cost per is going to go up
automatically

06:51:35.350 --> 06:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
06:51:36.948 --> 06:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
i i know you're looking at the variable
 
06:51:39.270 --> 06:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
cost but do you have a way of figuring
 
06:51:42.548 --> 06:51:42.558 align:start position:0%
that in because cpi does not always
 
06:51:44.310 --> 06:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
affect um
 
06:51:46.708 --> 06:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
energy costs and things like that so
 
06:51:48.708 --> 06:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
that's just my question to you
 
06:51:50.548 --> 06:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
well depending on whatever index you
 
06:51:50.558 --> 06:51:51.910 align:start position:0%
well depending on whatever index you
pick

06:51:51.910 --> 06:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
pick
 
06:51:54.708 --> 06:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
employment costs index cpiu they will
 
06:51:57.110 --> 06:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
they all take into account energy i hear
 
06:52:00.468 --> 06:52:00.478 align:start position:0%
your point about fixed costs yes fixed
 
06:52:01.590 --> 06:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
costs will
 
06:52:03.430 --> 06:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
go up and that's part of what the
 
06:52:04.868 --> 06:52:04.878 align:start position:0%
legislative body has to take into
 
06:52:06.548 --> 06:52:06.558 align:start position:0%
account when they set the per cost
 
06:52:08.390 --> 06:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
student that they want to set for this
 
06:52:10.628 --> 06:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
adopting this warrant article
 
06:52:12.788 --> 06:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
i think a wise legislative body would
 
06:52:14.468 --> 06:52:14.478 align:start position:0%
probably pick something that's a little
 
06:52:17.830 --> 06:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
higher just to take that into account
 
06:52:20.150 --> 06:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
and they would you know they would do
 
06:52:20.160 --> 06:52:21.110 align:start position:0%
and they would you know they would do
that

06:52:21.110 --> 06:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:52:24.150 --> 06:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
if there was a dramatic drop in students
 
06:52:25.350 --> 06:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
there's gonna have to be some tough
 
06:52:27.190 --> 06:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
choices made and right now the tough
 
06:52:28.868 --> 06:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
choices in generally aren't being made
 
06:52:30.390 --> 06:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
the staffing does not go down
 
06:52:30.400 --> 06:52:31.830 align:start position:0%
the staffing does not go down
proportionally

06:52:31.830 --> 06:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
proportionally
 
06:52:32.948 --> 06:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
and that's where you would have to make
 
06:52:34.948 --> 06:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
some of the choices there so
 
06:52:36.788 --> 06:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
the whole idea of a budget cap is not
 
06:52:38.708 --> 06:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
just to rubber stamp what's being asked
 
06:52:41.830 --> 06:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
for by the administration
 
06:52:44.070 --> 06:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
or even the school board it's for to
 
06:52:46.150 --> 06:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
force tough choices to be made in times
 
06:52:47.830 --> 06:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
when there's to keep budgets from
 
06:52:51.270 --> 06:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
getting out of control as they have been
 
06:52:51.280 --> 06:52:53.430 align:start position:0%
getting out of control as they have been
represented

06:52:53.430 --> 06:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
represented
 
06:52:55.510 --> 06:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:52:57.110 --> 06:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh my question
 
06:53:00.468 --> 06:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
it's my question is also based on
 
06:53:00.478 --> 06:53:01.430 align:start position:0%
it's my question is also based on
similar

06:53:01.430 --> 06:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
similar
 
06:53:01.440 --> 06:53:02.548 align:start position:0%
similar
um

06:53:02.548 --> 06:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:04.390 --> 06:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
how would the fixed costs and school
 
06:53:07.430 --> 06:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructures and personnel
 
06:53:11.670 --> 06:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
can be so agile as you are predicting
 
06:53:13.750 --> 06:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know proposed or
 
06:53:13.760 --> 06:53:14.948 align:start position:0%
you know proposed or
actual

06:53:14.948 --> 06:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
actual
 
06:53:18.948 --> 06:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
and it's always lagging behind i did
 
06:53:22.150 --> 06:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
serve on the school board in our uh
 
06:53:23.910 --> 06:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
city and
 
06:53:25.910 --> 06:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
and we were building two high schools so
 
06:53:28.948 --> 06:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
that you know understand that
 
06:53:33.270 --> 06:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
agility is lagging behind and this
 
06:53:35.670 --> 06:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
won't this limit
 
06:53:38.150 --> 06:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
the local governing body
 
06:53:40.390 --> 06:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
to do the best for
 
06:53:45.190 --> 06:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
the education of the current population
 
06:53:46.708 --> 06:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
because the drop
 
06:53:49.190 --> 06:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
by the time the population school
 
06:53:51.910 --> 06:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
population drops and you catch up with
 
06:53:53.990 --> 06:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
06:53:56.628 --> 06:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
you know the ebb and flow of that
 
06:53:58.948 --> 06:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
you can't time it just like the stock
 
06:53:58.958 --> 06:53:59.910 align:start position:0%
you can't time it just like the stock
market

06:53:59.910 --> 06:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
market
 
06:54:03.030 --> 06:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
so how would you account for that
 
06:54:04.628 --> 06:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
well it's a choice of the legislative
 
06:54:06.070 --> 06:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
body and with how they choose their
 
06:54:08.468 --> 06:54:08.478 align:start position:0%
number and if you look at any school
 
06:54:10.390 --> 06:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
district budget
 
06:54:11.990 --> 06:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
the lion's share of the budget and i
 
06:54:13.510 --> 06:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
would say some place in the neighborhood
 
06:54:16.150 --> 06:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
of 70 to 80 percent
 
06:54:19.430 --> 06:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
is based on variable cost and there was
 
06:54:21.990 --> 06:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
probably something in the order of 20
 
06:54:23.190 --> 06:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
at best
 
06:54:24.788 --> 06:54:24.798 align:start position:0%
for fixed costs
 
06:54:27.350 --> 06:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
so yes the fixed costs are going to
 
06:54:29.270 --> 06:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
still be there but there are there are a
 
06:54:31.510 --> 06:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
minority of what's in there so i think
 
06:54:33.590 --> 06:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
choosing the number that you use for per
 
06:54:36.548 --> 06:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
student co gross per student cost
 
06:54:39.030 --> 06:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
is a key to getting the super majority
 
06:54:40.948 --> 06:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
support of the legislative body to take
 
06:54:42.628 --> 06:54:42.638 align:start position:0%
that into account
 
06:54:45.270 --> 06:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's not the the goal of the bill to
 
06:54:48.150 --> 06:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
tell people how to make their priorities
 
06:54:50.708 --> 06:54:50.718 align:start position:0%
among different types of spending but it
 
06:54:53.270 --> 06:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
gives them a tool in order to
 
06:54:55.990 --> 06:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
propose this legislation and adopt this
 
06:55:00.310 --> 06:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:03.270 --> 06:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh follow-up
 
06:55:07.110 --> 06:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
you know spending spending cap i get it
 
06:55:10.468 --> 06:55:10.478 align:start position:0%
but education of the future generation
 
06:55:13.990 --> 06:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
is also an investment unless we invest
 
06:55:17.270 --> 06:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
today we don't reap the benefit tomorrow
 
06:55:21.590 --> 06:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
so that investment when you look at the
 
06:55:24.708 --> 06:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
school funding as investment how would
 
06:55:29.270 --> 06:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:30.628 --> 06:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
the school district budget cap is
 
06:55:32.708 --> 06:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
decided by the legislative body of a
 
06:55:34.150 --> 06:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
school district they have to decide for
 
06:55:36.230 --> 06:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
their school where how much they want to
 
06:55:39.350 --> 06:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
invest in at what level they can sustain
 
06:55:41.670 --> 06:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned taxpayers don't have the
 
06:55:43.510 --> 06:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
unlimited ability to pace and there's
 
06:55:45.830 --> 06:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
some limit to what they can pay i do
 
06:55:48.468 --> 06:55:48.478 align:start position:0%
agree that the education is the future
 
06:55:50.150 --> 06:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's why i served on the school board
 
06:55:51.830 --> 06:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's important to me but it's also
 
06:55:53.270 --> 06:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
important to be able to do that in a
 
06:55:55.910 --> 06:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible way and i think
 
06:55:58.708 --> 06:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
that that can be done the spending cap
 
06:56:00.868 --> 06:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
provides that mechanism to help make
 
06:56:03.190 --> 06:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
that bakes it into the budgeting process
 
06:56:04.868 --> 06:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
so that you're making more intelligent
 
06:56:07.510 --> 06:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
decisions earlier on so that you adhere
 
06:56:09.990 --> 06:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
to the budget cap and if the case is
 
06:56:11.190 --> 06:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
that you really need to make those
 
06:56:13.030 --> 06:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
investments and you can get a super
 
06:56:16.468 --> 06:56:16.478 align:start position:0%
majority of the voters to buy into that
 
06:56:19.110 --> 06:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
this this bill lets you do that
 
06:56:21.510 --> 06:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
and so i think it's flexible in that way
 
06:56:22.708 --> 06:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
it helps put
 
06:56:24.628 --> 06:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
it helps put some limits though on
 
06:56:26.868 --> 06:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
spending that the legislative body
 
06:56:29.110 --> 06:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
believes is right for that community in
 
06:56:31.030 --> 06:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
that school district thank you
 
06:56:32.788 --> 06:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
06:56:34.468 --> 06:56:34.478 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
06:56:36.628 --> 06:56:36.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question and i'll try and lean
 
06:56:38.628 --> 06:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
over this way
 
06:56:38.638 --> 06:56:39.590 align:start position:0%
over this way
uh

06:56:39.590 --> 06:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:56:42.070 --> 06:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna assume that uh fixed costs are
 
06:56:43.670 --> 06:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh set and
 
06:56:45.350 --> 06:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
you the school board really doesn't have
 
06:56:46.628 --> 06:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
06:56:48.788 --> 06:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
control over them because it's something
 
06:56:50.548 --> 06:56:50.558 align:start position:0%
that happened in the past
 
06:56:50.558 --> 06:56:51.430 align:start position:0%
that happened in the past
but

06:56:51.430 --> 06:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:56:53.190 --> 06:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
i'm interested in variable costs could
 
06:56:55.270 --> 06:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
you give me some examples of what
 
06:56:58.868 --> 06:56:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:01.750 --> 06:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
variable costs will be associated with
 
06:57:04.310 --> 06:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
um you know all the people cost so how
 
06:57:05.830 --> 06:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
much does how much do you pay your
 
06:57:08.708 --> 06:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
teachers your administrators your sau
 
06:57:08.718 --> 06:57:09.990 align:start position:0%
teachers your administrators your sau
office

06:57:09.990 --> 06:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
office
 
06:57:11.430 --> 06:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
um how many students do you have in
 
06:57:13.030 --> 06:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
special education what are their
 
06:57:13.040 --> 06:57:14.468 align:start position:0%
special education what are their
services

06:57:14.468 --> 06:57:14.478 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:57:14.478 --> 06:57:15.510 align:start position:0%
services
um

06:57:15.510 --> 06:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:57:16.628 --> 06:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:57:19.030 --> 06:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
inflation is some of those costs it's
 
06:57:20.868 --> 06:57:20.878 align:start position:0%
it's a it's it's what's in the most part
 
06:57:22.468 --> 06:57:22.478 align:start position:0%
of the budget is the people cost the
 
06:57:24.948 --> 06:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
amount that's spent on buildings
 
06:57:26.708 --> 06:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
heating and those sorts of things tends
 
06:57:29.830 --> 06:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
to be lower and the inflation index will
 
06:57:31.350 --> 06:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
take care of some of those to some
 
06:57:31.360 --> 06:57:32.310 align:start position:0%
take care of some of those to some
extent

06:57:32.310 --> 06:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
extent
 
06:57:35.670 --> 06:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
but that's why i mentioned 75 80 percent
 
06:57:38.230 --> 06:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
of of school district budgets are
 
06:57:40.150 --> 06:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
variable because they function as a
 
06:57:42.628 --> 06:57:42.638 align:start position:0%
function of the number of students which
 
06:57:44.390 --> 06:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
should be a function of the number you
 
06:57:45.750 --> 06:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
know that should that should affect how
 
06:57:47.510 --> 06:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
many teachers
 
06:57:47.520 --> 06:57:49.270 align:start position:0%
many teachers
administrators

06:57:49.270 --> 06:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
06:57:51.590 --> 06:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
paras support staff
 
06:57:54.070 --> 06:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
and sau office that you have and that
 
06:57:55.270 --> 06:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
those decisions have to be made
 
06:57:56.788 --> 06:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
appropriately you can't keep the same
 
06:57:59.510 --> 06:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
number of teachers when your your school
 
06:58:03.670 --> 06:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:07.990 --> 06:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:11.430 --> 06:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that uh
 
06:58:13.590 --> 06:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
as you said drives the uh
 
06:58:15.510 --> 06:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
the variable cost is the
 
06:58:15.520 --> 06:58:16.468 align:start position:0%
the variable cost is the
the

06:58:16.468 --> 06:58:16.478 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:58:17.910 --> 06:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
personnel cost
 
06:58:18.868 --> 06:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
are the
 
06:58:21.350 --> 06:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
personnel costs in your estimate
 
06:58:23.670 --> 06:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
estimation uh going down with the
 
06:58:24.948 --> 06:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
decrease in
 
06:58:24.958 --> 06:58:27.430 align:start position:0%
decrease in
students

06:58:27.430 --> 06:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:29.750 --> 06:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
the personnel costs are the main reason
 
06:58:32.310 --> 06:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
why the school budgets have gone up and
 
06:58:33.590 --> 06:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
up because
 
06:58:33.600 --> 06:58:34.548 align:start position:0%
up because
the

06:58:34.548 --> 06:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:58:37.030 --> 06:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
the class sizes have gone down
 
06:58:39.590 --> 06:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
and there hasn't been a scaling of the
 
06:58:40.948 --> 06:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
number of teachers the number of
 
06:58:40.958 --> 06:58:43.110 align:start position:0%
number of teachers the number of
administrators

06:58:43.110 --> 06:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
06:58:44.468 --> 06:58:44.478 align:start position:0%
appropriately and a lot of school
 
06:58:45.830 --> 06:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
districts across the new hampshire if
 
06:58:48.868 --> 06:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
you look at why in that budcom study
 
06:58:49.990 --> 06:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
when we were looking at what was
 
06:58:52.548 --> 06:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
happening with school budgets
 
06:58:55.030 --> 06:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know 78 of them had
 
06:58:56.868 --> 06:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
costs that were exceeding inflation and
 
06:58:58.708 --> 06:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
these are recent numbers
 
06:59:00.868 --> 06:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
and so those are all being driven by
 
06:59:02.628 --> 06:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
personnel costs they're not being driven
 
06:59:02.638 --> 06:59:03.430 align:start position:0%
personnel costs they're not being driven
by

06:59:03.430 --> 06:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
by
 
06:59:10.230 --> 06:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:15.590 --> 06:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:17.910 --> 06:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
having served on the school board
 
06:59:20.628 --> 06:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
locally where i live in litchfield
 
06:59:24.150 --> 06:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
i realize that all students are not the
 
06:59:24.160 --> 06:59:25.510 align:start position:0%
i realize that all students are not the
same

06:59:25.510 --> 06:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
same
 
06:59:25.520 --> 06:59:26.548 align:start position:0%
same
and

06:59:26.548 --> 06:59:26.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:59:30.150 --> 06:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
a budget can get blown out of the water
 
06:59:31.990 --> 06:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
with a
 
06:59:34.788 --> 06:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
multiple handicapped person
 
06:59:38.150 --> 06:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
and and the cost for one
 
06:59:40.868 --> 06:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
child moving into the
 
06:59:44.070 --> 06:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
school district and requiring
 
06:59:48.948 --> 06:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
buku services can can really hurt
 
06:59:51.510 --> 06:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
immensely above and beyond what the per
 
06:59:54.788 --> 06:59:54.798 align:start position:0%
pupil cost is i'm wondering how
 
06:59:54.798 --> 06:59:56.150 align:start position:0%
pupil cost is i'm wondering how
this

06:59:56.150 --> 06:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:59:56.160 --> 06:59:57.190 align:start position:0%
this
plan

06:59:57.190 --> 06:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
plan
 
07:00:01.430 --> 07:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:02.948 --> 07:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
right so
 
07:00:04.868 --> 07:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
my background is that i'm an engineer
 
07:00:07.510 --> 07:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
and i i i'm going to talk a little about
 
07:00:09.270 --> 07:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
statistics and such but there's the
 
07:00:10.948 --> 07:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
thing there's a concept called the law
 
07:00:12.468 --> 07:00:12.478 align:start position:0%
of large numbers
 
07:00:14.070 --> 07:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of large numbers says you tend to
 
07:00:15.990 --> 07:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
reach an average the more that you have
 
07:00:17.190 --> 07:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
of something
 
07:00:19.510 --> 07:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
so when you have a large group of
 
07:00:19.520 --> 07:00:20.788 align:start position:0%
so when you have a large group of
students

07:00:20.788 --> 07:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
students
 
07:00:22.548 --> 07:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
you are going to have
 
07:00:24.788 --> 07:00:24.798 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a an average that's
 
07:00:26.708 --> 07:00:26.718 align:start position:0%
going to be spread out over a larger
 
07:00:28.868 --> 07:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
group and larger group you are going to
 
07:00:31.270 --> 07:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
have the occasional outlier
 
07:00:33.030 --> 07:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
there with the special education
 
07:00:33.040 --> 07:00:34.070 align:start position:0%
there with the special education
students

07:00:34.070 --> 07:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
students
 
07:00:35.910 --> 07:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
and you will have to deal with that and
 
07:00:38.390 --> 07:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
that would be a case in which the school
 
07:00:41.190 --> 07:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
board would have to go to the community
 
07:00:44.150 --> 07:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
to the school district and ask for a
 
07:00:46.788 --> 07:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
super majority override to get the funds
 
07:00:48.230 --> 07:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
to take care of that student if they
 
07:00:50.070 --> 07:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
were that astronomical
 
07:00:51.750 --> 07:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
so that that that's that would be the
 
07:00:53.670 --> 07:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
mechanism there but i i believe if you
 
07:00:55.910 --> 07:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
have a school district of any
 
07:00:57.990 --> 07:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
large size there's always going to be a
 
07:01:00.070 --> 07:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
few students that are present so they're
 
07:01:01.830 --> 07:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
always going to be there
 
07:01:03.110 --> 07:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be taken into
 
07:01:04.868 --> 07:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
account when you set your
 
07:01:06.708 --> 07:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
gross cost per student when you pass the
 
07:01:08.788 --> 07:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
warrant article so that's how i would do
 
07:01:10.230 --> 07:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
it and if you had the special case come
 
07:01:11.590 --> 07:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
along that would have to be something
 
07:01:12.708 --> 07:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
that you would have to bring to the
 
07:01:14.948 --> 07:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
legislative body and show that that's
 
07:01:17.030 --> 07:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
needed and i'm sure if that was the case
 
07:01:18.948 --> 07:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
i believe that a super majority would
 
07:01:20.788 --> 07:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
support that to support the students in
 
07:01:25.110 --> 07:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:26.230 --> 07:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
07:01:28.310 --> 07:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is about
 
07:01:31.110 --> 07:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
roman 4 parent a
 
07:01:33.990 --> 07:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
and why you only consider the first
 
07:01:36.948 --> 07:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
year's payment of a bond with the
 
07:01:38.708 --> 07:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
article and the example i will give you
 
07:01:40.708 --> 07:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
is the town of northampton has a bond
 
07:01:42.230 --> 07:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
where year two
 
07:01:43.670 --> 07:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
and thereafter
 
07:01:47.830 --> 07:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
is double what year one is and therefore
 
07:01:49.830 --> 07:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
year one of the bond is the only one i'm
 
07:01:52.390 --> 07:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
asking is is only year one of the bond
 
07:01:54.548 --> 07:01:54.558 align:start position:0%
counting towards the cap
 
07:01:56.310 --> 07:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
and does that create a problem for the
 
07:01:58.548 --> 07:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
school district if the warrant article
 
07:02:00.390 --> 07:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
is approved
 
07:02:03.030 --> 07:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
so if this if the school district adopts
 
07:02:05.670 --> 07:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
this enabling legislation they're going
 
07:02:07.430 --> 07:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
to need to plan
 
07:02:08.948 --> 07:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
for that they can't just look at that
 
07:02:11.190 --> 07:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
year's cost sure they'll get a break on
 
07:02:12.948 --> 07:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
the interest-only payments on the bond
 
07:02:14.150 --> 07:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
the first year
 
07:02:15.270 --> 07:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
and this is a
 
07:02:16.708 --> 07:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
thing i complain about at every school
 
07:02:18.310 --> 07:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
district meeting where they say the tax
 
07:02:20.230 --> 07:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
impact is going to be a nickel
 
07:02:21.510 --> 07:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
per thousand
 
07:02:22.868 --> 07:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
but they're telling about the first year
 
07:02:24.310 --> 07:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
because the next year it might be 15
 
07:02:25.670 --> 07:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
cents per thousand because it has
 
07:02:28.708 --> 07:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
interest in principle not just interest
 
07:02:28.718 --> 07:02:29.590 align:start position:0%
interest in principle not just interest
so

07:02:29.590 --> 07:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:02:31.830 --> 07:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
you would they have to the school board
 
07:02:33.430 --> 07:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
and the budget committee if there is one
 
07:02:35.350 --> 07:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
would have to plan for that
 
07:02:36.868 --> 07:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
not in the year that it happened
 
07:02:38.628 --> 07:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily but would have to know that
 
07:02:40.548 --> 07:02:40.558 align:start position:0%
they have to have that head room in
 
07:02:42.468 --> 07:02:42.478 align:start position:0%
their budget when they're putting forth
 
07:02:42.478 --> 07:02:43.830 align:start position:0%
their budget when they're putting forth
a

07:02:43.830 --> 07:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:02:46.788 --> 07:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
a bond they have to know that they might
 
07:02:48.230 --> 07:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
get by the first year but they have to
 
07:02:50.230 --> 07:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
look ahead a year to see what it's going
 
07:02:52.230 --> 07:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
to do to their budget in the following
 
07:02:54.948 --> 07:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
years so it puts a little more
 
07:02:57.110 --> 07:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
makes them think about the budget in
 
07:02:59.510 --> 07:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
more of a long-term perspective which i
 
07:03:01.830 --> 07:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
think is too much lacking
 
07:03:04.390 --> 07:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
today to think about how a bond would
 
07:03:06.310 --> 07:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
impact them because like it or not the
 
07:03:08.310 --> 07:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are still going to pay it
 
07:03:10.150 --> 07:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's they get a break the first year but
 
07:03:11.910 --> 07:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
the second year is when it in in
 
07:03:20.628 --> 07:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:22.070 --> 07:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
07:03:24.548 --> 07:03:24.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you made a comment
 
07:03:25.830 --> 07:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
that um
 
07:03:27.990 --> 07:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
one of the needs for this bill is that
 
07:03:29.510 --> 07:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
staffing is not going down
 
07:03:32.230 --> 07:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
proportionally to a decrease in student
 
07:03:32.240 --> 07:03:33.670 align:start position:0%
proportionally to a decrease in student
enrollment

07:03:33.670 --> 07:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
07:03:33.680 --> 07:03:35.190 align:start position:0%
enrollment
but

07:03:35.190 --> 07:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:03:38.230 --> 07:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
um is that presuming that
 
07:03:40.310 --> 07:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
students leave like if let's say a
 
07:03:42.310 --> 07:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
hundred students are leaving a district
 
07:03:44.070 --> 07:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
that they're all coming from let's say
 
07:03:46.468 --> 07:03:46.478 align:start position:0%
four classrooms so you can lay off four
 
07:03:46.478 --> 07:03:47.830 align:start position:0%
four classrooms so you can lay off four
teachers

07:03:47.830 --> 07:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
07:03:48.868 --> 07:03:48.878 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
07:03:52.150 --> 07:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
you can have in my district
 
07:03:54.468 --> 07:03:54.478 align:start position:0%
we've seen you know several hundred
 
07:03:56.628 --> 07:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
students leave but it's random
 
07:03:58.548 --> 07:03:58.558 align:start position:0%
throughout the district they're not it
 
07:04:01.750 --> 07:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it might decrease class size by
 
07:04:04.628 --> 07:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
maybe two but it's certainly not enough
 
07:04:07.750 --> 07:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
to lay off a teacher so i was wondering
 
07:04:10.310 --> 07:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
how that proportionality
 
07:04:13.590 --> 07:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
that logic works in this bill
 
07:04:15.030 --> 07:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
well the bill
 
07:04:16.708 --> 07:04:16.718 align:start position:0%
you know you would have to look at
 
07:04:18.548 --> 07:04:18.558 align:start position:0%
what's happening across each grade and
 
07:04:20.708 --> 07:04:20.718 align:start position:0%
so i agree when you have a small number
 
07:04:23.590 --> 07:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
of students per grade disappear that's
 
07:04:24.948 --> 07:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
not going to be a big effect but when
 
07:04:26.548 --> 07:04:26.558 align:start position:0%
you start having
 
07:04:30.230 --> 07:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know 12 13 15 of students there is
 
07:04:31.830 --> 07:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
going to be a point at which you don't
 
07:04:33.430 --> 07:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
need a teacher you don't need two
 
07:04:33.440 --> 07:04:34.468 align:start position:0%
need a teacher you don't need two
teachers

07:04:34.468 --> 07:04:34.478 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
07:04:36.628 --> 07:04:36.638 align:start position:0%
so it's not going to be i call an
 
07:04:38.948 --> 07:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
engineering quantitization so you you
 
07:04:41.030 --> 07:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
know you don't quantize to lose a
 
07:04:42.468 --> 07:04:42.478 align:start position:0%
teacher until you've lost a certain
 
07:04:44.468 --> 07:04:44.478 align:start position:0%
minimum number of students
 
07:04:45.990 --> 07:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
so you would have to take that into
 
07:04:47.990 --> 07:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
account when you're looking at
 
07:04:49.510 --> 07:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
the the
 
07:04:52.390 --> 07:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
staffing levels you know in a school of
 
07:04:55.190 --> 07:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
a significant size so you would once
 
07:04:57.350 --> 07:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
once the students drop below a certain
 
07:04:59.190 --> 07:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
level you're going to have to reduce
 
07:04:59.200 --> 07:05:00.390 align:start position:0%
level you're going to have to reduce
cost

07:05:00.390 --> 07:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
cost
 
07:05:00.400 --> 07:05:02.150 align:start position:0%
cost
so

07:05:02.150 --> 07:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:05:04.468 --> 07:05:04.478 align:start position:0%
you know in our school district we keep
 
07:05:07.270 --> 07:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
adding principals and administrators our
 
07:05:09.030 --> 07:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
sau has doubled
 
07:05:10.628 --> 07:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
that isn't going in the right direction
 
07:05:12.548 --> 07:05:12.558 align:start position:0%
with a declining population so it's not
 
07:05:13.910 --> 07:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
just teachers but it's also
 
07:05:15.510 --> 07:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
administrators why do we need more
 
07:05:17.990 --> 07:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
administrators with less students
 
07:05:19.750 --> 07:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
so that these are all things that are
 
07:05:21.590 --> 07:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
personnel costs that have to be worked
 
07:05:21.600 --> 07:05:22.468 align:start position:0%
personnel costs that have to be worked
out

07:05:22.468 --> 07:05:22.478 align:start position:0%
out
 
07:05:24.788 --> 07:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
um but at some point when you lose
 
07:05:26.230 --> 07:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
enough students you're going to have to
 
07:05:30.310 --> 07:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:32.948 --> 07:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
no i agree that's why election of school
 
07:05:35.350 --> 07:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
board members is important because they
 
07:05:37.590 --> 07:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
will drive the budget but when we
 
07:05:41.110 --> 07:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
getting getting to those the staffing
 
07:05:43.190 --> 07:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
isn't a lot of that cost driven by the
 
07:05:45.510 --> 07:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
labor market
 
07:05:47.430 --> 07:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
especially um
 
07:05:50.628 --> 07:05:50.638 align:start position:0%
you know if let's say a budget cap holds
 
07:05:55.110 --> 07:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
a average salary let's say at 35 000
 
07:05:55.120 --> 07:05:56.070 align:start position:0%
a average salary let's say at 35 000
um

07:05:56.070 --> 07:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:58.548 --> 07:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
but neighboring districts are paying 40
 
07:05:58.558 --> 07:05:59.830 align:start position:0%
but neighboring districts are paying 40
000

07:05:59.830 --> 07:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
000
 
07:06:01.430 --> 07:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
but the budget cup doesn't allow an
 
07:06:05.110 --> 07:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
increase in salary to be competitive
 
07:06:06.390 --> 07:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying i think a lot of the
 
07:06:08.468 --> 07:06:08.478 align:start position:0%
labor costs aren't they driven by the
 
07:06:10.548 --> 07:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
labor market and districts need to be
 
07:06:13.990 --> 07:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
able to participate in that labor market
 
07:06:15.110 --> 07:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i understand what the
 
07:06:17.110 --> 07:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
question is there but you know when the
 
07:06:18.708 --> 07:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
school district decides to do a budget
 
07:06:20.708 --> 07:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
cap they they have to know the pluses
 
07:06:23.190 --> 07:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
and minuses of it and
 
07:06:25.670 --> 07:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
you know if there's a budget cap and
 
07:06:27.350 --> 07:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
they're going in to negotiate with a
 
07:06:29.190 --> 07:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
teacher's union or going in to do a
 
07:06:31.350 --> 07:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
support support staff
 
07:06:33.430 --> 07:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement they're
 
07:06:35.110 --> 07:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
going to go in there with the backing of
 
07:06:36.868 --> 07:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
this school district budget cap and
 
07:06:38.150 --> 07:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to say look we can only
 
07:06:40.628 --> 07:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
pay this much because of this budget cap
 
07:06:42.390 --> 07:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're going to have to try to
 
07:06:44.948 --> 07:06:44.958 align:start position:0%
get a super majority approval to get
 
07:06:46.868 --> 07:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
your collective bargaining agreement
 
07:06:48.948 --> 07:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
passed and that's a decision that's
 
07:06:50.230 --> 07:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
going to be part of the union
 
07:06:52.948 --> 07:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
negotiations it's going to cause some
 
07:06:54.868 --> 07:06:54.878 align:start position:0%
challenges and that's you know that's
 
07:06:56.150 --> 07:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
what's you're going to be looking for
 
07:06:58.310 --> 07:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
some fiscal responsibility
 
07:07:00.390 --> 07:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
maybe some teachers will
 
07:07:02.628 --> 07:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
decide that the raises aren't big enough
 
07:07:04.390 --> 07:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
in hollis brookline for example and
 
07:07:05.990 --> 07:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to go work at souhegan or
 
07:07:08.070 --> 07:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
they'll go work in nashua where the pay
 
07:07:09.190 --> 07:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
is better
 
07:07:11.270 --> 07:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's definitely a risk but
 
07:07:12.468 --> 07:07:12.478 align:start position:0%
that's something that the school
 
07:07:12.478 --> 07:07:13.990 align:start position:0%
that's something that the school
district

07:07:13.990 --> 07:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
district
 
07:07:16.788 --> 07:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
voters decide on what they're at the
 
07:07:17.990 --> 07:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
level of which they're willing to
 
07:07:18.000 --> 07:07:19.110 align:start position:0%
level of which they're willing to
support

07:07:19.110 --> 07:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
support
 
07:07:20.708 --> 07:07:20.718 align:start position:0%
and it's like something you decide when
 
07:07:22.548 --> 07:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
you're going out to buy goods and
 
07:07:24.070 --> 07:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
services if
 
07:07:27.110 --> 07:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
if a stake costs
 
07:07:29.430 --> 07:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
five dollars each you might go buy four
 
07:07:31.670 --> 07:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
of them but if a stake is ten dollars
 
07:07:33.670 --> 07:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
each you might not buy
 
07:07:36.150 --> 07:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
that many you might get less
 
07:07:38.310 --> 07:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit of an analogy but you
 
07:07:39.830 --> 07:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
might not be able to afford quite as
 
07:07:41.030 --> 07:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
many teachers and that's where you'll
 
07:07:43.270 --> 07:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
have to look at maybe increasing
 
07:07:46.150 --> 07:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
your your class sizes to make up for it
 
07:07:47.670 --> 07:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
maybe you can keep up with the labor
 
07:07:49.270 --> 07:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
market but you just can't have as many
 
07:07:51.190 --> 07:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
teachers and that might be that's a
 
07:07:52.708 --> 07:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
that's a decision that the school board
 
07:07:53.750 --> 07:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
has to make
 
07:07:55.910 --> 07:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay just one more question mr chair
 
07:07:59.270 --> 07:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
sorry okay thank you um one other note i
 
07:08:01.830 --> 07:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
want to make is in the years uh the
 
07:08:05.590 --> 07:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 11 around 11
 
07:08:05.600 --> 07:08:07.030 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 11 around 11
um

07:08:07.030 --> 07:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:10.070 --> 07:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
and then we saw a big jump after that
 
07:08:12.708 --> 07:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
that was caused when the state reneged
 
07:08:15.190 --> 07:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
on its commitment to contribute to the
 
07:08:17.830 --> 07:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
state retirement plan and so that burden
 
07:08:19.030 --> 07:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
fell on local
 
07:08:21.110 --> 07:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
districts and municipalities to cover
 
07:08:23.590 --> 07:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
that that difference
 
07:08:24.948 --> 07:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
how would this
 
07:08:26.708 --> 07:08:26.718 align:start position:0%
adjust for things like that might might
 
07:08:28.150 --> 07:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
happen in the future where there is a
 
07:08:30.788 --> 07:08:30.798 align:start position:0%
downshifting of costs that is of
 
07:08:33.910 --> 07:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
no we you know it has nothing to do with
 
07:08:35.590 --> 07:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
local school spending it's just now they
 
07:08:37.590 --> 07:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
have to pay for things like the
 
07:08:39.510 --> 07:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
retirement system that was a commitment
 
07:08:41.910 --> 07:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
of somebody else
 
07:08:43.910 --> 07:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
well it kind of gets back to the last
 
07:08:46.070 --> 07:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
answer that you know if there's cost
 
07:08:48.310 --> 07:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
that you can't control and i agree the
 
07:08:50.230 --> 07:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire retirement system seems to
 
07:08:53.270 --> 07:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
be an unsustainable trajectory i don't
 
07:08:55.590 --> 07:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
like it myself
 
07:08:57.030 --> 07:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
but that's what we're inheriting
 
07:08:58.468 --> 07:08:58.478 align:start position:0%
hopefully the legislature will work on
 
07:09:01.430 --> 07:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
fixing it but if if those costs get so
 
07:09:03.110 --> 07:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
high that you're going to have to be
 
07:09:04.548 --> 07:09:04.558 align:start position:0%
forced to make some decisions in
 
07:09:07.110 --> 07:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
reducing staffing you can't afford
 
07:09:08.468 --> 07:09:08.478 align:start position:0%
your school district budget cap and
 
07:09:10.628 --> 07:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
frankly the taxpayers don't have the
 
07:09:12.390 --> 07:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
unlimited ability to pay you're going to
 
07:09:15.510 --> 07:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
have to start having less teachers
 
07:09:17.990 --> 07:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
in order to stay competitive and absorb
 
07:09:20.468 --> 07:09:20.478 align:start position:0%
these so called
 
07:09:23.590 --> 07:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
out of you know costs you can't control
 
07:09:25.350 --> 07:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
so i think that that's that's what this
 
07:09:27.990 --> 07:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
does this forces some tough decisions
 
07:09:30.310 --> 07:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
potentially if the budgets
 
07:09:33.430 --> 07:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
um rise unreasonably
 
07:09:34.468 --> 07:09:34.478 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:09:34.478 --> 07:09:38.468 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

07:09:38.468 --> 07:09:38.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:39.750 --> 07:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
07:09:41.110 --> 07:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
taking another question for me i'm
 
07:09:43.030 --> 07:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
hoping you can finish this sequence for
 
07:09:43.040 --> 07:09:44.230 align:start position:0%
hoping you can finish this sequence for
me

07:09:44.230 --> 07:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
me
 
07:09:47.270 --> 07:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
the the school board proposes a budget
 
07:09:49.110 --> 07:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
under the cap it's assuming this is
 
07:09:52.230 --> 07:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
approved and the budget committee
 
07:09:54.708 --> 07:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
approves the same budget
 
07:09:56.868 --> 07:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
under the cap all good
 
07:09:58.548 --> 07:09:58.558 align:start position:0%
deliberative session
 
07:10:01.350 --> 07:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
in an sb2 town comes in
 
07:10:01.360 --> 07:10:02.708 align:start position:0%
in an sb2 town comes in
raises

07:10:02.708 --> 07:10:02.718 align:start position:0%
raises
 
07:10:02.718 --> 07:10:03.430 align:start position:0%
raises
the

07:10:03.430 --> 07:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:10:03.440 --> 07:10:04.628 align:start position:0%
the
budget

07:10:04.628 --> 07:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
budget
 
07:10:06.788 --> 07:10:06.798 align:start position:0%
over the cap
 
07:10:08.868 --> 07:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
by warren article whatever the whatever
 
07:10:10.948 --> 07:10:10.958 align:start position:0%
the mechanism was it's higher than the
 
07:10:10.958 --> 07:10:12.070 align:start position:0%
the mechanism was it's higher than the
cap

07:10:12.070 --> 07:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
cap
 
07:10:14.150 --> 07:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
as i read roman 3
 
07:10:17.270 --> 07:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
the proposed appropriation is opposed is
 
07:10:18.788 --> 07:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
over the cap
 
07:10:21.430 --> 07:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
but that appropriation also has to go to
 
07:10:23.430 --> 07:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
the ballot because
 
07:10:25.750 --> 07:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
something has to go to the ballot
 
07:10:27.830 --> 07:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
07:10:30.548 --> 07:10:30.558 align:start position:0%
so ask i have a i have experience with
 
07:10:32.468 --> 07:10:32.478 align:start position:0%
both sp2 and traditional because our
 
07:10:35.110 --> 07:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
brookline school district is traditional
 
07:10:37.350 --> 07:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
our sp our brooklyn town is sb2 and
 
07:10:39.510 --> 07:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
their co-op is traditional so what
 
07:10:41.270 --> 07:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
happens at a deliberative session is
 
07:10:42.788 --> 07:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
they're setting up the ballot just as
 
07:10:44.708 --> 07:10:44.718 align:start position:0%
you said representative
 
07:10:47.110 --> 07:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
so when the ballot is tallied they're
 
07:10:48.788 --> 07:10:48.798 align:start position:0%
going to go in order just like you would
 
07:10:50.868 --> 07:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
do at a meeting the ordering of the
 
07:10:52.948 --> 07:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
ballot makes a difference and so once
 
07:10:55.110 --> 07:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
you reach that article that pushes you
 
07:10:57.030 --> 07:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
over the budget cap if there is one
 
07:10:59.590 --> 07:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
whatever article it will it is
 
07:10:59.600 --> 07:11:00.628 align:start position:0%
whatever article it will it is
will

07:11:00.628 --> 07:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
will
 
07:11:03.990 --> 07:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
require a three-fifth super majority of
 
07:11:05.270 --> 07:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
those voting
 
07:11:06.948 --> 07:11:06.958 align:start position:0%
to pass that article
 
07:11:09.190 --> 07:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
and any other articles afterwards that
 
07:11:12.150 --> 07:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
would also uh break the cap
 
07:11:14.708 --> 07:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
in the case of a
 
07:11:17.030 --> 07:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
if the operating budget is the one doing
 
07:11:19.110 --> 07:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
that which i anticipate was another one
 
07:11:20.788 --> 07:11:20.798 align:start position:0%
of your questions
 
07:11:23.430 --> 07:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
you'll have you will you have a proposed
 
07:11:24.788 --> 07:11:24.798 align:start position:0%
budget i'm not sure everybody here
 
07:11:26.310 --> 07:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
understands sp2 you have a proposed
 
07:11:28.468 --> 07:11:28.478 align:start position:0%
budget and a default budget if the
 
07:11:30.708 --> 07:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
proposed budget if you get a majority
 
07:11:31.830 --> 07:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get the proposed
 
07:11:33.270 --> 07:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
budget you're going to get the budget
 
07:11:33.280 --> 07:11:34.468 align:start position:0%
budget you're going to get the budget
that

07:11:34.468 --> 07:11:34.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:11:37.190 --> 07:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
if it's over 50 but less than 60 percent
 
07:11:38.948 --> 07:11:38.958 align:start position:0%
you're going to get the budget that's
 
07:11:40.830 --> 07:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
adjusted to meet the tax
 
07:11:42.788 --> 07:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
cap if it's
 
07:11:45.110 --> 07:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
actual yes and if you get below 50
 
07:11:45.120 --> 07:11:46.390 align:start position:0%
actual yes and if you get below 50
percent

07:11:46.390 --> 07:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
percent
 
07:11:48.230 --> 07:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
you are going to get the default budget
 
07:11:51.110 --> 07:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
if that default budget is also over the
 
07:11:51.120 --> 07:11:51.990 align:start position:0%
if that default budget is also over the
cap

07:11:51.990 --> 07:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
cap
 
07:11:53.990 --> 07:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
that will be truncated to be compliant
 
07:11:55.750 --> 07:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
with the cap
 
07:12:01.030 --> 07:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:02.468 --> 07:12:02.478 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
07:12:04.468 --> 07:12:04.478 align:start position:0%
taking my question i just wondered if
 
07:12:06.230 --> 07:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
you could give me the source of your
 
07:12:07.990 --> 07:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
numbers about the decline in student
 
07:12:11.270 --> 07:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
population from 12 13 15 is that a local
 
07:12:12.628 --> 07:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
number or
 
07:12:15.110 --> 07:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
is it can you can i find it on google
 
07:12:15.120 --> 07:12:16.468 align:start position:0%
is it can you can i find it on google
somewhere

07:12:16.468 --> 07:12:16.478 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
07:12:18.708 --> 07:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
what are you asking for you keep talking
 
07:12:21.670 --> 07:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
about the decline in student enrollment
 
07:12:25.110 --> 07:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
as being 13 15 percent and i just want
 
07:12:26.628 --> 07:12:26.638 align:start position:0%
to cite i want to know where you got
 
07:12:28.628 --> 07:12:28.638 align:start position:0%
that number well you can look at the
 
07:12:30.708 --> 07:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
department of education has
 
07:12:32.788 --> 07:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
statistics on that you can see statewide
 
07:12:34.548 --> 07:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
we've been seeing that
 
07:12:36.070 --> 07:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
i gave you some data for the hollis
 
07:12:37.910 --> 07:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
brookline co-op here you can see the
 
07:12:41.350 --> 07:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
numbers there and
 
07:12:43.750 --> 07:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know i also had some recent numbers
 
07:12:45.990 --> 07:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
from the budcom
 
07:12:48.150 --> 07:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
study committee that was sponsored by
 
07:12:50.150 --> 07:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
the select board of brookline
 
07:12:51.990 --> 07:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
that was not for that length of time
 
07:12:54.628 --> 07:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
though that was a shorter window but the
 
07:12:56.468 --> 07:12:56.478 align:start position:0%
department of education if you look at
 
07:12:58.390 --> 07:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
any school district and i believe you
 
07:12:59.990 --> 07:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
also might have received some testimony
 
07:13:02.948 --> 07:13:02.958 align:start position:0%
from timberlane that also showed another
 
07:13:06.230 --> 07:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
example of a declining enrollment it's
 
07:13:08.070 --> 07:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
the the the what we're experiencing here
 
07:13:09.750 --> 07:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is that there's just is
 
07:13:12.310 --> 07:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
not as many students being born to new
 
07:13:14.310 --> 07:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents for whatever reason
 
07:13:16.548 --> 07:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
and that's translating to a lower
 
07:13:16.558 --> 07:13:17.590 align:start position:0%
and that's translating to a lower
um

07:13:17.590 --> 07:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:13:20.070 --> 07:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
student population and that's what we're
 
07:13:24.948 --> 07:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:25.990 --> 07:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
hey uh
 
07:13:30.948 --> 07:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:33.430 --> 07:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes schools
 
07:13:35.670 --> 07:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
just by
 
07:13:35.680 --> 07:13:36.628 align:start position:0%
just by
by

07:13:36.628 --> 07:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
by
 
07:13:38.708 --> 07:13:38.718 align:start position:0%
bad luck i guess
 
07:13:39.830 --> 07:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
end up
 
07:13:43.270 --> 07:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
with some really profoundly handicapped
 
07:13:43.280 --> 07:13:44.628 align:start position:0%
with some really profoundly handicapped
children

07:13:44.628 --> 07:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
children
 
07:13:46.948 --> 07:13:46.958 align:start position:0%
and they can't say
 
07:13:50.070 --> 07:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
we can't afford you they have to
 
07:13:51.910 --> 07:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
attempt to educate them
 
07:13:54.708 --> 07:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
and in some some of those cases
 
07:13:54.718 --> 07:13:55.830 align:start position:0%
and in some some of those cases
their

07:13:55.830 --> 07:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
07:13:58.070 --> 07:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
students are outplaced
 
07:14:02.150 --> 07:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:02.160 --> 07:14:03.590 align:start position:0%
 
institutions

07:14:03.590 --> 07:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
07:14:05.190 --> 07:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of
 
07:14:08.150 --> 07:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
some that are in excess of 200 000 a
 
07:14:08.160 --> 07:14:09.990 align:start position:0%
some that are in excess of 200 000 a
year

07:14:09.990 --> 07:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
07:14:11.430 --> 07:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
07:14:13.110 --> 07:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
when a school
 
07:14:13.120 --> 07:14:14.948 align:start position:0%
when a school
gets

07:14:14.948 --> 07:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
gets
 
07:14:17.350 --> 07:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
i hit with those types of costs
 
07:14:19.590 --> 07:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
how would this plan
 
07:14:22.230 --> 07:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
make an adjustment for that so that
 
07:14:23.990 --> 07:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
if we're going to spend
 
07:14:26.628 --> 07:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
500 000 on these three students
 
07:14:28.468 --> 07:14:28.478 align:start position:0%
does that mean the rest of the students
 
07:14:29.670 --> 07:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
are going to get
 
07:14:31.430 --> 07:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
get burned by
 
07:14:34.070 --> 07:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
by being averaged in and saying we have
 
07:14:36.070 --> 07:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
to drop your costs down because we're
 
07:14:38.070 --> 07:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the collective costs how do
 
07:14:39.750 --> 07:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
you how do you
 
07:14:41.670 --> 07:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
deal with something like that
 
07:14:43.030 --> 07:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
well it depends on the size of your
 
07:14:44.788 --> 07:14:44.798 align:start position:0%
school district so this is a decision
 
07:14:47.110 --> 07:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
for the local legislative body if you
 
07:14:48.548 --> 07:14:48.558 align:start position:0%
have a large school district you can
 
07:14:50.708 --> 07:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
tend to absorb those costs and spread
 
07:14:53.190 --> 07:14:53.200 align:start position:0%
them out over the larger population in a
 
07:14:55.670 --> 07:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
small school district you may or may not
 
07:14:57.110 --> 07:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
want the school district budget cap it
 
07:14:59.110 --> 07:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
might not make sense for you in light of
 
07:15:01.190 --> 07:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
that potential situation
 
07:15:02.868 --> 07:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
again it's sort of the law of large
 
07:15:04.230 --> 07:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
numbers you
 
07:15:06.310 --> 07:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
if you see these things periodically and
 
07:15:08.070 --> 07:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
i think most large school districts have
 
07:15:10.150 --> 07:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
a few students in this category they're
 
07:15:11.110 --> 07:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
07:15:12.868 --> 07:15:12.878 align:start position:0%
they're going to be kind of baked into
 
07:15:12.878 --> 07:15:13.830 align:start position:0%
they're going to be kind of baked into
the

07:15:13.830 --> 07:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:15:15.990 --> 07:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
number that you're using the gross cost
 
07:15:17.830 --> 07:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
per student
 
07:15:17.840 --> 07:15:18.548 align:start position:0%
per student
and

07:15:18.548 --> 07:15:18.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:15:21.350 --> 07:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
the other case as i mentioned earlier
 
07:15:23.910 --> 07:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
you can go to the legislative body and
 
07:15:26.548 --> 07:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
make your case that we have these
 
07:15:28.548 --> 07:15:28.558 align:start position:0%
extreme costs
 
07:15:30.230 --> 07:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
do you want this to affect all the other
 
07:15:32.868 --> 07:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
students or will you do a super majority
 
07:15:36.230 --> 07:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
override to support this for the four
 
07:15:37.910 --> 07:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
years six years
 
07:15:39.430 --> 07:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
whatever the number of years that
 
07:15:44.150 --> 07:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
student tax cap was agreed to exceeded
 
07:15:45.830 --> 07:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason
 
07:15:47.990 --> 07:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
does that have to be
 
07:15:50.788 --> 07:15:50.798 align:start position:0%
re-energized or re-passed every year or
 
07:15:51.670 --> 07:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
is it
 
07:15:53.590 --> 07:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
become like a default budget that you
 
07:15:54.788 --> 07:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
know you
 
07:15:56.868 --> 07:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
we we had to raise the cap
 
07:15:59.670 --> 07:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
four million dollars for whatever
 
07:16:01.350 --> 07:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
you start the next year four million
 
07:16:03.190 --> 07:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
dollars higher are you are you back down
 
07:16:04.948 --> 07:16:04.958 align:start position:0%
to where you were as like a zero-based
 
07:16:04.958 --> 07:16:06.310 align:start position:0%
to where you were as like a zero-based
budget

07:16:06.310 --> 07:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
budget
 
07:16:08.788 --> 07:16:08.798 align:start position:0%
it's more along a zero-based budget
 
07:16:10.788 --> 07:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
but it does have the inflation factor so
 
07:16:13.910 --> 07:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
if you look at this graph here that
 
07:16:15.990 --> 07:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
the colored graph that had the two lines
 
07:16:17.510 --> 07:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
on it you can see
 
07:16:19.590 --> 07:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
both lines are going up
 
07:16:22.628 --> 07:16:22.638 align:start position:0%
very rapidly because that's using the
 
07:16:25.590 --> 07:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
most recent inflation statistic of cpiu
 
07:16:25.600 --> 07:16:26.468 align:start position:0%
most recent inflation statistic of cpiu
which

07:16:26.468 --> 07:16:26.478 align:start position:0%
which
 
07:16:27.510 --> 07:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
under the
 
07:16:29.750 --> 07:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
last year was seven and a half percent
 
07:16:31.590 --> 07:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
hate to say it but that's where we're at
 
07:16:34.628 --> 07:16:34.638 align:start position:0%
so this takes that into account
 
07:16:37.510 --> 07:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
and so you you use the same gross
 
07:16:39.750 --> 07:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
student per cost but it gets it it's
 
07:16:42.070 --> 07:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
adjusted by either the fixed percentage
 
07:16:45.110 --> 07:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
compounded over time or by the
 
07:16:47.670 --> 07:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh labor statistics metric that you've
 
07:16:47.680 --> 07:16:48.788 align:start position:0%
uh labor statistics metric that you've
chosen

07:16:48.788 --> 07:16:48.798 align:start position:0%
chosen
 
07:16:51.110 --> 07:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
so it makes you so if you had a student
 
07:16:53.670 --> 07:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
you potentially may need to
 
07:16:53.680 --> 07:16:54.628 align:start position:0%
you potentially may need to
uh

07:16:54.628 --> 07:16:54.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:16:56.708 --> 07:16:56.718 align:start position:0%
do an override for a few years until it
 
07:16:58.548 --> 07:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
comes in line with the budget
 
07:17:00.388 --> 07:17:00.398 align:start position:0%
so that yeah that that would be the case
 
07:17:02.150 --> 07:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
in that um
 
07:17:02.160 --> 07:17:03.670 align:start position:0%
in that um
extreme

07:17:03.670 --> 07:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
extreme
 
07:17:10.070 --> 07:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:12.230 --> 07:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you again for
 
07:17:14.230 --> 07:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
i would like to follow up on what the
 
07:17:16.468 --> 07:17:16.478 align:start position:0%
chairman said
 
07:17:20.070 --> 07:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
i think there would be a tendency if a
 
07:17:21.990 --> 07:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
let's say we had a smaller school
 
07:17:22.000 --> 07:17:23.190 align:start position:0%
let's say we had a smaller school
district

07:17:23.190 --> 07:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
district
 
07:17:23.200 --> 07:17:25.110 align:start position:0%
district
and

07:17:25.110 --> 07:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:17:27.590 --> 07:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
a new student moved into town that was
 
07:17:27.600 --> 07:17:29.270 align:start position:0%
a new student moved into town that was
profoundly

07:17:29.270 --> 07:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
profoundly
 
07:17:31.670 --> 07:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
multiply handicapped
 
07:17:33.750 --> 07:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
everyone in town would know that this
 
07:17:35.830 --> 07:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
person moved into town
 
07:17:38.388 --> 07:17:38.398 align:start position:0%
if there was an override
 
07:17:41.910 --> 07:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
to accommodate this one student
 
07:17:43.590 --> 07:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
don't you think that
 
07:17:44.830 --> 07:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
there would be
 
07:17:47.750 --> 07:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
animosity in the town
 
07:17:51.270 --> 07:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
possibly toward the student
 
07:17:51.280 --> 07:17:52.150 align:start position:0%
possibly toward the student
my

07:17:52.150 --> 07:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
my
 
07:17:53.670 --> 07:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
my suggestion
 
07:17:57.190 --> 07:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm not against the the concept of
 
07:17:57.200 --> 07:17:58.150 align:start position:0%
and i'm not against the the concept of
this

07:17:58.150 --> 07:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:18:02.150 --> 07:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
but you you need to somehow accommodate
 
07:18:04.468 --> 07:18:04.478 align:start position:0%
special education
 
07:18:07.670 --> 07:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
into this because if you don't and i i
 
07:18:09.990 --> 07:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
know it's it's not
 
07:18:12.708 --> 07:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
beyond the realm of possibility that one
 
07:18:16.230 --> 07:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
student could be 250 000
 
07:18:18.388 --> 07:18:18.398 align:start position:0%
and i know that to be a fact because
 
07:18:20.788 --> 07:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
they outplace these students
 
07:18:24.868 --> 07:18:24.878 align:start position:0%
and if it takes a a super majority to
 
07:18:26.948 --> 07:18:26.958 align:start position:0%
accommodate that
 
07:18:29.190 --> 07:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of bad
 
07:18:32.948 --> 07:18:32.958 align:start position:0%
feelings in town toward that situation
 
07:18:35.030 --> 07:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
and that's my question i
 
07:18:37.350 --> 07:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
is there any way that you can
 
07:18:39.670 --> 07:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
accommodate that
 
07:18:39.680 --> 07:18:42.388 align:start position:0%
accommodate that
situation

07:18:42.388 --> 07:18:42.398 align:start position:0%
situation
 
07:18:43.750 --> 07:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
i would have to think about that a
 
07:18:45.990 --> 07:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more if that would be
 
07:18:48.070 --> 07:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
something there would make the law more
 
07:18:48.080 --> 07:18:49.670 align:start position:0%
something there would make the law more
complicated

07:18:49.670 --> 07:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
07:18:49.680 --> 07:18:53.030 align:start position:0%
complicated
and

07:18:53.030 --> 07:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:53.990 --> 07:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:18:56.150 --> 07:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
i was on the school board i had seen
 
07:18:57.910 --> 07:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
some of these two hundred thousand
 
07:19:00.230 --> 07:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
dollar plus placements i didn't know who
 
07:19:01.430 --> 07:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
they were
 
07:19:03.270 --> 07:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
but i saw you know this with there was
 
07:19:04.548 --> 07:19:04.558 align:start position:0%
an id number with the student
 
07:19:06.070 --> 07:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
essentially so that's all i knew that
 
07:19:08.628 --> 07:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
they existed so i am from i know they do
 
07:19:11.030 --> 07:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
exist and i'm familiar with that
 
07:19:13.670 --> 07:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
but the in in a school budget that we
 
07:19:15.270 --> 07:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
have of
 
07:19:18.628 --> 07:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
26 million dollars 27 million dollars
 
07:19:20.388 --> 07:19:20.398 align:start position:0%
that's something that you can adjust if
 
07:19:22.628 --> 07:19:22.638 align:start position:0%
you have a small school district
 
07:19:24.868 --> 07:19:24.878 align:start position:0%
maybe this budget cap isn't isn't
 
07:19:26.548 --> 07:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
something that you want to choose is
 
07:19:28.548 --> 07:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation it's not one size
 
07:19:30.150 --> 07:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
fits all it makes sense for some
 
07:19:30.160 --> 07:19:31.350 align:start position:0%
fits all it makes sense for some
communities

07:19:31.350 --> 07:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
communities
 
07:19:33.110 --> 07:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense for others i would
 
07:19:34.868 --> 07:19:34.878 align:start position:0%
argue that the smallest communities
 
07:19:36.708 --> 07:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't want that because of
 
07:19:40.230 --> 07:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
this situation i think in a large
 
07:19:42.230 --> 07:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know school district like the hollis
 
07:19:45.270 --> 07:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
brooklyn co-op i think you would see
 
07:19:46.868 --> 07:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
that that would not
 
07:19:49.350 --> 07:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
overly upset the apple cart in terms of
 
07:19:51.270 --> 07:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
the finances i think it would be
 
07:19:52.468 --> 07:19:52.478 align:start position:0%
absorbed so
 
07:19:54.230 --> 07:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
this is just an option for school
 
07:19:55.990 --> 07:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
districts the school district doesn't
 
07:19:58.150 --> 07:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
have to adopt it and i would probably
 
07:20:00.628 --> 07:20:00.638 align:start position:0%
advise them on against it on a small
 
07:20:02.948 --> 07:20:02.958 align:start position:0%
school district for these reasons
 
07:20:05.190 --> 07:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes
 
07:20:07.350 --> 07:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative majipudi
 
07:20:09.190 --> 07:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
07:20:13.590 --> 07:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
my question um you um keep referring uh
 
07:20:16.468 --> 07:20:16.478 align:start position:0%
to the numbers game right the larger the
 
07:20:17.910 --> 07:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
number better
 
07:20:21.830 --> 07:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
of adjusting and agility in terms of per
 
07:20:24.070 --> 07:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
student spending and
 
07:20:24.080 --> 07:20:25.510 align:start position:0%
student spending and
fluctuations

07:20:25.510 --> 07:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
fluctuations
 
07:20:25.520 --> 07:20:26.708 align:start position:0%
fluctuations
um

07:20:26.708 --> 07:20:26.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:20:29.590 --> 07:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
nashua is the second largest city in the
 
07:20:31.830 --> 07:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
state and when i was on the school board
 
07:20:34.788 --> 07:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
it was thirteen thousand hundred 682
 
07:20:37.750 --> 07:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
students that we were responsible for
 
07:20:37.760 --> 07:20:39.190 align:start position:0%
students that we were responsible for
and

07:20:39.190 --> 07:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:20:42.548 --> 07:20:42.558 align:start position:0%
what would you consider for what was the
 
07:20:44.230 --> 07:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
number first
 
07:20:47.430 --> 07:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
towns that is small or medium or large
 
07:20:50.468 --> 07:20:50.478 align:start position:0%
what is the numbers game that
 
07:20:50.478 --> 07:20:51.270 align:start position:0%
what is the numbers game that
you're

07:20:51.270 --> 07:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
you're
 
07:20:54.628 --> 07:20:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:56.628 --> 07:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of number of students
 
07:20:57.750 --> 07:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
i would say
 
07:21:00.070 --> 07:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
you know ones that are on the ballpark
 
07:21:02.788 --> 07:21:02.798 align:start position:0%
of maybe let 500 students in the school
 
07:21:05.030 --> 07:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
district or less i would say would be on
 
07:21:06.708 --> 07:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
the small side
 
07:21:09.430 --> 07:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know that the the factor of what's
 
07:21:11.190 --> 07:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
being represented by representative
 
07:21:13.430 --> 07:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
cells here
 
07:21:16.070 --> 07:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's where that might come into play
 
07:21:17.750 --> 07:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
but in a large school district where you
 
07:21:17.760 --> 07:21:18.788 align:start position:0%
but in a large school district where you
have

07:21:18.788 --> 07:21:18.798 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:21:20.948 --> 07:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
you know thousands of students you know
 
07:21:24.310 --> 07:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
i know nashua is large manchester
 
07:21:27.110 --> 07:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
um the larger school districts don't
 
07:21:29.510 --> 07:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
would be able to absorb those outliers
 
07:21:30.948 --> 07:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
more than
 
07:21:32.468 --> 07:21:32.478 align:start position:0%
a small school district so i think it's
 
07:21:34.388 --> 07:21:34.398 align:start position:0%
up to the legislative body
 
07:21:35.830 --> 07:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
to determine if it's right for their
 
07:21:37.910 --> 07:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
community giving school districts an
 
07:21:37.920 --> 07:21:39.350 align:start position:0%
community giving school districts an
option

07:21:39.350 --> 07:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
option
 
07:21:41.110 --> 07:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
is is what
 
07:21:43.030 --> 07:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
i think is important here
 
07:21:45.750 --> 07:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i didn't mention but if they adopted
 
07:21:47.990 --> 07:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
this and they saw that it was backfiring
 
07:21:50.948 --> 07:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
they could rescind it as well similarly
 
07:21:52.230 --> 07:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
like you can rescind other things you
 
07:21:53.910 --> 07:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
rescinded by a super majority vote you
 
07:21:55.990 --> 07:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
adopt by a super majority vote so if it
 
07:21:57.190 --> 07:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
didn't work for them they're not stuck
 
07:21:59.430 --> 07:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
in it forever if it really boxes them in
 
07:22:01.590 --> 07:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
and they just don't see a way out
 
07:22:03.990 --> 07:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
they could they could unadopt the
 
07:22:05.350 --> 07:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
budget cap
 
07:22:05.360 --> 07:22:06.788 align:start position:0%
budget cap
okay

07:22:06.788 --> 07:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:22:09.270 --> 07:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
this is a complex issue we could be here
 
07:22:10.310 --> 07:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
all night
 
07:22:12.628 --> 07:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
let me introduce a couple additional
 
07:22:14.628 --> 07:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
speakers that want to contribute here to
 
07:22:17.510 --> 07:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
the discussion thank you mr power for
 
07:22:20.468 --> 07:22:20.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:27.110 --> 07:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:28.548 --> 07:22:28.558 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire school boards
 
07:22:28.558 --> 07:22:35.190 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire school boards
association

07:22:35.190 --> 07:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:38.948 --> 07:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
feel free to use the sanitizer
 
07:22:40.628 --> 07:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chairman dolan thank
 
07:22:42.070 --> 07:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee my name is

director of the new hampshire school
 
07:22:47.628 --> 07:22:47.638 align:start position:0%
boards association um we're opposed to
 
07:22:50.388 --> 07:22:50.398 align:start position:0%
1393. i'm not going to spend a lot of
 
07:22:52.708 --> 07:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
time on the concerns
 
07:22:54.310 --> 07:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
and questions that the school boards
 
07:22:56.468 --> 07:22:56.478 align:start position:0%
association had with uh with the bill i
 
07:22:58.388 --> 07:22:58.398 align:start position:0%
think have been brought up sufficiently
 
07:23:00.230 --> 07:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
um by members of the committee there are
 
07:23:01.670 --> 07:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
a couple things that i
 
07:23:03.590 --> 07:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
would like to just um you know get the
 
07:23:06.230 --> 07:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
committee to to to recognize
 
07:23:07.190 --> 07:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
i haven't been in front of this
 
07:23:08.150 --> 07:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
committee i don't know if i've been in
 
07:23:09.350 --> 07:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
this front of this committee this
 
07:23:12.070 --> 07:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
session um i'm up here from time to time
 
07:23:14.150 --> 07:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding is many of you have
 
07:23:16.070 --> 07:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
experience on local government local
 
07:23:18.310 --> 07:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
school boards or select boards so when
 
07:23:20.388 --> 07:23:20.398 align:start position:0%
you're putting together your budget what
 
07:23:21.830 --> 07:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
are you trying to do you've got
 
07:23:23.670 --> 07:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
competing interests don't you you're
 
07:23:25.510 --> 07:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
trying to provide from a school context
 
07:23:27.270 --> 07:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
you're doing trying to provide the best
 
07:23:29.430 --> 07:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
possible education that you can for what
 
07:23:32.150 --> 07:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers are are able to tolerate
 
07:23:33.830 --> 07:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
and able to bear
 
07:23:35.030 --> 07:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
school board members are not just
 
07:23:36.788 --> 07:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
handing out money and
 
07:23:39.350 --> 07:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
and and putting you know
 
07:23:42.070 --> 07:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
gold you know toilet seats on things and
 
07:23:44.310 --> 07:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
and the latest greatest football fields
 
07:23:44.320 --> 07:23:45.110 align:start position:0%
and the latest greatest football fields
and

07:23:45.110 --> 07:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:23:46.708 --> 07:23:46.718 align:start position:0%
the latest greatest facilities we're
 
07:23:48.548 --> 07:23:48.558 align:start position:0%
trying to manage our obligations to
 
07:23:48.558 --> 07:23:49.590 align:start position:0%
trying to manage our obligations to
educate

07:23:49.590 --> 07:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
educate
 
07:23:49.600 --> 07:23:50.468 align:start position:0%
educate
children

07:23:50.468 --> 07:23:50.478 align:start position:0%
children
 
07:23:53.030 --> 07:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
with what the taxpayers can specifically
 
07:23:53.040 --> 07:23:54.150 align:start position:0%
with what the taxpayers can specifically
pay

07:23:54.150 --> 07:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
pay
 
07:23:56.150 --> 07:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
i would take some issue with some of the
 
07:23:56.160 --> 07:23:57.270 align:start position:0%
i would take some issue with some of the
comments

07:23:57.270 --> 07:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
comments
 
07:23:59.910 --> 07:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
that about fixed costs and and static
 
07:23:59.920 --> 07:24:01.350 align:start position:0%
that about fixed costs and and static
costs

07:24:01.350 --> 07:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
costs
 
07:24:02.948 --> 07:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
for those of you that have been on local
 
07:24:04.548 --> 07:24:04.558 align:start position:0%
government and you're going through your
 
07:24:07.110 --> 07:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
line items during budget season
 
07:24:09.190 --> 07:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
where are your fixed costs if your
 
07:24:10.388 --> 07:24:10.398 align:start position:0%
employees are under a collective
 
07:24:12.230 --> 07:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement you can't change
 
07:24:12.240 --> 07:24:13.270 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement you can't change
that

07:24:13.270 --> 07:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:24:14.628 --> 07:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
still costs the same to heat the
 
07:24:16.468 --> 07:24:16.478 align:start position:0%
building gasoline is a lot more
 
07:24:18.150 --> 07:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
expensive today than we probably
 
07:24:19.670 --> 07:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
budgeted we meaning school districts
 
07:24:21.910 --> 07:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
probably budgeted a year and a half ago
 
07:24:23.030 --> 07:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
when we were putting together our
 
07:24:26.948 --> 07:24:26.958 align:start position:0%
budgets um also the the on page line uh
 
07:24:29.510 --> 07:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
page one line nine of the bill it talks
 
07:24:29.520 --> 07:24:30.388 align:start position:0%
page one line nine of the bill it talks
about

07:24:30.388 --> 07:24:30.398 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:24:33.190 --> 07:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
um uh a plus an amount for an annual
 
07:24:35.350 --> 07:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
increase in inflation i think we're all
 
07:24:37.350 --> 07:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
hoping that inflation may
 
07:24:39.110 --> 07:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
decrease at some point over the next
 
07:24:41.110 --> 07:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
couple of years so we're not spending
 
07:24:42.708 --> 07:24:42.718 align:start position:0%
ten dollars on a steak we can spend
 
07:24:44.948 --> 07:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
seven dollars on a steak um because i
 
07:24:46.868 --> 07:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
like steak too and i'm being priced out
 
07:24:48.310 --> 07:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
of it now and then
 
07:24:51.510 --> 07:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
um you know the other aspects to um that
 
07:24:53.110 --> 07:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
i just sort of wanted to bring up
 
07:24:55.190 --> 07:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
generally um you know
 
07:24:56.310 --> 07:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
about the
 
07:24:59.350 --> 07:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
the the the declining in enrollment
 
07:25:01.030 --> 07:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative gilman i believe it was
 
07:25:02.468 --> 07:25:02.478 align:start position:0%
you that asked about declining
 
07:25:04.150 --> 07:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
enrollment um
 
07:25:05.910 --> 07:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head the numbers are
 
07:25:07.590 --> 07:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
on the department of education website i
 
07:25:10.708 --> 07:25:10.718 align:start position:0%
believe statewide we're down about 30 to
 
07:25:13.990 --> 07:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
35 000 students over the last 20 years
 
07:25:15.910 --> 07:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
enrolled in in public schools in new
 
07:25:18.150 --> 07:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire i think we topped out around
 
07:25:21.190 --> 07:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
the year 2000 we had about 200 000 still
 
07:25:23.190 --> 07:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
students enrolled and representative i
 
07:25:24.548 --> 07:25:24.558 align:start position:0%
see sort of nodding along i believe
 
07:25:27.510 --> 07:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're down to about 165 000 students
 
07:25:29.510 --> 07:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
i will say over the last 20 years the
 
07:25:30.788 --> 07:25:30.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legislature has
 
07:25:33.510 --> 07:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
downshifted cost after cost after cost
 
07:25:36.788 --> 07:25:36.798 align:start position:0%
after cost on on local school districts
 
07:25:38.868 --> 07:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
the retirement costs have been brought
 
07:25:41.510 --> 07:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
up those go up every year we've had some
 
07:25:43.830 --> 07:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
questions about um special education
 
07:25:45.670 --> 07:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
costs the state has underfunded special
 
07:25:48.310 --> 07:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
education ed education aid to the tune
 
07:25:50.310 --> 07:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
of about seven million dollars statewide
 
07:25:52.708 --> 07:25:52.718 align:start position:0%
every year um and just running some of
 
07:25:55.910 --> 07:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
the the quick numbers let's say we had a
 
07:25:57.990 --> 07:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
student a school district of a thousand
 
07:26:00.948 --> 07:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
students and that's k through 12. so 13
 
07:26:03.830 --> 07:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
grade levels that comes out to 76
 
07:26:05.990 --> 07:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
students per grade level
 
07:26:08.548 --> 07:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
if we lost 15 percent of our students
 
07:26:10.788 --> 07:26:10.798 align:start position:0%
over the course of let's say 10 or 15
 
07:26:10.798 --> 07:26:13.430 align:start position:0%
over the course of let's say 10 or 15
years

07:26:13.430 --> 07:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:17.110 --> 07:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
that's 850 students divided by 13 years
 
07:26:20.070 --> 07:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
65 students per class per grade level
 
07:26:21.510 --> 07:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
07:26:23.510 --> 07:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
some of these are also local decisions
 
07:26:25.830 --> 07:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards for public
 
07:26:27.670 --> 07:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
education department of education rule
 
07:26:30.948 --> 07:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
306 state that the maximum number of
 
07:26:32.708 --> 07:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
students you can have in an elementary
 
07:26:35.830 --> 07:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
school classroom is 25.
 
07:26:37.510 --> 07:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
some communities through school board
 
07:26:39.590 --> 07:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
work and through the expectations of
 
07:26:42.788 --> 07:26:42.798 align:start position:0%
parents and and and mothers and fathers
 
07:26:44.708 --> 07:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
want that to be lower they want that to
 
07:26:47.350 --> 07:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
be 18 students um you know in an
 
07:26:49.510 --> 07:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
elementary school maybe even lower for a
 
07:26:51.590 --> 07:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
kindergarten class so those are local
 
07:26:54.070 --> 07:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
values that are adopted by local school
 
07:26:56.708 --> 07:26:56.718 align:start position:0%
boards and then reflective in the budget
 
07:26:58.948 --> 07:26:58.958 align:start position:0%
in conclusion i'll say that there are
 
07:27:01.110 --> 07:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
already three mechanisms in law by which
 
07:27:04.708 --> 07:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
voters have the opportunity to limit
 
07:27:07.030 --> 07:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
school district budgets the first is rsa
 
07:27:10.788 --> 07:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
32 colon 5-c as in cat that's a local
 
07:27:13.590 --> 07:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
tax cap this bill is a local budget cap
 
07:27:16.310 --> 07:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
the preceding provision in rsa 32 coin 5
 
07:27:18.548 --> 07:27:18.558 align:start position:0%
would be a local tax cap i don't know
 
07:27:21.430 --> 07:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
how many districts have adopted that
 
07:27:23.350 --> 07:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
we know many of our cities have have tax
 
07:27:25.510 --> 07:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
caps commune towns and school districts
 
07:27:26.868 --> 07:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many have adopted that
 
07:27:26.878 --> 07:27:29.270 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many have adopted that
statewide

07:27:29.270 --> 07:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
07:27:32.150 --> 07:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
the second is um sb2 many communities
 
07:27:34.468 --> 07:27:34.478 align:start position:0%
have adopted sb2 over the last 25 years
 
07:27:35.910 --> 07:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
in an attempt to go to the deliberative
 
07:27:38.628 --> 07:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
session and have a discussion and
 
07:27:41.190 --> 07:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully increase turnout you can make
 
07:27:43.190 --> 07:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
motions from the floor about decreasing
 
07:27:44.868 --> 07:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
you know your budget or increasing your
 
07:27:44.878 --> 07:27:45.830 align:start position:0%
you know your budget or increasing your
budget

07:27:45.830 --> 07:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
budget
 
07:27:48.230 --> 07:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
and last it's always been in
 
07:27:48.240 --> 07:27:48.948 align:start position:0%
and last it's always been in
my

07:27:48.948 --> 07:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
my
 
07:27:50.628 --> 07:27:50.638 align:start position:0%
personal opinion not necessarily a
 
07:27:53.270 --> 07:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
position of nhsba that if the voters
 
07:27:55.350 --> 07:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
want to increase or decrease a budget
 
07:27:56.548 --> 07:27:56.558 align:start position:0%
they can come out to their annual
 
07:27:58.310 --> 07:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
meeting and do that and convince their
 
07:28:00.150 --> 07:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
neighbors if they make a motion to cut
 
07:28:01.990 --> 07:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
the budget so we think there are
 
07:28:05.030 --> 07:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
sufficient provisions already in law
 
07:28:08.628 --> 07:28:08.638 align:start position:0%
that are are prudent and reasonable
 
07:28:10.948 --> 07:28:10.958 align:start position:0%
fiscal constraints that school boards
 
07:28:12.150 --> 07:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
may face
 
07:28:14.070 --> 07:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
with the voters having complete say over
 
07:28:16.468 --> 07:28:16.478 align:start position:0%
the adopted budget and then the larger
 
07:28:18.628 --> 07:28:18.638 align:start position:0%
issue is some of the the costs that we
 
07:28:20.628 --> 07:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
simply you know can't you know we have
 
07:28:22.150 --> 07:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
to find a way to absorb because they're
 
07:28:24.150 --> 07:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
obligations while still trying to
 
07:28:25.750 --> 07:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
balance providing an education and
 
07:28:27.670 --> 07:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
trying to provide a balance for what
 
07:28:30.388 --> 07:28:30.398 align:start position:0%
taxpayers can actually afford so thank
 
07:28:32.150 --> 07:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
you mr chair with that i'm happy to
 
07:28:35.830 --> 07:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:37.750 --> 07:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i didn't know you had
 
07:28:37.760 --> 07:28:38.468 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i didn't know you had
a

07:28:38.468 --> 07:28:38.478 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:28:40.948 --> 07:28:40.958 align:start position:0%
eye on your side
 
07:28:42.548 --> 07:28:42.558 align:start position:0%
political vision
 
07:28:45.430 --> 07:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
better thank you thank you for taking my
 
07:28:46.868 --> 07:28:46.878 align:start position:0%
question you
 
07:28:49.910 --> 07:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
you alluded to a lot of concerns that i
 
07:28:53.430 --> 07:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
have in terms of this uh bill
 
07:28:55.990 --> 07:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
how do you account does this take into
 
07:28:58.468 --> 07:28:58.478 align:start position:0%
account the bubble that we saw
 
07:29:01.030 --> 07:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know the population bubble when
 
07:29:04.468 --> 07:29:04.478 align:start position:0%
there is a big uh influx in kindergarten
 
07:29:06.868 --> 07:29:06.878 align:start position:0%
and you have to accommodate them to go
 
07:29:10.468 --> 07:29:10.478 align:start position:0%
through for the next 12 years right
 
07:29:12.788 --> 07:29:12.798 align:start position:0%
is a big uh challenge with this kind of
 
07:29:12.798 --> 07:29:13.830 align:start position:0%
is a big uh challenge with this kind of
uh

07:29:13.830 --> 07:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:29:15.190 --> 07:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
it is thank you for the question
 
07:29:16.628 --> 07:29:16.638 align:start position:0%
representative i didn't mean to
 
07:29:19.510 --> 07:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
interrupt you um you know i'm looking at
 
07:29:19.520 --> 07:29:21.030 align:start position:0%
interrupt you um you know i'm looking at
um

07:29:21.030 --> 07:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:29:22.788 --> 07:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
page one i believe it's line seven where
 
07:29:23.990 --> 07:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
it talks about the average daily
 
07:29:25.990 --> 07:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
membership of the school district
 
07:29:29.510 --> 07:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
currently our um well yes we've had
 
07:29:32.150 --> 07:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
numbers of kids um not you know
 
07:29:33.910 --> 07:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment over the last 20
 
07:29:33.920 --> 07:29:34.868 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment over the last 20
years

07:29:34.868 --> 07:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
years
 
07:29:37.830 --> 07:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
because of covid our current enrollment
 
07:29:37.840 --> 07:29:38.868 align:start position:0%
because of covid our current enrollment
numbers

07:29:38.868 --> 07:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
07:29:38.878 --> 07:29:41.270 align:start position:0%
numbers
are

07:29:41.270 --> 07:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
07:29:43.910 --> 07:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
are not accurate if i think is the best
 
07:29:47.510 --> 07:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
way to say it for example for the 2020
 
07:29:50.868 --> 07:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
21 covet hit march of 12 of 2020
 
07:29:53.990 --> 07:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
for the 2021 school district we saw a
 
07:29:56.070 --> 07:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
significant drop in the number of
 
07:29:58.788 --> 07:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
children enrolled in kindergarten why
 
07:30:00.868 --> 07:30:00.878 align:start position:0%
because some of the schools were doing
 
07:30:02.708 --> 07:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
it virtual why am i going to in
 
07:30:05.110 --> 07:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote enroll my five-year-old in
 
07:30:06.948 --> 07:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
a kindergarten program it might be a
 
07:30:08.230 --> 07:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
half day kinder program when they're
 
07:30:10.230 --> 07:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
going to be staring at a zoom i'll try
 
07:30:12.070 --> 07:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
and get to my local library or find some
 
07:30:13.990 --> 07:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
instructional videos on youtube so we
 
07:30:16.468 --> 07:30:16.478 align:start position:0%
didn't we saw those you know those
 
07:30:18.788 --> 07:30:18.798 align:start position:0%
numbers artificially declined we also
 
07:30:21.910 --> 07:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
saw a number of students um
 
07:30:23.830 --> 07:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
07:30:25.510 --> 07:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
quote unquote leave the public school
 
07:30:28.150 --> 07:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
for maybe a private school that was open
 
07:30:29.430 --> 07:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
but then they're coming back into the
 
07:30:30.868 --> 07:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
public school now that our school
 
07:30:32.708 --> 07:30:32.718 align:start position:0%
districts are back open so it was a
 
07:30:32.718 --> 07:30:34.388 align:start position:0%
districts are back open so it was a
temporary

07:30:34.388 --> 07:30:34.398 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
07:30:37.350 --> 07:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
dip in rise in our in our enrollments at
 
07:30:39.590 --> 07:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
least for the last two years so
 
07:30:42.788 --> 07:30:42.798 align:start position:0%
um and you make again a good point um i
 
07:30:43.830 --> 07:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
07:30:45.350 --> 07:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
the kindergarten numbers but if a
 
07:30:47.430 --> 07:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
district has a half day
 
07:30:49.270 --> 07:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
kindergarten program right now and then
 
07:30:50.948 --> 07:30:50.958 align:start position:0%
they move to a full day kindergarten
 
07:30:52.150 --> 07:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
program right now i believe i don't
 
07:30:53.430 --> 07:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
think they're getting state aid for that
 
07:30:55.670 --> 07:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
so they may not factor into the um the
 
07:30:57.430 --> 07:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
average daily membership that i had to
 
07:30:59.270 --> 07:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
go back and check but still is a
 
07:31:01.030 --> 07:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
fluctuation in our student numbers that
 
07:31:03.270 --> 07:31:03.280 align:start position:0%

bill
um

07:31:39.430 --> 07:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:31:41.910 --> 07:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
i'll be very brief because i think the
 
07:31:43.990 --> 07:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
between the questions that were raised
 
07:31:46.310 --> 07:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
in the committee as well as mr
 
07:31:48.868 --> 07:31:48.878 align:start position:0%
christina's testimony i think a lot of
 
07:31:48.878 --> 07:31:49.910 align:start position:0%
christina's testimony i think a lot of
our

07:31:49.910 --> 07:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
our
 
07:31:51.190 --> 07:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
we share
 
07:31:55.350 --> 07:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of the same concerns um
 
07:31:58.150 --> 07:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
what i would uh just emphasize and add
 
07:32:00.868 --> 07:32:00.878 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
07:32:02.868 --> 07:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
during some of the testimo
 
07:32:05.510 --> 07:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
the first testimony we heard a lot about
 
07:32:08.628 --> 07:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
you know what how do we deal with the uh
 
07:32:10.788 --> 07:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
the things that come up and that and
 
07:32:13.270 --> 07:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
that the answer to that was
 
07:32:15.190 --> 07:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
we need you know you need to take that
 
07:32:17.590 --> 07:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
into account when you're setting these
 
07:32:19.190 --> 07:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
initial numbers that you're going to be
 
07:32:22.548 --> 07:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
going by for potentially
 
07:32:23.990 --> 07:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity
 
07:32:24.000 --> 07:32:26.310 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity
and

07:32:26.310 --> 07:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:32:28.070 --> 07:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot of the questions that i
 
07:32:30.150 --> 07:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
think committee members asked about the
 
07:32:31.670 --> 07:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
various things
 
07:32:31.680 --> 07:32:32.468 align:start position:0%
various things
that

07:32:32.468 --> 07:32:32.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:32:34.310 --> 07:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
can come up
 
07:32:34.320 --> 07:32:35.270 align:start position:0%
can come up
and

07:32:35.270 --> 07:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:32:38.388 --> 07:32:38.398 align:start position:0%
how do you balance those competing
 
07:32:40.468 --> 07:32:40.478 align:start position:0%
priorities it's through your annual
 
07:32:42.468 --> 07:32:42.478 align:start position:0%
budget process that we have
 
07:32:44.788 --> 07:32:44.798 align:start position:0%
and so we think that that is
 
07:32:44.798 --> 07:32:46.548 align:start position:0%
and so we think that that is
a

07:32:46.548 --> 07:32:46.558 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:32:48.150 --> 07:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
an adequate
 
07:32:50.468 --> 07:32:50.478 align:start position:0%
uh method by which we should continue to
 
07:32:51.750 --> 07:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
operate by
 
07:32:54.070 --> 07:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh another piece i just wanted to raise
 
07:32:54.080 --> 07:32:55.670 align:start position:0%
uh another piece i just wanted to raise
is

07:32:55.670 --> 07:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:32:58.948 --> 07:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
the the initial number that um gets
 
07:33:01.030 --> 07:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
approved uh when we're when we're
 
07:33:02.948 --> 07:33:02.958 align:start position:0%
putting the question
 
07:33:05.910 --> 07:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
to uh voters
 
07:33:08.948 --> 07:33:08.958 align:start position:0%
if that initial dollar amount
 
07:33:11.270 --> 07:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
is not adequate
 
07:33:11.280 --> 07:33:12.468 align:start position:0%
is not adequate
um

07:33:12.468 --> 07:33:12.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:33:15.030 --> 07:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
if this is if this comes in because as i
 
07:33:17.910 --> 07:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
read this it can come in by petition
 
07:33:21.510 --> 07:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
and it is set at a number that is too
 
07:33:21.520 --> 07:33:23.110 align:start position:0%
and it is set at a number that is too
low

07:33:23.110 --> 07:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
low
 
07:33:24.788 --> 07:33:24.798 align:start position:0%
and it is approved
 
07:33:24.798 --> 07:33:25.990 align:start position:0%
and it is approved
um

07:33:25.990 --> 07:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:33:28.230 --> 07:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
it is it is going to be very difficult
 
07:33:29.190 --> 07:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
for the
 
07:33:30.788 --> 07:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
for the school district
 
07:33:30.798 --> 07:33:31.830 align:start position:0%
for the school district
uh

07:33:31.830 --> 07:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:33:33.990 --> 07:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
to adapt for the students that it that
 
07:33:35.990 --> 07:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
it has and so
 
07:33:39.110 --> 07:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
um i i just wanted to add those
 
07:33:41.510 --> 07:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
um pieces and and
 
07:33:44.548 --> 07:33:44.558 align:start position:0%
um i'll conclude my testimony there and
 
07:33:46.468 --> 07:33:46.478 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
07:33:49.110 --> 07:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
07:33:51.990 --> 07:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
07:33:56.628 --> 07:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
you mr chair i'll be very quick and um
 
07:33:58.150 --> 07:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
in tr how
 
07:34:01.270 --> 07:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
agile can school district be in terms of
 
07:34:03.190 --> 07:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
their staff
 
07:34:05.430 --> 07:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
and that's a huge cost of the school
 
07:34:07.110 --> 07:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
budget and
 
07:34:09.910 --> 07:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
can they be fired and hired
 
07:34:10.868 --> 07:34:10.878 align:start position:0%
on a
 
07:34:13.910 --> 07:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh how would that impact us education of
 
07:34:16.788 --> 07:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
the students well i i think the the the
 
07:34:18.548 --> 07:34:18.558 align:start position:0%
biggest impact
 
07:34:21.190 --> 07:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh concern we would have is is is for
 
07:34:23.430 --> 07:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
the students so if you have a couple of
 
07:34:25.510 --> 07:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
students who end up the
 
07:34:27.430 --> 07:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
the enrollment goes down you still have
 
07:34:28.628 --> 07:34:28.638 align:start position:0%
to have the teacher you still have to
 
07:34:30.230 --> 07:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
have the para educator you still have to
 
07:34:30.240 --> 07:34:31.110 align:start position:0%
have the para educator you still have to
have

07:34:31.110 --> 07:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:34:33.430 --> 07:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
all of those
 
07:34:34.948 --> 07:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
of things and so
 
07:34:34.958 --> 07:34:36.310 align:start position:0%
of things and so
um

07:34:36.310 --> 07:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:34:38.150 --> 07:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
i think the biggest concern
 
07:34:40.708 --> 07:34:40.718 align:start position:0%
would be you know what what happens to
 
07:34:42.708 --> 07:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
class sizes and the quality of education
 
07:34:45.190 --> 07:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
that the students would have and um
 
07:34:45.200 --> 07:34:46.310 align:start position:0%
that the students would have and um
that

07:34:46.310 --> 07:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:34:47.670 --> 07:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
can be
 
07:34:49.430 --> 07:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
best determined by a majority of the
 
07:34:51.750 --> 07:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
voters at their annual town meeting and
 
07:34:53.670 --> 07:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
they're elected uh and their elected
 
07:34:59.270 --> 07:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:00.708 --> 07:35:00.718 align:start position:0%

and it takes you all your concentration

rsa 21 colon 50.
 
07:37:42.708 --> 07:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
under current new hampshire law veteran
 
07:37:45.270 --> 07:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
means any person who
 
07:37:47.750 --> 07:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
served in the armed forces for more than
 
07:37:51.190 --> 07:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
four years and continues to serve
 
07:37:51.200 --> 07:37:52.948 align:start position:0%
four years and continues to serve
or

07:37:52.948 --> 07:37:52.958 align:start position:0%
or
 
07:37:55.030 --> 07:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
a person who has been honorably
 
07:37:57.230 --> 07:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
discharged or received an
 
07:38:00.070 --> 07:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
uncharacterized discharge based on a
 
07:38:03.510 --> 07:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
service connected injury illness or
 
07:38:03.520 --> 07:38:05.190 align:start position:0%
service connected injury illness or
disability

07:38:05.190 --> 07:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
disability
 
07:38:07.670 --> 07:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
the issue that this bill addresses is
 
07:38:11.190 --> 07:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
that the veterans tax credit statutes in
 
07:38:13.110 --> 07:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
section 72
 
07:38:15.590 --> 07:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
do not align with the definition of a
 
07:38:19.910 --> 07:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
veteran under rsa 21 colon 50.
 
07:38:19.920 --> 07:38:20.788 align:start position:0%
veteran under rsa 21 colon 50.
thus

07:38:20.788 --> 07:38:20.798 align:start position:0%
thus
 
07:38:23.750 --> 07:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
armed force forces members who are in
 
07:38:26.388 --> 07:38:26.398 align:start position:0%
fact veterans under new hampshire law
 
07:38:29.270 --> 07:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
are not considered to be veterans which
 
07:38:30.468 --> 07:38:30.478 align:start position:0%
is both
 
07:38:33.350 --> 07:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
which is a significant discrepancy
 
07:38:36.468 --> 07:38:36.478 align:start position:0%
as a result of this inconsistency
 
07:38:39.190 --> 07:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
currently serving veterans do not
 
07:38:42.230 --> 07:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
qualify for any of the veterans tax
 
07:38:42.240 --> 07:38:43.270 align:start position:0%
qualify for any of the veterans tax
credits

07:38:43.270 --> 07:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
credits
 
07:38:46.948 --> 07:38:46.958 align:start position:0%
including the all veterans tax credit
 
07:38:49.350 --> 07:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
which is incongruent with the section
 
07:38:49.360 --> 07:38:50.788 align:start position:0%
which is incongruent with the section
title

07:38:50.788 --> 07:38:50.798 align:start position:0%
title
 
07:38:53.350 --> 07:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
the remedy that this bill provides is
 
07:38:55.750 --> 07:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
simple and straightforward
 
07:38:57.830 --> 07:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
this bill amends the language in the
 
07:38:59.910 --> 07:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
standard and optional veterans tax
 
07:39:02.388 --> 07:39:02.398 align:start position:0%
credit and the all veterans tax credit
 
07:39:06.150 --> 07:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
to include those veterans still serving
 
07:39:09.670 --> 07:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
consist consistent with the statutory
 
07:39:11.910 --> 07:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
definition of veteran
 
07:39:14.150 --> 07:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
additionally the current language in
 
07:39:17.190 --> 07:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
these sections only counts title 10
 
07:39:19.990 --> 07:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
training for active duty
 
07:39:21.670 --> 07:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
title 10 is a
 
07:39:23.910 --> 07:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
federally funded and federally
 
07:39:26.150 --> 07:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
controlled status
 
07:39:26.160 --> 07:39:27.190 align:start position:0%
controlled status
however

07:39:27.190 --> 07:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
however
 
07:39:29.590 --> 07:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
since national guardsmen perform a
 
07:39:31.830 --> 07:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
majority of their duties
 
07:39:34.468 --> 07:39:34.478 align:start position:0%
in title 32 status
 
07:39:36.868 --> 07:39:36.878 align:start position:0%
which is a state-controlled but
 
07:39:39.030 --> 07:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
federally funded status
 
07:39:42.310 --> 07:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
this bill removes title 10 from both
 
07:39:46.310 --> 07:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
sections so that both title 10 and title
 
07:39:50.388 --> 07:39:50.398 align:start position:0%
32 service qualifies for the 90-day
 
07:39:50.398 --> 07:39:52.070 align:start position:0%
32 service qualifies for the 90-day
requirement

07:39:52.070 --> 07:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
07:39:52.080 --> 07:39:53.190 align:start position:0%
requirement
lastly

07:39:53.190 --> 07:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
lastly
 
07:39:56.310 --> 07:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
under the all veterans tax credit state
 
07:39:58.468 --> 07:39:58.478 align:start position:0%
active duty is also included as
 
07:40:01.830 --> 07:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
qualifying service in this bill
 
07:40:04.548 --> 07:40:04.558 align:start position:0%
towards the 90 days since the status is
 
07:40:07.030 --> 07:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
commonly used when guardsmen respond to
 
07:40:10.230 --> 07:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
natural disasters emergencies and other
 
07:40:10.240 --> 07:40:11.830 align:start position:0%
natural disasters emergencies and other
contingencies

07:40:11.830 --> 07:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
contingencies
 
07:40:13.350 --> 07:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
which is one of the missions and
 
07:40:16.310 --> 07:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
functions of the national guard
 
07:40:18.310 --> 07:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
07:40:21.590 --> 07:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
this bill clarifies that title 32 and
 
07:40:24.388 --> 07:40:24.398 align:start position:0%
state active duty by national guardsmen
 
07:40:27.510 --> 07:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
counts towards the 90-day requirement to
 
07:40:30.388 --> 07:40:30.398 align:start position:0%
qualify for the veterans tax credits
 
07:40:33.150 --> 07:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
and this bill also addresses the
 
07:40:35.990 --> 07:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies between the term veteran
 
07:40:39.590 --> 07:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
as defined in rsa 21 colon 50 which
 
07:40:42.070 --> 07:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
includes currently serving members as
 
07:40:44.948 --> 07:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
veterans in rsa 72
 
07:40:47.430 --> 07:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
the veterans tax credit sections
 
07:40:49.830 --> 07:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
which currently specifies that members
 
07:40:52.468 --> 07:40:52.478 align:start position:0%
have to be separated in order to be
 
07:40:54.708 --> 07:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
eligible for the tax credits
 
07:40:56.628 --> 07:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
mr chair that concludes my bill
 
07:40:58.310 --> 07:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
introduction i'm happy to answer any
 
07:41:00.388 --> 07:41:00.398 align:start position:0%
questions if you allow any questions for
 
07:41:01.990 --> 07:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
the representative yes representative
 
07:41:02.000 --> 07:41:04.150 align:start position:0%
the representative yes representative
please

07:41:04.150 --> 07:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
please
 
07:41:06.310 --> 07:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
07:41:07.830 --> 07:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
07:41:10.788 --> 07:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
um there's no fiscal note on this as has
 
07:41:12.548 --> 07:41:12.558 align:start position:0%
been with all the others so
 
07:41:14.708 --> 07:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to ask for that but
 
07:41:16.230 --> 07:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
would you know
 
07:41:19.270 --> 07:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
the amount of impact this will have on
 
07:41:21.030 --> 07:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
each of the municipalities i i'm not
 
07:41:22.388 --> 07:41:22.398 align:start position:0%
disagreeing that we should have
 
07:41:24.388 --> 07:41:24.398 align:start position:0%
clarifying language
 
07:41:27.510 --> 07:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
um consistency consistently but
 
07:41:29.910 --> 07:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
my curiosity is especially once we put
 
07:41:32.070 --> 07:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
in state active
 
07:41:34.468 --> 07:41:34.478 align:start position:0%
duty and so on this could have a very
 
07:41:36.948 --> 07:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
large impact on on the shift it's not
 
07:41:38.468 --> 07:41:38.478 align:start position:0%
going to cost municipalities but the
 
07:41:41.510 --> 07:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
shift of a burden of tax do you have
 
07:41:43.430 --> 07:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
any idea as to what percentage this
 
07:41:44.788 --> 07:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
could be because i assume all our
 
07:41:47.430 --> 07:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
national guards may not be homeowners
 
07:41:48.468 --> 07:41:48.478 align:start position:0%
but they
 
07:41:49.590 --> 07:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
they could
 
07:41:51.990 --> 07:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
um they could be okay thank you for the
 
07:41:54.070 --> 07:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
question representative i do not have
 
07:41:56.468 --> 07:41:56.478 align:start position:0%
any data or statistics to to answer your
 
07:41:58.310 --> 07:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
question however we do know that less
 
07:41:59.750 --> 07:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
than one percent
 
07:42:02.388 --> 07:42:02.398 align:start position:0%
of the people in our country
 
07:42:05.590 --> 07:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
serve in the armed forces therefore
 
07:42:07.430 --> 07:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
i would say that
 
07:42:09.990 --> 07:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
in total it would be you know less than
 
07:42:14.468 --> 07:42:14.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:18.628 --> 07:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:20.388 --> 07:42:20.398 align:start position:0%
is it isn't it true that i think new
 
07:42:20.398 --> 07:42:21.510 align:start position:0%
is it isn't it true that i think new
hampshire

07:42:21.510 --> 07:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
07:42:21.520 --> 07:42:23.750 align:start position:0%
hampshire
um

07:42:23.750 --> 07:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:42:26.230 --> 07:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
per population has a much higher
 
07:42:28.388 --> 07:42:28.398 align:start position:0%
percentage of veterans we're we're very
 
07:42:30.948 --> 07:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
fed veteran friendly um state which is
 
07:42:34.548 --> 07:42:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:37.750 --> 07:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
um i'm not with the question was
 
07:42:40.310 --> 07:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
do i know or do i agree or no would i
 
07:42:40.320 --> 07:42:41.270 align:start position:0%
do i know or do i agree or no would i
believe

07:42:41.270 --> 07:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
believe
 
07:42:44.150 --> 07:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
no no neither would i i just wanted to
 
07:42:46.708 --> 07:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
know if um
 
07:42:48.150 --> 07:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
i guess yes
 
07:42:50.150 --> 07:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
are you aware are you aware that was my
 
07:42:52.230 --> 07:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
question i'm not we are i'm not
 
07:42:54.468 --> 07:42:54.478 align:start position:0%
specifically aware but what i would say
 
07:42:58.468 --> 07:42:58.478 align:start position:0%
is um you know it depends on the town
 
07:43:00.788 --> 07:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
07:43:02.310 --> 07:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
i mean that would be that would take a
 
07:43:03.590 --> 07:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
07:43:05.830 --> 07:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
research to do and i would also add that
 
07:43:05.840 --> 07:43:08.388 align:start position:0%
research to do and i would also add that
this

07:43:08.388 --> 07:43:08.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:11.270 --> 07:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
these veterans tax credits are enabling
 
07:43:14.230 --> 07:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
so the municipality would have to
 
07:43:15.430 --> 07:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:43:17.990 --> 07:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
adopt it locally and additionally
 
07:43:20.868 --> 07:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
it's not automatic the service member
 
07:43:22.548 --> 07:43:22.558 align:start position:0%
must apply
 
07:43:23.910 --> 07:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
and they must
 
07:43:26.310 --> 07:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
you know have the proper application and
 
07:43:28.310 --> 07:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
all the proper documentation so it's not
 
07:43:31.110 --> 07:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
an automatic given there's many steps
 
07:43:33.590 --> 07:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
that that you know one would need to to
 
07:43:35.750 --> 07:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
go through it's just not not automatic
 
07:43:38.070 --> 07:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
to say well we have x percent
 
07:43:38.080 --> 07:43:38.948 align:start position:0%
to say well we have x percent
of

07:43:38.948 --> 07:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:43:41.270 --> 07:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
uniformed service members therefore it's
 
07:43:43.910 --> 07:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
going to have this impact we do not know
 
07:43:43.920 --> 07:43:45.030 align:start position:0%
going to have this impact we do not know
until

07:43:45.030 --> 07:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
until
 
07:43:47.030 --> 07:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
um they apply
 
07:43:50.070 --> 07:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up sir one more yes
 
07:43:50.080 --> 07:43:50.788 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up sir one more yes
um

07:43:50.788 --> 07:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:43:52.868 --> 07:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
it'll just be quick um
 
07:43:54.708 --> 07:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
you said that it's enabling which which
 
07:43:56.708 --> 07:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
i agree with but if it's already in
 
07:44:00.070 --> 07:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
existence we would be adding more to the
 
07:44:02.230 --> 07:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
existing group is that correct
 
07:44:05.270 --> 07:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
that is that is correct that this bill
 
07:44:05.280 --> 07:44:06.708 align:start position:0%
that is that is correct that this bill
amends

07:44:06.708 --> 07:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
amends
 
07:44:12.230 --> 07:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:16.628 --> 07:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:18.948 --> 07:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
when a person is is
 
07:44:20.628 --> 07:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
in the service
 
07:44:23.990 --> 07:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
when they re-enlist or they change
 
07:44:24.000 --> 07:44:25.190 align:start position:0%
when they re-enlist or they change
status

07:44:25.190 --> 07:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
status
 
07:44:28.070 --> 07:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
in many cases they get what's called a
 
07:44:28.080 --> 07:44:30.628 align:start position:0%
in many cases they get what's called a
dd-214

07:44:30.628 --> 07:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
dd-214
 
07:44:30.638 --> 07:44:31.750 align:start position:0%
dd-214
which

07:44:31.750 --> 07:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
07:44:34.230 --> 07:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases
 
07:44:34.240 --> 07:44:35.468 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases
in

07:44:35.468 --> 07:44:35.478 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:44:38.310 --> 07:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities all you have to do is
 
07:44:41.910 --> 07:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
present a dd 214 and you're considered a
 
07:44:41.920 --> 07:44:43.510 align:start position:0%
present a dd 214 and you're considered a
veteran

07:44:43.510 --> 07:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
veteran
 
07:44:45.030 --> 07:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
even though i
 
07:44:47.110 --> 07:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
my my
 
07:44:49.350 --> 07:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
my theory is
 
07:44:52.310 --> 07:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
that the impact of this law
 
07:44:56.468 --> 07:44:56.478 align:start position:0%
is going to be minimized because a lot
 
07:45:00.788 --> 07:45:00.798 align:start position:0%
of towns are not processing it correctly
 
07:45:04.230 --> 07:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
by the law they're they're giving people
 
07:45:07.270 --> 07:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
that are in the guard or the reserves
 
07:45:09.670 --> 07:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the doubt and considering
 
07:45:11.030 --> 07:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
them veterans
 
07:45:14.070 --> 07:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
even though they aren't by law
 
07:45:16.830 --> 07:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
would you agree with
 
07:45:21.270 --> 07:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:21.280 --> 07:45:22.548 align:start position:0%
 
touche

07:45:22.548 --> 07:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
touche
 
07:45:22.558 --> 07:45:24.230 align:start position:0%
touche
um

07:45:24.230 --> 07:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:45:27.350 --> 07:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
i i just i just think that the impact of
 
07:45:29.110 --> 07:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
this change
 
07:45:31.270 --> 07:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
i agree with the change i don't have a
 
07:45:32.708 --> 07:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
problem with that
 
07:45:34.868 --> 07:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
but the the impact is going to be
 
07:45:34.878 --> 07:45:35.990 align:start position:0%
but the the impact is going to be
lessened

07:45:35.990 --> 07:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
lessened
 
07:45:36.000 --> 07:45:37.430 align:start position:0%
lessened
because

07:45:37.430 --> 07:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:45:39.910 --> 07:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of towns aren't following the law
 
07:45:39.920 --> 07:45:41.030 align:start position:0%
a lot of towns aren't following the law
now

07:45:41.030 --> 07:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
07:45:43.430 --> 07:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
they're being more liberal
 
07:45:44.830 --> 07:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
than the law
 
07:45:47.190 --> 07:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
allows okay well thank you for the
 
07:45:49.350 --> 07:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
07:45:51.190 --> 07:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
towns should be following the law so
 
07:45:53.670 --> 07:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
that's disappointing that they're being
 
07:45:56.310 --> 07:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
um i guess loosey-goosey with it that's
 
07:45:57.830 --> 07:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's improper
 
07:46:00.468 --> 07:46:00.478 align:start position:0%
and um i would also ask that you perhaps
 
07:46:00.478 --> 07:46:01.750 align:start position:0%
and um i would also ask that you perhaps
defer

07:46:01.750 --> 07:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
defer
 
07:46:05.110 --> 07:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
and ask the question of um
 
07:46:07.270 --> 07:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
someone who's going to provide testimony
 
07:46:08.628 --> 07:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
who is
 
07:46:09.910 --> 07:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
a retired
 
07:46:12.868 --> 07:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
air force officer and also a squadron
 
07:46:15.190 --> 07:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
commit had been a squadron commander and
 
07:46:17.670 --> 07:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
is more versed in um
 
07:46:19.830 --> 07:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
the the details and the ins and outs of
 
07:46:22.230 --> 07:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
those forms that you refer to i know
 
07:46:24.230 --> 07:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
that there are a number of forms it's
 
07:46:26.868 --> 07:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
just not one so that individual can
 
07:46:28.868 --> 07:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
speak better to
 
07:46:31.270 --> 07:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
the question that you're posing okay i
 
07:46:33.990 --> 07:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
was not in the military
 
07:46:34.000 --> 07:46:34.868 align:start position:0%
was not in the military
yes

07:46:34.868 --> 07:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:46:34.878 --> 07:46:37.750 align:start position:0%
yes
representative

07:46:37.750 --> 07:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:38.868 --> 07:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
07:46:41.510 --> 07:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
07:46:43.948 --> 07:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
again can't look at everything in a silo
 
07:46:46.948 --> 07:46:46.958 align:start position:0%
1375 that we have which changes
 
07:46:46.958 --> 07:46:48.628 align:start position:0%
1375 that we have which changes
honorably

07:46:48.628 --> 07:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
honorably
 
07:46:52.708 --> 07:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
discharged to discharged with honor
 
07:46:55.030 --> 07:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
always have to assume you can never
 
07:46:57.110 --> 07:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
assume that that something is going to
 
07:47:00.388 --> 07:47:00.398 align:start position:0%
happen let's say 1375 does not pass
 
07:47:04.948 --> 07:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
we understood with 1375 that discharged
 
07:47:07.430 --> 07:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
with honor and honorably discharged are
 
07:47:09.430 --> 07:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
different things
 
07:47:10.548 --> 07:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
i didn't know that i wasn't in the
 
07:47:13.270 --> 07:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
military does your bill need to be
 
07:47:16.548 --> 07:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
amended to say discharge with honor or
 
07:47:18.628 --> 07:47:18.638 align:start position:0%
separated with honor
 
07:47:21.030 --> 07:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
in order to capture
 
07:47:23.510 --> 07:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
all of those people who might
 
07:47:23.520 --> 07:47:24.548 align:start position:0%
all of those people who might
benefit

07:47:24.548 --> 07:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
07:47:26.070 --> 07:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
from it does it make any sense because
 
07:47:27.910 --> 07:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
we learned in 1375 there are people who
 
07:47:32.070 --> 07:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:33.910 --> 07:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
could you thank you for the question
 
07:47:36.830 --> 07:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative so you're you're
 
07:47:39.910 --> 07:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
asking with regard to an amendment to
 
07:47:45.110 --> 07:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:47.590 --> 07:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
which line would you be would you be
 
07:47:47.600 --> 07:47:48.948 align:start position:0%
which line would you be would you be
referencing

07:47:48.948 --> 07:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
referencing
 
07:47:52.230 --> 07:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes thank you so again i'm
 
07:47:53.990 --> 07:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
referring back and i apologize that
 
07:47:57.030 --> 07:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
maybe i should have prefaced it 1375 was
 
07:47:59.670 --> 07:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
introduced to us a while back to say
 
07:48:02.230 --> 07:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
honorably discharged and discharged with
 
07:48:05.590 --> 07:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
honor are two very different things
 
07:48:08.388 --> 07:48:08.398 align:start position:0%
and therefore i wonder here where in
 
07:48:11.910 --> 07:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
parent a you say or what with the
 
07:48:15.030 --> 07:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
statute says was honorably discharged
 
07:48:17.110 --> 07:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
and where it's honorably separated it
 
07:48:19.030 --> 07:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
goes on to say that i think a few times
 
07:48:22.070 --> 07:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
does that phrase also need to be changed
 
07:48:23.670 --> 07:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
so that we capture
 
07:48:25.670 --> 07:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
the full group of people that could
 
07:48:27.510 --> 07:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
benefit from this
 
07:48:30.150 --> 07:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
bill so i might refer you thank you for
 
07:48:32.070 --> 07:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
the question representative so i might
 
07:48:33.510 --> 07:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
refer you to
 
07:48:36.230 --> 07:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
section 21 colon 50 that does define
 
07:48:39.830 --> 07:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
veteran and it also goes on to
 
07:48:42.990 --> 07:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
define an honorable discharge or the
 
07:48:45.350 --> 07:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
uncharacterized discharge
 
07:48:47.270 --> 07:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
based on a service connected injury
 
07:48:49.590 --> 07:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
illness or disability that may be
 
07:48:49.600 --> 07:48:51.270 align:start position:0%
illness or disability that may be
encompassing

07:48:51.270 --> 07:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
encompassing
 
07:48:51.280 --> 07:48:52.788 align:start position:0%
encompassing
that

07:48:52.788 --> 07:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:48:55.030 --> 07:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
group of people that you're
 
07:48:57.510 --> 07:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
referencing to put an amendment
 
07:48:57.520 --> 07:48:58.468 align:start position:0%
referencing to put an amendment
to

07:48:58.468 --> 07:48:58.478 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:48:58.478 --> 07:48:59.990 align:start position:0%
to
yes

07:48:59.990 --> 07:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:49:01.430 --> 07:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and that's actually the
 
07:49:03.750 --> 07:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
question because 1375
 
07:49:08.788 --> 07:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:11.670 --> 07:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:17.270 --> 07:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
so house bill 1375 looks to amend 21 50
 
07:49:19.670 --> 07:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
to change honorably discharged to
 
07:49:21.830 --> 07:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
discharge without by the way i i think
 
07:49:23.270 --> 07:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea i just want to make
 
07:49:24.388 --> 07:49:24.398 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
07:49:26.230 --> 07:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
we we're capturing all the right things
 
07:49:27.990 --> 07:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
and it may just be an administrative
 
07:49:29.750 --> 07:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
thing we may just have to
 
07:49:31.030 --> 07:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
you know do that i just want to make
 
07:49:32.468 --> 07:49:32.478 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not missing something
 
07:49:33.670 --> 07:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
07:49:36.468 --> 07:49:36.478 align:start position:0%
question um
 
07:49:38.388 --> 07:49:38.398 align:start position:0%
my focus
 
07:49:40.948 --> 07:49:40.958 align:start position:0%
i i i appreciate that the question and
 
07:49:44.868 --> 07:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
my focus is on this bill that i'm prime
 
07:49:47.670 --> 07:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
sponsoring and you know i
 
07:49:50.948 --> 07:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
to be honest i have not reflected on the
 
07:49:52.388 --> 07:49:52.398 align:start position:0%
previous bill
 
07:49:55.030 --> 07:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
and to to for the purposes of this
 
07:49:55.040 --> 07:49:56.070 align:start position:0%
and to to for the purposes of this
hearing

07:49:56.070 --> 07:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
07:49:56.080 --> 07:49:56.948 align:start position:0%
hearing
to

07:49:56.948 --> 07:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:49:56.958 --> 07:49:58.868 align:start position:0%
to
um

07:49:58.868 --> 07:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:50:00.150 --> 07:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
to consider
 
07:50:02.708 --> 07:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
how that bill if it were to be passed
 
07:50:05.190 --> 07:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
how this bill here in front of us might
 
07:50:07.350 --> 07:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
need to be amended so i can't
 
07:50:09.750 --> 07:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately can't answer that sitting
 
07:50:11.910 --> 07:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
here right now i would need to take some
 
07:50:14.230 --> 07:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
time to carefully analyze that and
 
07:50:16.948 --> 07:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
reflect and consider
 
07:50:19.510 --> 07:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
how that might be addressed
 
07:50:23.190 --> 07:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:24.830 --> 07:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
seeing no further
 
07:50:33.270 --> 07:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:33.280 --> 07:50:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
representative

07:50:35.030 --> 07:50:35.040 align:start position:0%

representative

07:50:36.548 --> 07:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
wheeler
 
07:50:48.230 --> 07:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:49.670 --> 07:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
07:50:54.388 --> 07:50:54.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:56.150 --> 07:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
the veterans tax credit originated in
 
07:50:57.590 --> 07:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
the civil war
 
07:50:59.190 --> 07:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
that's why the standard deduction is
 
07:51:00.468 --> 07:51:00.478 align:start position:0%
only 50
 
07:51:03.030 --> 07:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
in the late 1860s that was a substantial
 
07:51:04.628 --> 07:51:04.638 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
07:51:06.310 --> 07:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
substantial changes have been made to
 
07:51:08.230 --> 07:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
this deduction especially the definition
 
07:51:09.590 --> 07:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
of veteran
 
07:51:11.270 --> 07:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
this bill tries to clear up some of the
 
07:51:13.510 --> 07:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
confusion between sections and be more
 
07:51:13.520 --> 07:51:14.868 align:start position:0%
confusion between sections and be more
inclusive

07:51:14.868 --> 07:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
inclusive
 
07:51:16.628 --> 07:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
previous laws would only give deductions
 
07:51:17.990 --> 07:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
to those who actually were in the
 
07:51:19.750 --> 07:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
service in war times
 
07:51:21.350 --> 07:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
all who volunteer for service are at
 
07:51:23.590 --> 07:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
risk of being deployed at any time and
 
07:51:23.600 --> 07:51:24.708 align:start position:0%
risk of being deployed at any time and
anywhere

07:51:24.708 --> 07:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
07:51:26.948 --> 07:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
reservists and national guards are at
 
07:51:28.548 --> 07:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
people are at the same risk and should
 
07:51:30.388 --> 07:51:30.398 align:start position:0%
be treated similarly
 
07:51:32.070 --> 07:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
i'm a retired colonel with 30 years
 
07:51:34.788 --> 07:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
combined service and active in reserves
 
07:51:37.110 --> 07:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
yes officers are you note from the
 
07:51:39.190 --> 07:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
language treated a little differently
 
07:51:41.030 --> 07:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
when we leave a service we are
 
07:51:43.350 --> 07:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
considered subject to recall
 
07:51:45.590 --> 07:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
rather than being discharged
 
07:51:47.270 --> 07:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
and please pass this bill to clear up
 
07:51:49.750 --> 07:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
some inconsistencies i think it's a good
 
07:51:52.388 --> 07:51:52.398 align:start position:0%
change and i think it's well needed uh
 
07:51:55.110 --> 07:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
as far as the discharges
 
07:51:57.430 --> 07:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
in my reading of that section
 
07:51:59.350 --> 07:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
i think everything's covered but as you
 
07:52:01.350 --> 07:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
point out
 
07:52:03.110 --> 07:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
discharged with honor and just an
 
07:52:04.788 --> 07:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
honorable discharger not quite the same
 
07:52:07.430 --> 07:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
thing and i have a few friends that i've
 
07:52:09.030 --> 07:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
in several different veterans
 
07:52:11.110 --> 07:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
organizations and some would be like
 
07:52:13.750 --> 07:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
they're in basic training vietnam comes
 
07:52:15.510 --> 07:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
to an end
 
07:52:17.430 --> 07:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
you're discharged
 
07:52:19.190 --> 07:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
for honorable reasons or administrative
 
07:52:22.150 --> 07:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
reasons i've even seen those so this
 
07:52:23.270 --> 07:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
i couldn't believe the number of
 
07:52:25.110 --> 07:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
different reasons for discharges that i
 
07:52:27.190 --> 07:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
would hear from people but
 
07:52:28.468 --> 07:52:28.478 align:start position:0%
when they
 
07:52:31.030 --> 07:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
mailed in to try to get a veterans plate
 
07:52:33.110 --> 07:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes that would be a confusion
 
07:52:34.708 --> 07:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
through the years we've tried to
 
07:52:37.190 --> 07:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
straighten this out by rewriting it but
 
07:52:39.590 --> 07:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
if if you think it needs to be for
 
07:52:41.190 --> 07:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
honorable reasons or something like that
 
07:52:43.270 --> 07:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
then this would be a good time to put it
 
07:52:44.548 --> 07:52:44.558 align:start position:0%
in but
 
07:52:46.150 --> 07:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
i thought we had everything covered when
 
07:52:48.388 --> 07:52:48.398 align:start position:0%
i first read this bill but
 
07:52:49.990 --> 07:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
any that's that's why we come to a
 
07:52:52.868 --> 07:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
committee so our collective ideas can
 
07:52:55.030 --> 07:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
can come together and make sure we have
 
07:52:56.868 --> 07:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
have it as good as we hoped it would be
 
07:52:59.030 --> 07:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
and i i appreciate what representative
 
07:53:01.110 --> 07:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
power has done because this has been
 
07:53:03.110 --> 07:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
confused through the year it's like i
 
07:53:04.948 --> 07:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
remember i was here when we first tried
 
07:53:06.070 --> 07:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
to include
 
07:53:09.190 --> 07:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh people from afghanistan and iraq wars
 
07:53:10.868 --> 07:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
they weren't in here
 
07:53:12.150 --> 07:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
there would be a bunch of people that
 
07:53:13.910 --> 07:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
had been veterans and they'd go to get a
 
07:53:15.670 --> 07:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
they'd be discharged from service and
 
07:53:17.670 --> 07:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
they'd go to get things you're not
 
07:53:17.680 --> 07:53:19.190 align:start position:0%
they'd go to get things you're not
included

07:53:19.190 --> 07:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
included
 
07:53:21.110 --> 07:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's you got to wait till your
 
07:53:23.270 --> 07:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
war has been over for a few years then
 
07:53:24.948 --> 07:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
we stick it in the bill
 
07:53:27.030 --> 07:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
if somebody gets around to it
 
07:53:29.830 --> 07:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
but that's why you see so many different
 
07:53:32.468 --> 07:53:32.478 align:start position:0%
uh wars that are listed in some of the
 
07:53:35.430 --> 07:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
what what qualifies as a veteran so this
 
07:53:37.670 --> 07:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
okay you walk up you're on active duty
 
07:53:38.948 --> 07:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
you show
 
07:53:40.708 --> 07:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
an active duty
 
07:53:43.590 --> 07:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
id card that should be sufficient
 
07:53:43.600 --> 07:53:44.548 align:start position:0%
id card that should be sufficient
so

07:53:44.548 --> 07:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:53:45.990 --> 07:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
07:53:47.270 --> 07:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll get this thing all
 
07:53:48.788 --> 07:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
straightened out because
 
07:53:50.628 --> 07:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
there are some confusions in the town as
 
07:53:52.868 --> 07:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
was and one of the things listed in this
 
07:53:57.430 --> 07:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
2150 was a national guard uh id
 
07:53:59.830 --> 07:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
head down here ngb form 22 from the
 
07:54:01.190 --> 07:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
national guard
 
07:54:02.468 --> 07:54:02.478 align:start position:0%
under uh
 
07:54:05.190 --> 07:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
2150 so i guess there is a there is an
 
07:54:07.030 --> 07:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
intent to uh
 
07:54:09.670 --> 07:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
include national guardsmen
 
07:54:11.670 --> 07:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
and when they're the treatment for
 
07:54:13.110 --> 07:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
veterans so
 
07:54:13.120 --> 07:54:15.030 align:start position:0%
veterans so
representative

07:54:15.030 --> 07:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:54:16.868 --> 07:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
07:54:19.510 --> 07:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh
 
07:54:21.350 --> 07:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
earlier uh
 
07:54:24.548 --> 07:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
representative power was asked why there
 
07:54:28.070 --> 07:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
isn't a fiscal note attached to this
 
07:54:29.910 --> 07:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
since you're a finance guy
 
07:54:32.708 --> 07:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
i imagine that you would know
 
07:54:34.868 --> 07:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
whether it required a fiscal note or not
 
07:54:37.910 --> 07:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
since it's a town only expense well
 
07:54:39.590 --> 07:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
actually it's not a town only expense
 
07:54:41.350 --> 07:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
it's just a town only uh
 
07:54:43.030 --> 07:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
shift an expense
 
07:54:45.830 --> 07:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
would it need a fiscal note
 
07:54:47.430 --> 07:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
we have several different
 
07:54:50.388 --> 07:54:50.398 align:start position:0%
uh notes on it fn is a fiscal note which
 
07:54:52.070 --> 07:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
normally means it increases the state
 
07:54:54.388 --> 07:54:54.398 align:start position:0%
budget then there's an a which means
 
07:54:56.150 --> 07:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
that it requires an appropriation then
 
07:54:57.350 --> 07:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
there's an l
 
07:54:57.360 --> 07:54:58.310 align:start position:0%
there's an l
which

07:54:58.310 --> 07:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
which
 
07:55:01.030 --> 07:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
if you increase the budget locally this
 
07:55:03.030 --> 07:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
does not increase a budget
 
07:55:05.030 --> 07:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
it shifts some money
 
07:55:07.750 --> 07:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have the same criteria as
 
07:55:11.030 --> 07:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
f n or l f n l or a
 
07:55:12.788 --> 07:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
well thank you that's my epiphany for
 
07:55:14.628 --> 07:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
the day thank you
 
07:55:15.830 --> 07:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
very good
 
07:55:19.270 --> 07:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate it at least i know the answer
 
07:55:21.990 --> 07:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you colonel
 
07:55:25.030 --> 07:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
all right the next uh
 
07:55:26.868 --> 07:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
input we're going to get from is eric

07:56:15.510 --> 07:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
many
 
07:56:17.190 --> 07:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
americans are actually serving in the
 
07:56:18.948 --> 07:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
military including national guard and
 
07:56:18.958 --> 07:56:20.150 align:start position:0%
military including national guard and
reserve

07:56:20.150 --> 07:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
reserve
 
07:56:21.590 --> 07:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that number has been going down and
 
07:56:23.030 --> 07:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
down and down and right now we're at
 
07:56:25.110 --> 07:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
about half a percent of americans are
 
07:56:26.628 --> 07:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
actively serving
 
07:56:27.750 --> 07:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
so that kind of gives you a little bit
 
07:56:29.110 --> 07:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
of a metric of how much this would
 
07:56:31.350 --> 07:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
impact to include the
 
07:56:33.670 --> 07:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
currently serving members it's not going
 
07:56:35.670 --> 07:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
to be more than half a percent
 
07:56:38.388 --> 07:56:38.398 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire residents so that just
 
07:56:40.628 --> 07:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
to say so there's when you see a young
 
07:56:42.230 --> 07:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
person signing up today they are doing
 
07:56:44.150 --> 07:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
an honorable thing because it's there's
 
07:56:48.868 --> 07:56:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:50.310 --> 07:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
the representative here talked about a
 
07:56:52.868 --> 07:56:52.878 align:start position:0%
dd214 everybody thinks a dd214 is what
 
07:56:55.190 --> 07:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
you get when you retire but you can get
 
07:56:56.788 --> 07:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
it for a lot of reasons guardsmen and
 
07:56:58.070 --> 07:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
reservists can get it after they do a
 
07:57:00.788 --> 07:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
deployment so some towns may mistakenly
 
07:57:03.590 --> 07:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
be using that and they shouldn't be
 
07:57:05.430 --> 07:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
because the law is clear right now
 
07:57:06.948 --> 07:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
without this bill
 
07:57:08.628 --> 07:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
that you have to be separated in order
 
07:57:10.388 --> 07:57:10.398 align:start position:0%
to get the
 
07:57:12.388 --> 07:57:12.398 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credits
 
07:57:13.990 --> 07:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
which i think is wrong i'm here to
 
07:57:16.548 --> 07:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
support the bill
 
07:57:18.468 --> 07:57:18.478 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned i was in the air i was in
 
07:57:20.948 --> 07:57:20.958 align:start position:0%
the air national guard for my first 28
 
07:57:23.110 --> 07:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
years in the air force
 
07:57:23.120 --> 07:57:24.230 align:start position:0%
years in the air force
and

07:57:24.230 --> 07:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:57:26.628 --> 07:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
almost i think all of my time was done
 
07:57:28.868 --> 07:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
in title 32 status
 
07:57:28.878 --> 07:57:29.830 align:start position:0%
in title 32 status
so

07:57:29.830 --> 07:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:57:31.430 --> 07:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
when i went to get the veterans tax
 
07:57:34.548 --> 07:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
credit none of that time counted
 
07:57:36.548 --> 07:57:36.558 align:start position:0%
because it's title 32 and the law says
 
07:57:37.830 --> 07:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
title 10.
 
07:57:40.230 --> 07:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
i only got it because of my last two
 
07:57:43.190 --> 07:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
years in the air force reserve which is
 
07:57:45.110 --> 07:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
a title 10 status i'd be glad to answer
 
07:57:46.628 --> 07:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
any questions about titles if people
 
07:57:50.150 --> 07:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:51.670 --> 07:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
the other thing about
 
07:57:53.830 --> 07:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
people think that veterans are retired
 
07:57:56.548 --> 07:57:56.558 align:start position:0%
people that are on fixed incomes and
 
07:57:58.150 --> 07:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
have don't have a lot of financial means
 
07:57:59.590 --> 07:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
and certainly there are veterans in that
 
07:57:59.600 --> 07:58:00.788 align:start position:0%
and certainly there are veterans in that
category

07:58:00.788 --> 07:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
category
 
07:58:03.430 --> 07:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
but an active duty member who's serving
 
07:58:04.788 --> 07:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
if you've ever looked at military pay
 
07:58:06.708 --> 07:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
compared to civilian pay
 
07:58:08.468 --> 07:58:08.478 align:start position:0%
is a lot lower than what you get in the
 
07:58:10.948 --> 07:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
civilian sector military pay is less so
 
07:58:15.110 --> 07:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
to exclude currently serving veterans
 
07:58:17.110 --> 07:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
is probably the wrong thing because
 
07:58:18.708 --> 07:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
they're going to make more money when
 
07:58:19.830 --> 07:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
they get out of the military they're
 
07:58:21.430 --> 07:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
making a sacrifice when they're serving
 
07:58:22.788 --> 07:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
in more than one way including
 
07:58:22.798 --> 07:58:24.948 align:start position:0%
in more than one way including
financially

07:58:24.948 --> 07:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
financially
 
07:58:26.388 --> 07:58:26.398 align:start position:0%
so today
 
07:58:26.398 --> 07:58:27.590 align:start position:0%
so today
the

07:58:27.590 --> 07:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:58:29.030 --> 07:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
you know we have the so-called all
 
07:58:31.030 --> 07:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credit i would rather it
 
07:58:32.548 --> 07:58:32.558 align:start position:0%
should it's really more the some
 
07:58:34.070 --> 07:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credit because we're
 
07:58:36.150 --> 07:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
leaving out a lot of veterans especially
 
07:58:37.910 --> 07:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
when you look at the conflict between
 
07:58:40.310 --> 07:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
how we define it in 2150
 
07:58:47.430 --> 07:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:50.628 --> 07:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
the ngb form 22 should be counted and it
 
07:58:53.190 --> 07:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
does count it recognizes it but when you
 
07:58:55.750 --> 07:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
do guards duty unless you're doing
 
07:58:58.230 --> 07:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
overseas war duty all that duties is
 
07:58:59.990 --> 07:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
title 32
 
07:59:01.510 --> 07:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
which i think is a good
 
07:59:04.388 --> 07:59:04.398 align:start position:0%
uh piece another another bit
 
07:59:06.788 --> 07:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
that i would bring forward is that in my
 
07:59:08.150 --> 07:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
last job in the air force reserve i
 
07:59:10.230 --> 07:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
serve with all services including the
 
07:59:11.750 --> 07:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
coast guard
 
07:59:14.230 --> 07:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
and uh the coast guard
 
07:59:16.150 --> 07:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
actually serves in another title title
 
07:59:18.388 --> 07:59:18.398 align:start position:0%
14. so you're actually taking care of
 
07:59:20.708 --> 07:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
our coast guardsmen by deleting title 10
 
07:59:24.310 --> 07:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
so you're letting title 32 title 14 and
 
07:59:27.030 --> 07:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
title 10 all count to qualify as it
 
07:59:27.040 --> 07:59:27.910 align:start position:0%
title 10 all count to qualify as it
should

07:59:27.910 --> 07:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
should
 
07:59:29.990 --> 07:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
so i think that's an important fix in
 
07:59:31.510 --> 07:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
the law
 
07:59:33.110 --> 07:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
07:59:34.388 --> 07:59:34.398 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned
 
07:59:36.310 --> 07:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
officers that get out i can still be
 
07:59:39.190 --> 07:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
recalled i'm in the retired reserve so
 
07:59:41.590 --> 07:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
i had to wait until i was done my 30
 
07:59:43.750 --> 07:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
years until i could actually apply for
 
07:59:45.430 --> 07:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
the veterans tax credit and finally get
 
07:59:47.830 --> 07:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
it just a couple of years ago finally
 
07:59:50.070 --> 07:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
so i think we need to do the right thing
 
07:59:51.990 --> 07:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
and take care of our
 
07:59:53.670 --> 07:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
servicemen and women who are currently
 
07:59:55.190 --> 07:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
serving have been in more than four
 
07:59:57.830 --> 07:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
years and and passed this bill to take
 
08:00:00.310 --> 08:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
care of all veterans in new hampshire
 
08:00:01.750 --> 08:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
08:00:04.150 --> 08:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
08:00:07.110 --> 08:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
you mentioned something that kind of
 
08:00:09.590 --> 08:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
reminded me of something when i was
 
08:00:11.110 --> 08:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
in service
 
08:00:13.750 --> 08:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
back in 78
 
08:00:16.388 --> 08:00:16.398 align:start position:0%
79 time frame
 
08:00:18.948 --> 08:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
i had troops that were
 
08:00:21.590 --> 08:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
on food stamps that's how that's how
 
08:00:24.070 --> 08:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
poorly we were paying them
 
08:00:24.080 --> 08:00:24.948 align:start position:0%
poorly we were paying them
and

08:00:24.948 --> 08:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:00:27.270 --> 08:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
it was a real real crime to see that
 
08:00:28.788 --> 08:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
going on
 
08:00:31.350 --> 08:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your testimony okay uh
 
08:00:39.670 --> 08:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:41.670 --> 08:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have jim misho here
 
08:00:44.310 --> 08:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
all right so that's going to conclude
 
08:00:47.350 --> 08:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
mr chairman was that 1978
 
08:00:47.360 --> 08:00:50.468 align:start position:0%
mr chairman was that 1978
yes

08:00:50.468 --> 08:00:50.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:53.430 --> 08:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:57.590 --> 08:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
lucky i didn't say it yeah
 
08:00:59.190 --> 08:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
okay so uh
 
08:01:01.030 --> 08:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
i want to
 
08:01:04.388 --> 08:01:04.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:06.788 --> 08:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
and i want to congratulate my committee
 
08:01:10.070 --> 08:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
members who have now finished work on
 
08:01:11.910 --> 08:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
all your spills
 
08:01:13.830 --> 08:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's done
 
08:01:15.990 --> 08:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
so uh we're going to be going into
 
08:01:18.230 --> 08:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
executive session next week
 
08:01:19.670 --> 08:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
and we're going to we're going to work
 
08:01:20.868 --> 08:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
it hard
 
08:01:23.510 --> 08:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking at up to a
 
08:01:27.590 --> 08:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
dozen 15 bills a day
 
08:01:30.388 --> 08:01:30.398 align:start position:0%
but this should go pretty fast
 
08:01:32.070 --> 08:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else have any questions
 
08:01:34.788 --> 08:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
before we adjourn
 
08:01:36.788 --> 08:01:36.798 align:start position:0%
okay we are adjourned
 
08:02:24.070 --> 08:02:24.080 align:start position:0%

you
