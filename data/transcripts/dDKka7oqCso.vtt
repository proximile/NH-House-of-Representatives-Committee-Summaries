revenues

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
start by introducing morning my name is

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
Administration all right um today we
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
will be discussing the uh the impact of
 
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
the credit carryovers um I believe uh
 
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
all of your members have a copy of the
 
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
calculations that we prepared uh that
 
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
was sent over to uh J uh I believe that
 
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
was last week so here in front of you is
 
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
the uh the our estimate of what in terms
 
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 align:start position:0%
of excuse me terms of the fiscal impact
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
of the uh the law change that requires
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
the uh the refund of any excess of five
 
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
500% of the uh liability or 250% % or
 
00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
100 or 100% depending on the tax year
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
end uh of the credit carryovers so uh
 
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
for taxable year taxable period ending
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
2022 is when it starts uh with the 500%
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh anything in excess of 5% will be
 
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
refunded uh and then with tax year 2025
 
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
it goes down to 250% and then with uh
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
tax year
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
2027 uh taxable perers ending 2027 it'll
 
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
be 100% of the excess will be refunded
 
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:31.879 align:start position:0%
back to the taxpayers our calculation is
 
00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
based on using the tax year 2021 tax
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
return data uh that would be um the
 
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
latest um tax year uh that we would have
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
full data um because of the the the
 
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
timing of when returns majority of the
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
calendar file the returns when they file
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
their returns um and they will go on
 
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
extensions and potentially the the bulk
 
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
of the returns calendar your files would
 
00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
likely file at the end end of the next
 
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
year so text your 21 returns calendar
 
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
year files they will file on they
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
following deadlines April 15 of
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
22 but then um nor normally they will
 
00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
get an they will file an extension and
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
file on November 15 of 22 so um so Tex
 
00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:22.599 align:start position:0%
21 data would be the most complete year
 
00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
um of text us data and based on this
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
we've uh our we made our calculations
 
00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:36.039 align:start position:0%
by delineating the 500% to 50% and 100%
 
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
And as an total as a sum the uh amount
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
of expected carry uh expected refund
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
would be uh or the amount of the fiscal
 
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
impact of that uh of those laws will be
 
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.430 align:start position:0%
impact of that uh of those laws will be
$38.8

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
$38.8
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
million uh with 36.5 million being from
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
the 500% the 500% uh cut off and then
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
35.9% % from the uh the 250% cut off
 
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
after taking off the 500% and then the
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
66.4% being at the 100% cut off um after
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
taking the other previous uh cut
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
offs um so the table below shows um what
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
we would expect in terms of a range of
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact for the following
 
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal years from 2023 to 2030 uh from a
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
low let's say if the the the ways where
 
00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayers might might if they have a
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
overpayment how would
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
they um how would they react to that
 
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
overpayment they could either request
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
for refund or they could either uh
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
adjust their poten their future
 
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
estimated tax payments and utilize that
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
overpayment in future returns So based
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
on those data sets we've come up with an
 
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
estimate of in terms of a range for each
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year uh between a low and a high
 
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
impact um for for each of the fiscal
 
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
years for those scenarios and um so
 
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
that's what you see in the uh the table
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
below now
 
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
um uh Senator Langs so when you're
 
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the table below right so
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
again we're dealing with the fact that
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have a a carryover on the
 
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
books um and we have a new law that'll
 
00:10:31.949 --> 00:10:31.959 align:start position:0%
slowly draw down that tax impact so we
 
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
don't keep carrying a liability on the
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
state side um and give that back to the
 
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
business owner or a taxpayer my question
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
when I'm looking at the 2 million to 23
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
million is that so I'm assuming you're
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
talking about 2 million to $23 million
 
00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
refund or application to a future
 
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
liability that they don't send cash in
 
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be one of those two
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
choices correct that's correct and so we
 
00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
so you're if I look at this to 2 to 23
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
million so that means that we're going
 
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
to to see a negative um impact on state
 
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
revenues to the tune of 2 million to 23
 
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
million for 2023 either because of the
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
one of those two cases they took the
 
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
refund in whole or they applied it to
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
their liability for that year and we
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
didn't see any new money coming in we're
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
using old money to pay for new taxes
 
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.230 align:start position:0%
using old money to pay for new taxes
that's

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
so what's happening in
 
00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:36.590 align:start position:0%
so what's happening in
2030

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
2030
 
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
2030 um it goes down
 
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.550 align:start position:0%
2030 um it goes down
to

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
zero that's correct so we get to that
 
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
100% in tax year 27 so at that point
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing on that um tax
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
expenditure impact would just be uh late
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
filers from tax year
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
27 um finally filing the return turns
 
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
either taking a refund or using it for
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
their tax year
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
28 well actually at that point they have
 
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
100% uh yeah Senator l so can you remind
 
00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
me the years these these these 100% 250
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
500 go into effect sure so the 500% went
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
into effect for tax years ending
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
December 31st 22 the 250 would tax years
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
ending December 31st 2025 and the 100%
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
you just just looking at this chart it's
 
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
it's interesting because when we look at
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
2023 to 2025 it's it's heading down now
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
that cut off being 22 then when we get
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
to the cut off or in 2025 when it's down
 
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.389 align:start position:0%
to the cut off or in 2025 when it's down
to

00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:10.839 align:start position:0%
the oh I see 2025 CH back up because it
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
has to do with the timing of how they
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
file the returns so we went start seeing
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
any impact until 26 and and a small
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
impact at that at the 250% but it really
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
ramps up but then at the same time that
 
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
100% kicks in one year earlier so then
 
00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:29.079 align:start position:0%
you see it kind of balloon when you have
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
the 100 and the 250 both at the same
 
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
time fiscal 20 I think it's fiscal 207
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
28 really
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
29 yeah because that that's what I I
 
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959 align:start position:0%
think impacted me seeing in 29 such a
 
00:13:43.959 --> 00:13:48.310 align:start position:0%
think impacted me seeing in 29 such a
huge

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.749 --> 00:13:50.759 align:start position:0%
increase when I I guess what I'm a
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
little cons confused about is we had a
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
250% difference from 22 to
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
25 um
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
150% difference between 25 and
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
27 but yet and and doesn't doesn't this
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
resolve itself over the course of one
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
year I mean in one year they have to be
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
made whole as to the to the law so I
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
guess I'm I still don't understand how
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
in 2029 it jumps to
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
61 sure so there's two things happening
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
um so in our write up in the middle area
 
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
the um the amount of liability at the
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
100% is nearly double of the liability
 
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
250% so um on the tax year 21 example
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
that we're using of that um what was it
 
00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:44.759 align:start position:0%
138.0 million 66.4 of that is at the
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
100% so that's at the back end where
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
it's only
 
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
35.9 at the 250% so that's why you might
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
see that Whittle down and then the 100
 
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
just comes in very strong because
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
there's just so much more to either to
 
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
be refunded
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
and that's also has a little bit of that
 
00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:04.759 align:start position:0%
assumption too that if you can leave the
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
full amount of liability that you will
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
so that's why we also have that range
 
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
because people may just leave 100% now
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
and they've already fully
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
conformed okay so I think what you're
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
saying the the it's shaped like a
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
pyramid right with that 500% being the
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
top half of the pyramid not M taxpayers
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
fall into that there are a few but and
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
it may be a significant amount but as
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
you start moving down the two 50 it gets
 
00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:30.519 align:start position:0%
broader when you get all the way down to
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
the 100 that's a really broad base lots
 
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:35.319 align:start position:0%
of taxpayers carrying slightly over 100
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
but less than 250 right exactly like we
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
noticed at the beginning of this um
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
seeing the refunds go out those who were
 
00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
hitting the 500% were our smaller
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
taxpayers because it's just very easy to
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
hit that 500% Mark if you owe $100 in
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
tax okay and the return the the refund
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
if we will on this or the or the
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
carryover is only anything that's a
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
above that Mark correct correct right so
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
we'll maintain going forward 100% right
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
you can carry 100% credit carry over
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
every year going forward once we gets
 
00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:10.759 align:start position:0%
fully matured but if you at 110% you're
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
going to get a refund for that 10%
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
you and then if if we had projected uh
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
30 31 uh 20 31 32 33 we don't we expect
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
that to pretty much be zero to 1.5
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
million I mean I realize it's going to
 
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:31.240 align:start position:0%
change but in that lower yeah area
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
um dick anything
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
else no I guess the picture is that um
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
we're going through a
 
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
transition which is costly overall to
 
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.470 align:start position:0%
transition which is costly overall to
our

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
Revenue um but then we'll get to the
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
other side of it and um Life Will Go On
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
as they'll pay their liabilities
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
and yeah I I believe the the initial
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
concern I believe the initial concern
 
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
from the legislators was that we were
 
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
keeping a a large balance on the books
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
and this was a tool to minimize that or
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
mitigate that
 
00:17:12.439 --> 00:17:14.309 align:start position:0%
mitigate that
situation

00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
right so is it fair to say we think that
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
that um idea that the legislature had is
 
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
working out uh that we're resolving uh
 
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.510 align:start position:0%
working out uh that we're resolving uh
potential

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
um sudden Demand on our treasury I think
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
I think we're seeing that starting to
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
happen with the refunds um so I guess
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
yeah it's we're starting to see that
 
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
ramp up particularly in this past month
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
and we'll see it more as on the
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
extensions come uh the Returns on
 
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
extension come in on the calendar filers
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
and we do have um fiscal filers too so
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
we'll see some of that impact later in
 
00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
the year when they come off of extend
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
ition and file the return and as we look
 
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
at your reports we see that in the
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
refund column is that correct because
 
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
those numbers have been up a little bit
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
I think right now um year to date
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
through last week when um that those
 
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
refunds went out about 30 we identified
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
about 30% of the refunds were related to
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
um the taxpayer hitting the CCO C and
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
some of them opted to keep 500% and
 
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
others um a lot more of them are
 
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 100 and 500 they're
 
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
not just because they can they
 
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:43.029 align:start position:0%
not just because they can they
necessarily

00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
you okay um next next we're we will hear
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
questions you
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
have the uh $5 million cap um first of
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
all thank you for coming today and
 
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
speaking uh the $5 million cap um is
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
that per organization or is that total
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide total
 
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.909 align:start position:0%
Statewide total

00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
okay so the $5 million cap that's the
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
amount of the credit not the amount you
 
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
can collect right because you only give
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
75 if I remember right 75% of the
 
00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
donation turns into a tax credit so you
 
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
get you're collecting
 
00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
6.25 potential total donations but it
 
00:26:59.470 --> 00:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
equals $5 million in tax credit it's
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
actually we collect $5 million and it
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
equals U $3.75 million in tax credit so
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
the maximum liability on the state side
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and currently how close are you
 
00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:20.919 align:start position:0%
sorry if I go ahead so can you talk to
 
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
me about how close you are do you get
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
you hit the $5 million cap every year in
 
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
donations single year yep for a decade
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
and and so every year the state seeing
 
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
roughly a
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
3.75 uh four or five million private
 
00:27:35.389 --> 00:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
investment we're giving away 3.75
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
million dollars in tax credits to help
 
00:27:41.789 --> 00:27:41.799 align:start position:0%
the local communities cor and often um
 
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
it's interesting the range of other
 
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
funds that the projects bring to bear
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
for these projects we can be as little
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
as 5% of the projects sometimes even
 
00:27:51.549 --> 00:27:51.559 align:start position:0%
smaller amounts but depending on the
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
financial complexity of the project or
 
00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
higher amounts if it's a smaller project
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
um but they're always always bringing
 
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
additional funds into the project so for
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
that $5 million it's leveraging millions
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
of additional investment as well
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
right thank you um I have a question so
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
the boys and girls club for ex for
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
example um that's a nonprofit correct
 
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
yes um and are they actually I guess
 
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
what I'm wondering is are they actually
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
making money to be able to have a tax
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
credit against oh yeah so they receive
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
an allocation of the tax credits and
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
they find businesses who are committed
 
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
to that project in Penacook there were a
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
number of businesses that have been
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
really challenged their employees were
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
challenged for many years for child care
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
and so the businesses really care about
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
that project that was is being built
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
right now actually in Penacook and so
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
they actually make a commitment of a
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
donation to the project and the business
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
receives the tax credit oh I see okay
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
and then the the nonprofit receives the
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
tax credit Equity to invest in the
 
00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
construction I see
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great project right across
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
from a a city-owned park and then the
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
city's committed to creating um a
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
Auxiliary Library so the city of
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
conquered has a small Branch that's
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
actually going to be attached to the
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
Boys and Girls Club um really making it
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
a viable Community Center
 
00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:19.710 align:start position:0%
a viable Community Center
there

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
B I think that one of your projects is
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
the Park Theater and uh in Jeffrey it is
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
yeah been a great success so my question
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
is actually the other side of that uh
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
what about failures do you have uh some
 
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
projects that just don't make it I can't
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
think of one wow um projects do
 
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes need flexibility and that's
 
00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
one of the wonderful things about this
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
program so for instance a project can
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
hit environmental issues that they
 
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
didn't expect and so one of the sort of
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
really critical things is that we hold
 
00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
the resources and provide technical
 
00:29:59.549 --> 00:29:59.559 align:start position:0%
assistance throughout the period of
 
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:01.519 align:start position:0%
Development and Construction and can
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
really help to resolve any of those
 
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
challenges and have the flexibility to
 
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
for instance give more time if that's
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
necessary to complete the project
 
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
successfully but we've not had a failure
 
00:30:12.669 --> 00:30:12.679 align:start position:0%
so we did have one project that had to
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
pay the resources back but the nice
 
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
thing was because of the lean and the
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
ability to recapture those resources
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
they were invested right back in the
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
community okay
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
um do you have direct staff a
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
significant staff directly on board to
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
do this this work uh we have two members
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
of our staff that are direct on this
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
program but all of our 14 staff um who
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
run other programs Community Development
 
00:30:38.909 --> 00:30:38.919 align:start position:0%
programs really participate in the
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
Outreach and providing that technical
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
assistance I think that's one of the
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
nice things is that we can kind we can
 
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
really um have a lot of expertise on our
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
staff and bring them to Bear where
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
they're needed on the projects depending
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
on the challenges or the or what other
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh technical assistance they need to be
 
00:30:59.310 --> 00:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
successful good thank
 
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
you how how is the
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
cdfa funded we receive administra fees
 
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
for um administering the programs that
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
we do so we also in addition to the tax
 
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
credit credit for the state we
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
administer the Community Development
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
block grant so that's a program from HUD
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
and we also administer some private
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
funds as well all related to community
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
Economic Development so the state of New
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not funding it there's a
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
very small commitment that needs to be
 
00:31:27.629 --> 00:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
made by the state in order for the
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
Community Development block grant to
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
come um and so we do receive that
 
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
thankfully from the state each
 
00:31:39.789 --> 00:31:39.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
$197,000 and that um and the annual
 
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
Award of that Housing and Urban
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
Development Community Development block
 
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
grants is a little um a little more than
 
00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.430 align:start position:0%
grants is a little um a little more than
$9

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
$9
 
00:31:51.789 --> 00:31:51.799 align:start position:0%
million and the private donations are
 
00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:54.919 align:start position:0%
those from businesses and individuals
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
businesses businesses okay no no
 
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.629 --> 00:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
we're just hey thank you and and I I get
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
the impression that um you think you're
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
running a very successful program that's
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
needed yes it's the projects really
 
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
speak I think to the success so the the
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
public private Partnerships that created
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
by the businesses and the nonprofits is
 
00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
really I think demonstrated in every
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
project one of the things that we really
 
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
um are always excited about is the
 
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
lasting partnership that's created so
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
the tax credit may be the thing the
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle that brings that partnership
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
together but often the businesses
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
participate with the project years in
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
after our investment so they're sitting
 
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
on the boards of these nonprofits or
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
they're providing um uh in service um
 
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
cleanup days or working with uh the
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
youth in the youth program so I think
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
that the state is really stimulating
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
that public private partnership that's
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
beyond the investment of the tax credit
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
but that's really what kicks it off
 
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
that's a good concept we're certainly
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
seeing that with the Park Theater and uh
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
the continued engagement of local
 
00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
businesses in in the work that's
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
great Senator Lang recommendations do
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
you have is there anything in the law
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
that getting in your way to doing more
 
00:33:30.629 --> 00:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
doing better doing is there any
 
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations you would have for this
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
committee to how we might adopt a change
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
to this program to help you better thank
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
you so much um I think the program is
 
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
very flexible and I and we really
 
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate the way that the legislation
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
was written which really focuses on that
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
public benefit and ensuring that there's
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh economic outputs I think the only
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
change would be just an increase to the
 
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
tax credit allocation because there's
 
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
such a significant demand and there
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
really is that economic benefit seen by
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
the investment we would recommend an
 
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
increase if that was at all
 
00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
possible so again so that $5 million cap
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about potentially moving
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
that up so that you could broaden the
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
the programs yeah we have demand for
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
that year after year and because it
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
really results in that Economic
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
Development we would ask that the
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
legislature consider along its other
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
priorities and uh increase to that $5
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
million cap do you have a suggested
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
amount within
 
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:29.510 align:start position:0%
amount within
reason

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh based on I mean based on how many
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
people you're seeing applying the the
 
00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
value you think those projects would
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
would help the
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
community I think there could be two
 
00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
ways of looking at it one of the ways
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
that we had thought of was actually to
 
00:34:45.629 --> 00:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
increase the the cost to the state to
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
the five million so instead of the 5
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
million of allocation which results in
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
3.75 I think there's always sort of an
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
understanding that it actually cost the
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
five million so if you increased it two
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
of $5
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
million um of tax credit that we could
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
give out then that would be an
 
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
allocation of I I think it's 7.2 or so I
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
think that's a little less than the
 
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
demand we actually see so if it was
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
possible we would really in we would
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
really see a demand for more like $1
 
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
million of allocation of tax credit
 
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:20.599 align:start position:0%
resulting in approximately 8.5 of cost
 
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
state sure so just to make sure I
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
understand what you're asking for is the
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
is have the $5 million reference the tax
 
00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
credit side yeah and then whatever
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
revenue on the other side you need to
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
you can get for donations equal the $5
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
million in tax credits that's what
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
you're looking for I think that would be
 
00:35:38.589 --> 00:35:38.599 align:start position:0%
the minimum I request and then the
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
maximum if it was feasible would be $10
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
million uh reference for tax credit
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
allocation but I think that would that
 
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
would be a significant increase and and
 
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
really allow us to make a number of
 
00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.630 align:start position:0%
really allow us to make a number of
additional

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:51.640 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
Investments yes repres do you have an
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make requests like the
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
budget request Quest like this during
 
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
the budget process the state's budget
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
process are you asked this question we
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
have Ways and Means well I guess we're
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
all ways and means but you're something
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
else in the Senate aren you two things
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
come on
 
00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
man U anyway
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
uh we're not fi the finance committee we
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
don't do the budget um and uh so I don't
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
know whether there's some place in that
 
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
process that cdfa has an opportunity to
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
make a request not directly because the
 
00:36:36.309 --> 00:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
because it's part of statue it doesn't
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
come up as part of the budget process um
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
we had there was interest in considering
 
00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:45.319 align:start position:0%
an increase and um probably two years
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
ago that was really thought of um but we
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
were administering an additional 14
 
00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
million to for uh coid related uh needs
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
at that time it was the Community
 
00:36:58.829 --> 00:36:58.839 align:start position:0%
Development block rants coid funds and
 
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
so there was just a little less uh sort
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
of time to be able to really provide the
 
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
materials and the information to request
 
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
that it would need to come though from
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
um a legisl a legislative yet an LSR
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
it's not something that we can that we
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
can um request okay well it's good to
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
have this information yeah thank you for
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
having me makes sense okay thank you
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
next we're going to talk about the
 
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
economic revitalization zone tax credit
 
00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
and the Coos County job creation tax
 
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
credit good morning my name is Chase
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
Hegman I'm the new director of economic
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
development at business and economic
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
Affairs I recently jumped into this role
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
so my first time before the committee
 
00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
excited to be here and I'm joined by
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
brid sorry Bridget Beck I managed the
 
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
program welcome so Bridget's our uh
 
00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
program manager and and expert on these
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
um particular issues but I thought it
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to kind of give an
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
overview of the programs and where they
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
are um as of this last tax year and then
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
um answer any questions you might have
 
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
either along the way or at the end so
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
starting with the um economic
 
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
revitalization zone tax credit program
 
00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:27.319 align:start position:0%
it's established oh I'm sorry you also
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
have a handout and that's largely what
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
I'll be referencing as we go through oh
 
00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.069 align:start position:0%
I'll be referencing as we go through oh
this

00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
one it's um yeah it's a few pages just
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
on the uh programs
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
themselves so the erz um tax credit
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
program is established by RSA 162 in uh
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
it's a short-term business tax credit um
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
program that focuses on projects that
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
help improve infrastructure create jobs
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
and designated areas of municipalities
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
across the state the state designates
 
00:38:54.839 --> 00:38:56.630 align:start position:0%
across the state the state designates
$825,000

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
$825,000
 
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
a year in available tax credits there
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
are currently 227 zones across 77
 
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and uh the program has
 
00:39:10.309 --> 00:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
been over subscribed I think 2014 2011
 
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
2011 sorry uh the tax credits can be
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
applied against the business profits tax
 
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
and anything uh remaining can then be
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
applied to um a business's uh business
 
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax the every every cycle the
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
maximum credit that can be um awarded is
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
$240,000 with a maximum of $40,000 that
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
can be applied each year to that
 
00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.030 align:start position:0%
can be applied each year to that
company's

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
taxes the calculation itself is a
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
two-part calculation one uh aspect of it
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
focuses on the uh wage level of new um
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
full-time positions and the other uh is
 
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
an either or um part of the equation
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
where um the percentage of costs
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
incurred for infrastructure rure
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
investment or certain expenditures or a
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
certain dollar figure based on new job a
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
new job that was created in that
 
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
calendar year and then both of those
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
parts are added together and it results
 
00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
in the total amount that they can be
 
00:40:13.309 --> 00:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
awarded and because the program is over
 
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
subscribed there is a prata of
 
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
percentage that's applied so that
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
applicants although may be eligible for
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
a larger amount are actually awarded
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
less because so many are interested in
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
the program and are eligible for it so
 
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
this last last uh tax year or calendar
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
year a prata of 37% was applied for
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
eligible applicants um $2.2 million in
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
credits were deemed available uh or
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
eligible and $825,000 on worth of
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
credits awarded based on that pretta
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
that reflects actually about $192
 
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:51.640 align:start position:0%
million in uh in investments in the
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
local economy and projects and 858 jobs
 
00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh there's actually um uh it's it was a
 
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
really interesting data point that I
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to throw in here um for this last
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
tax year 94% of the jobs that were
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
hour yeah and that's the uh erz program
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
as of right now the Coos County job
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
creation tax credit ohop sorry go ahead
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
um let's just um jump in there look at
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh this one that you just talked about
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
first um the um okay yeah the $18 an
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
hour I just I was looking to see where
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
that was okay you do have that on this
 
00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.870 align:start position:0%
that was okay you do have that on this
sheet

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
um any questions on what's been
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
presented so far yes representative Ames
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
I was
 
00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
wondering the
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
um 2022 you get up to uh you jump up to
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
pretty far above it certainly far more
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
than twice or almost Thrice the uh
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
previous year so what's going on there
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
um so I would I would as a person
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
processing these say that we had some
 
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
larger investments in
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
2022 postco so the 2020 and the 2021
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
directly would relate to coid um and
 
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
what was going on and and the reduction
 
00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:28.559 align:start position:0%
in growth at that time and a big gear up
 
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
and then you see the the Giant and there
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
was a couple big hitters we had two uh
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
that qualified for the max credit and
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
they had a lot of investment so that's
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
pretty much where that figure comes
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
from yes Senator I'm gonna be real
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
ignorant here explain to me what an
 
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
investment means is that like a business
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
that's going to build a new building and
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
create some new jobs and there and
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
they're in the economic zone so
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
therefore they can apply to the state
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
for the differential for the new jobs
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
they're creating based on this
 
00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
investment they're making in a new
 
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
correct just take a moment and look at
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
sure I'm sorry and we're cap that no
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
matter what it is it's $825,000 right
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
now that's the maximum dispersement we
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
can give that is correct and so we total
 
00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:22.359 align:start position:0%
up how many new jobs for Lac of phrase
 
00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
are created within a given economic zone
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
and then B based on where they fall
 
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:29.720 align:start position:0%
within that pro-rated scale are a one
 
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
times minimum wage two times three times
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
whatever that number is um you give a
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
different ratio back to them for um as a
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
credit and that tax credit's taken off
 
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax business
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax where does it go both
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
both so it starts with the BPT and rolls
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
into the bet if there's additional if
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
there's funds remaining on the credit
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
are they if there's additional so it's
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
not a double correct double hit
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:59.510 align:start position:0%
not a double correct double hit
correct

00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.829 --> 00:44:02.839 align:start position:0%
so and um this is sounds like it's
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
proven to be extremely effective given
 
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
you have more applying than you have
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
total credits
 
00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
for yeah I I would say and Bridget can
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
certainly jump in on this um given the
 
00:44:15.549 --> 00:44:15.559 align:start position:0%
fact that we have ongoing increasing
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
demand in this program it's regularly
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
oversubscribed um it's certainly doing
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
what it was designed to do um in statute
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
initially um if you ask us if we have
 
00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
any recommendations I would say we'll
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
follow up with you because now that I'm
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
in this role we're reviewing the program
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
to see if there might be any
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations we have as a result of
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing in it I one more data
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
request and well just along those lines
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
um we have to get a report in by
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
November 1st so um the sooner you can
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
quick about it that sounds great just a
 
00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
one data request would it be possible to
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
get an overlay on the state right a map
 
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
and just kind of show a keep map of
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
where these Investments are being made
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
made yeah yeah
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely we do sorry we do have a list
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
of the actual eres if you would like to
 
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
have that um but I understand you're
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
asking for where the projects are
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
effectively yeah basically I want to see
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
geographically where the where we're
 
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
investing this money and what it looks
 
00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
like I mean the next one's pretty easy
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
Coos County I pretty much know where
 
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
that's going it's all right there but
 
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
this one I'd kind of like to see what
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
the dispersement looks like around the
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
state likewise the erz as you mentioned
 
00:45:26.549 --> 00:45:26.559 align:start position:0%
you had a little
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
those I'm sorry what was that the erz is
 
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
that uh the list that oh we have that
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
for you yeah right oh you got it right
 
00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
there would you like the list today of
 
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
sure I'll do it you it
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
okay and then I I guess what I'd ask
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
when you do that that heat map maybe you
 
00:45:54.549 --> 00:45:54.559 align:start position:0%
can do a second just also overlay the
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
Coos County so we can see how these two
 
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
interact with each otheres that make
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
sense so the heat map will contain both
 
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
the erz credit as well as the Coos
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
County Credit maybe in different colors
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
so we can see where the map looks oh
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely sure may I ask a clarifying
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
question if we don't have the actual
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
ability to make a map would a a a
 
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
listing of of locations suffice sure I
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
can create a map out of that so we can
 
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
probably do it I just want to make
 
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
sure show you a piece of software that
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:29.470 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
okay I guess um at this point we can
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
County uh the Coos County job creation
 
00:46:41.309 --> 00:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
tax credit under RSA 77e and
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
162q um provides qualifying companies
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
with a tax credit for every new
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
full-time yearround employee hired in
 
00:46:50.589 --> 00:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
Coos County it can be renewed for the
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
credit itself can be renewed for up to
 
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
five consecutive tax periods if the
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
employee that was hired remains um with
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
the employer there's no limit on this
 
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
program uh like the um erz so there's
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
not a Set Max on how much can go out in
 
00:47:08.349 --> 00:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
terms of tax credits but uh there
 
00:47:10.549 --> 00:47:10.559 align:start position:0%
although there has been um increasing
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
Demand on the program over the last
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
several years it seems to be hovering
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
between 187,000 and
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
$225,000 a year uh in terms of credits
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
that are going out the door to qualify
 
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
there are two levels of tax credit in
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
the program one is $750 one is
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
$1,000 um per qualified worker and
 
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
that's based off where their wage Falls
 
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
relative to the um State minimum wage so
 
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
you get a $750 tax credit if you um hire
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
someone um equal to or greater uh than
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
150% of the current state minimum wage
 
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh then you get $1,000 credit if it's
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
200% or greater of the state minimum
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
wage in 2022 uh credits totaling
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
$222,200 we approved representing 225
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
jobs and 39 businesses in Coos County
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
across service retail manufacturing uh
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
and Professional Service sectors that uh
 
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
reflects a breakdown of 78 new positions
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
and 147 that were retained or renewed
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
based on that ongoing fiveyear
 
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
period anything else you want to add
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
Bridget uh just much like the other
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
program as we can see the the 92%
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
they're paying a higher wage up there so
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
end so there's no no cap on this as you
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned so this is something that I
 
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
guess we just have to it looks like it's
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
fairly constrained um so there's no need
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
to take any action unless this suddenly
 
00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
jumps uh out of control but right now it
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
seems fairly
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
stable so again I understand it this
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
$750 per newe job
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
is the credit that the business would
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
receive again bet BBT um application and
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to renew a new job up to
 
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
five years so if I create a from in job
 
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
in year one um then I get one credit if
 
00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
I create another new job I get a credit
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
for the first job and the second job and
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
and it it Cascades down up to five years
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
and at the end of five years that first
 
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
one will fall off and they're back to
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
just whatever new job they create asked
 
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
correct repr aims so I guess the theory
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
the idea is that
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
um that with this tax credit will
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
enable companies to
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
employ a person or persons where they
 
00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.349 align:start position:0%
employ a person or persons where they
wouldn't

00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise have been able to do that it's
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's sort of that additional boost the
 
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
ideas um that this uh program provides
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
do you have any way of testing whether
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
or worst case companies are just getting
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
$1,000 or whatever it is um and um
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
that's nice but they would have done it
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
anyway I think that's a difficult
 
00:50:14.789 --> 00:50:14.799 align:start position:0%
question to answer actually um and I'm
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
not even sure they could answer that um
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sure they all do appreciate
 
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
getting the credit and I'm sure they're
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
reinvesting it back into the business
 
00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.870 align:start position:0%
reinvesting it back into the business
but

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
um whether they would have hired if this
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
credit had hadn't been there it would be
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
really hard to get that answer I think I
 
00:50:34.589 --> 00:50:34.599 align:start position:0%
bet it's a good question I agree I don't
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
I don't to to answer it directly I don't
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
think we have a specific data point on
 
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
whether they would or would not have
 
00:50:40.589 --> 00:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
done something based on the credit but
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
it's certainly incentivizing the
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
behavior that is desired by the statute
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
you know hiring and retaining a
 
00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce in in a very rural County um
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
where that Workforce is needed yeah
 
00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.430 align:start position:0%
where that Workforce is needed yeah
thank

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
you I'd have to agree I'm looking at
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
just your numbers again it looks like
 
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
the North country is seeing a little bit
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
of job growth at least relative to the
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
tax credit so which is what the intended
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
I think the intended purpose of the
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
credit was to begin with was to help the
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.069 --> 00:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
jobs anything
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.789 --> 00:51:54.799 align:start position:0%

00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire insurance premium tax
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
returns and the financial impact of
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
these credits in fiscal year 2023 we
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
generated approximately
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
123.5 million in premium taxes from the
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
licensed insurers
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
licensed insurance companies with a net
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%

premium tax returns were $3.7 million
 
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
which is about 3% of the premium taxes
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
collected or 2.4 of the insurance
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
Department's total net revenue this is
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
introduction if you're
 
00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:51.829 align:start position:0%

00:52:55.789 --> 00:52:55.799 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry yes 98.5% of the 3 $2.7
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
million in credits taken are a direct
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
impact of licensed insurance
 
00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:02.799 align:start position:0%
companies that have filed a business
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax return with the
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
company that companies are allowed to
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
take on their premium tax returns if
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
qualified and that is a business
 
00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax Community Development
 
00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:17.240 align:start position:0%

handouts that you have in front of you
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
for further detail and then we'll be
 
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:25.480 align:start position:0%

have great thank you good morning today
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
we'll begin with the first slide here uh
 
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
to review the credits for the business
 
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
Enterprise taxes filed with the
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue or bet as we often
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
refer to it uh the bet is imposed under
 
00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
RSA 77e and is allowed as a credit
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
against the premium taxes due under RSA
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
400a when a New Hampshire licensed
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
Insurance Company claims this credit on
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
their premium tax report they must Pro
 
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
provide the proper documentation which
 
00:54:03.309 --> 00:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
would be a copy of their prior Year's
 
00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:07.799 align:start position:0%
bet return any credit amount in excess
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
of their premium tax liability can be
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
applied to the company's business
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
profits tax filed with the Department of
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue therefore there's no carry
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
forwards of these credits to subsequent
 
00:54:21.309 --> 00:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
premium tax
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
returns you'll see in the last four
 
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
years the credits taken have ranged
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
between 2.8 million and roughly 3.7
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
Million last fiscal year 141 companies
 
00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
took this credit and where we collected
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
close to 1,300 premium tax returns this
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
accounts for close to 11% of the
 
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
credit on the next you'll see a
 
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
flowchart illustrating how this bet
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
credit is applied so first when the
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
insurance company files and pays their
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax with the
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue and then they submit their
 
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
premium tax filing with us they are
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
reporting their prior year bet payment
 
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:13.240 align:start position:0%
as a credit against their current year's
 
00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.190 align:start position:0%
as a credit against their current year's
tax

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
liability we then review the company's
 
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
prior year bet return and ensure that we
 
00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
have the proper supporting
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
documentation once we've audited did all
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
the BET credits taken we then forward a

four years that for three of those years
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
we only had one company making a
 
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
contribution and taking the credit and
 
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2022 there were three
 
00:58:32.349 --> 00:58:32.359 align:start position:0%

01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
only so in short that's basically life
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
insurance annuities and disability
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
income lines of
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
business the credit is allocated at 20%
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
of the assessment for each of the five
 
01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
calendar years following the year in
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
which the assessment was paid there have
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
not been any of these credits taken in
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
the last four years the last assessment
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
that was assessed that qualified for a
 
01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
tax credit was issued in
 
01:00:29.549 --> 01:00:29.559 align:start position:0%
2013 therefore the first year the
 
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
companies took this credit was on their
 
01:00:34.829 --> 01:00:34.839 align:start position:0%
2014 tax return which is actually filed
 
01:00:34.839 --> 01:00:36.309 align:start position:0%
2014 tax return which is actually filed
in

01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
2015 and since this credit is allocated
 
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
over five years the last of these
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
credits were on the calendar year 2018
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
tax return filed in
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
2019 so just so you have an idea of the
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
impact these credits have had in
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
previous years in fiscal year 2019 there
 
01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
were 181 companies that took this credit
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
amounting to
 
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
376,000 and this was about the average
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
amount that had been taken each year
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.029 --> 01:01:15.039 align:start position:0%
2015 and lastly we have a flowchart of
 
01:01:17.029 --> 01:01:17.039 align:start position:0%
what we just reviewed where the
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
association will issue a Class B
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
assessment for the life annuity or
 
01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
disability income claims file by the
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
policy holders of the
 
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
insolvent in uh insolvent member
 
01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.390 align:start position:0%

insurance

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:33.160 align:start position:0%
company we will verify with the
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
association each year whether any
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
assessments were levied that qualified
 
01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
for the tax credit and the insurance
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
company would pay their assessment
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
invoice and Report the amount of the
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
qualified credit on their tax return
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
also providing a copy of their invoice
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
as supporting
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
documentation so that's a recap and the
 
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
impact of the three credit credits that
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
can be taken on the insurance company's
 
01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
premium tax reports and can I clarify
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
anything or answer
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you for that
 
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
presentation um the on page
 
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
seven I'm a little confused on that
 
01:02:14.109 --> 01:02:14.119 align:start position:0%
because on bullet point three you say
 
01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
the last assessment which qualified for
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
tax credit was issued in
 
01:02:20.829 --> 01:02:20.839 align:start position:0%
2013 but then on the next bullet it says
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
FY 2019 there were 181 companies that
 
01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
took the credit yep because that is
 
01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
allocated over 5 years 20% for 5 years
 
01:02:34.109 --> 01:02:34.119 align:start position:0%
so the very last from the from the
 
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
assessment issued in
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
2013 the last time it was on their tax
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
return was 19 okay so why why is no one
 
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
taking this credit
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
anymore um it's very specific to the
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
lines of business that I mentioned the
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
life insurance the disability income and
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
the annuities not not every Health
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
insurer but the
 
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
member uh insurance companies if they
 
01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
were to go insolvent they have to write
 
01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
just these lines of business so there
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
have been other companies put in
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation or liquidated but they
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
just didn't write the New Hampshire
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
business for those lines I see so these
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
insolvency question I'm I'm gonna go
 
01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:25.240 align:start position:0%
back to page two okay um I just want to
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm clear enough so it lenses
 
01:03:29.789 --> 01:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and people providing
 
01:03:32.829 --> 01:03:32.839 align:start position:0%
Insurance products pay the uh insurance
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
premium tax and what this slide says is
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
that they're allowed to deduct from
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
whatever their tax total obligation is
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
based on the premiums they've they've
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
collected they're allowed to deduct the
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
any bet tax that they paid from their
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
premium tax bill La of better raas and
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
the net of that is what the agency
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
collects right so they can't take a
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
credit of more than their tax liability
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
and anything left over can be applied
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
against their business profits
 
01:04:05.549 --> 01:04:05.559 align:start position:0%
tax with the Department of Revenue so if
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
they I'm sorry so again I'm trying to
 
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
understand a little bit so if the
 
01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
premium tax that they owe and then they
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
subtract out the BET and if they still
 
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
have more like the tax was less than uh
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
the or I should say the tax is more than
 
01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
the bet they can then take it forward to
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
the BPT I'm sorry say again I'm I'm
 
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
trying to understand exactly how that
 
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
cash flow happen
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
um so if their tax liability were
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
100,000 let's say and their bet was
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
50,000 they're still going to owe us
 
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
50,000 okay and if they're some crazy
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
reason their tax liability was 50,000
 
01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
but they paid 100,000 in bet what
 
01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
happens to the other 50 is that just is
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
they can apply it against their business
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
profits tax so we'll send a report of
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
the credits taken on the the premium tax
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
rate returns we'll send a report to the
 
01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue letting them know
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
what was taken okay
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
yeah now does is there a Max on this for
 
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
the at the state level or is it just for
 
01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.230 align:start position:0%
the at the state level or is it just for
the

01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:11.630 align:start position:0%
the
BET

01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:16.269 --> 01:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
um no um well I guess the max would be
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
the absolute Max would be a company's
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
bet and
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
BPT uh just the business Enterprise tax
 
01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
so the business nothing to do with the
 
01:05:27.789 --> 01:05:27.799 align:start position:0%
business profits tax can be taken as a
 
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
credit on the tax return I thought you
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
just said that if if it's greater than
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
the BET then you can apply to the BPT
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
the the leftover bet credit can be
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
applied against the business profits
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
tax right which could potentially for
 
01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
some companies wipe out their bet and
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
BPT depending on the size of the credit
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
the BET could wipe about the BPT is that
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
what you're saying yeah um that would
 
01:06:02.269 --> 01:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
here the well I'm just going back to
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
what Senator Lang asked so if the credit
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
is larger than the BET owed you said
 
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
then the balance could be applied
 
01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
against the BPT correct so I'm just
 
01:06:17.069 --> 01:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
saying there may be some instances where
 
01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
a company May wipe out both there bet
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
and BPT I suppose yeah that's a
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
potential probably not likely year
 
01:06:25.269 --> 01:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
because then they're going to Wi out of
 
01:06:25.279 --> 01:06:29.510 align:start position:0%
because then they're going to Wi out of
business

01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.430 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
questions um and so in general um does
 
01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
this seem like an effective program or
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
are there issues that you see that
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
solved um no we haven't since I've been
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
there we haven't had the the life and
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
health assessment credits taken um
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
currently only one with the
 
01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.190 align:start position:0%
currently only one with the
cdfa

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
cdfa
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah we don't for us it's more about
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
information sharing okay yeah yeah so at
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
this point you wouldn't recom anything
 
01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
be changed about
 
01:07:29.309 --> 01:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
this no okay
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
time sounds good it's sounds like your
 
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh interface with Dr has improved with
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
maybe as a result of better technology
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
better software and so forth yes
 
01:07:41.839 --> 01:07:45.990 align:start position:0%
better software and so forth yes
definitely

01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
yeah all right thank you very much for
 
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
coming thank you so much have a great
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.920 --> 01:08:00.710 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
all right we are on wrap up now we've
 
01:08:05.309 --> 01:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
heard all the
 
01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
presentations thank you all for
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
coming um I guess we need to talk about
 
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
next steps here because um we do have a
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
report that is due on November
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
1st um
 
01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
and I guess this commission continues or
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
not commission joint committee continues
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
past that point um I guess what we we've
 
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
reviewed the five areas that we wanted
 
01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.510 align:start position:0%
reviewed the five areas that we wanted
to

01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh for this for this report which was
 
01:08:42.829 --> 01:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
the new investment tax credit the
 
01:08:42.839 --> 01:08:43.990 align:start position:0%
the new investment tax credit the
economic

01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
economic
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
revitalization uh the Coos job County uh
 
01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
job creation um the insurance premium
 
01:08:54.669 --> 01:08:54.679 align:start position:0%
tax credit and the um
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward so we've done those
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
we've done those five now um what do we
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
see as next steps so my recommendation
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair is why don't we walk through
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
those five see what our recommendations
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
are for those five I can then draft the
 
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
our report that be great um for us what
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
it might look like based on our
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations after the review um and
 
01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:17.799 align:start position:0%
then next meeting we can potentially
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
look at voting on that what what were
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
the five cdfa erz Coos County insurance
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
premium tax credit and the credit carry
 
01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:28.269 align:start position:0%
premium tax credit and the credit carry
forward

01:09:28.269 --> 01:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
liabilities okay if you look at the
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
agenda from today you yeah easy SAR see
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.829 --> 01:09:44.839 align:start position:0%
prior tax expenditure committee report
 
01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
that Patrick abramy
 
01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
did um identified the children's
 
01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund as a program that had
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
been incompletely reviewed and it was
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
listed as a program that needed to be
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
reviewed so I I and it's too we're not
 
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
going to do that before November one
 
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
okay excuse me um but I think I'd like
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
to see flagged in the report you draft
 
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
that we're going to look at that um in
 
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
this coming
 
01:10:21.229 --> 01:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
year and that was called what the child
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
the child scholarship children that's
 
01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
the that's the EFA and um low income
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship program that we education
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
tax credit programs is technically what
 
01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:39.430 align:start position:0%
tax credit programs is technically what
it's

01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
called does that make sense to you so
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
the I so the recommendation on that
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
would just be that in the next meeting
 
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
that whoever takes up this manle which
 
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
be us again I don't know if it's due
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
next year I think it's us if it's an
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
every year thing it's an every year
 
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
thing yeah so next year November number
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
one we've got to write another one yeah
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
and so we'll just say that we our point
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
is to take that one up let's commit to
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
do it doing it it's obviously a big
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
program it's also a controversial
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
program as we all know um and so it
 
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
merits uh uh a careful look so
 
01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations on the five right so
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
cdfa are we going to take up their Rec
 
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
their request of increasing the actual
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
available credits up to $5 million with
 
01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
a total investment of
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
7.2 is our recommendation to do that do
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
we think that's in best interest of
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
communities in the state um or do we
 
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
just make no recommendation and that the
 
01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
current program is working well and
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
serving our communities that's a good
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
question it's clearly a very good
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
program right and uh I think each of us
 
01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
has has seen it play out um I know I
 
01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:53.560 align:start position:0%
have um in a good way and uh um it's
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
clearly um unable to fully meet the
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
um presumably do as well with some
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
increment as it's done thus far and uh
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
so the only question is sort of
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
budgeting and I think you put it into
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
the hopper so I would I guess I would
 
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
endorse uh the
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
modest increment that uh well is it 50%
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
increment I guess so it's pretty big or
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
30% something like that yeah on the
 
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
investment side it'll be a little over
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
be like 40% right going from 5 to seven
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
yeah right so roughly 40% increase in in
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
available Investments with a
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
corresponding credit increase to go with
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
it I think what they would like would be
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
to go to $10 million um one of these
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
components um but but what sort of made
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
sense in terms of numbers that are being
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
batted about was go up to $5 million for
 
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
the tax credit which means the money
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
they get is that much greater goes to 7
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
million something right yeah I think
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
that incremental change makes sense and
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
then you know it'll get reviewed again
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
to see um is it you know how's it doing
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
should it be increased further yeah um I
 
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
think they would love it if we doubled
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
it but I think U exactly going to the
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
seven I think this a good good step and
 
01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
uh how does how does this work so we
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
make this recommendation who are we
 
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
making it too I mean is again some's got
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
to pick it up yeah someone's someone's
 
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
got to decide to put a bill in right but
 
01:13:41.229 --> 01:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
we're past filing periods right so it's
 
01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
kind of an irrelevant for this year um
 
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't mean that next next term
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
that someone will pick it up right yeah
 
01:13:49.229 --> 01:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
so somebody could just look or somebody
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
could amend a bill somehow and put it in
 
01:13:53.709 --> 01:13:53.719 align:start position:0%
but it would be it would be sitting
 
01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
there in our report as something that
 
01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
somebody could point to and use okay if
 
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
I remember right the report goes
 
01:14:06.629 --> 01:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
to you know all the typical people right
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
the speaker the president the clerk um
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
the Senate Clerk and Governor yeah so
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
all right so cdfa I think we're we're
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
going to say it's working well the
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
communities in the state are being well
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
served by the by the uh by the credit
 
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
and that our recommendation is to
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
increase the available tax credit up to
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
the full $5 million allowing donations
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
to incre increase accordingly yeah right
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
yep we good with that yeah but I guess
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
we have to state that it's we have to
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
set a number like 7 million is the new
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
yeah 7.2 they indicated so allow tax
 
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
credits up to $5 million which would
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
increase donations up to $7.2 million
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
right y just a matter ofe the the number
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
that's specified in the statute is the
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
tax credit number or do they have that
 
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
well that's why I asked that question
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's Their donation cap so we increased
 
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
the donation cap to 7.2 which will
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
result in $5 million in tax credits
 
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
right got it and is the state so what is
 
01:15:08.189 --> 01:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
the state giving oh no it's a tax credit
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's a credit so a business
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
again private businesses donate to um
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
the organization and they're able to
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
take that off their business profits tax
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
as as a charitable donation means that
 
01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:18.390 align:start position:0%
as as a charitable donation means that
the

01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
state effectively gets get 75% $1
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
something million Less in terms of
 
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue okay yeah no that sounds good
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
okay second one was um the
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
erz right so on the erz we just heard
 
01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.310 align:start position:0%
erz right so on the erz we just heard
that

01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
today again over sub subscribe program
 
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
if I remember right yeah I think that's
 
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
right um it's a cap at 825,000
 
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
um people are getting only 37
 
01:15:55.080 --> 01:16:12.830 align:start position:0%
um people are getting only 37
.4%

01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
alone I think I agree what's up I think
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
I agree I mean look look at how it's
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
decreasing though so so
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
pration right the pration decreases
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
because of the investment increasing
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
right so again this is the one where
 
01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
um someone let me make sure although
 
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
what's interesting is in 2019 2.4
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
million was requested so at 2022 we
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
still were less than that Max yeah maybe
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
we do just leave it for
 
01:16:55.629 --> 01:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
now remember the
 
01:16:57.870 --> 01:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean obviously it's still over
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
subscribed it was oversubscribed in
 
01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:07.270 align:start position:0%
subscribed it was oversubscribed in
2019

01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
um so my my toughest point on this
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
conversation is I don't know how much
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
$750 moves the needle for an employer
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
whether he's going to add a position or
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
not it gets to my my question yeah I
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
mean I just don't know that it's really
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
an effective tool right for the money it
 
01:17:23.629 --> 01:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
is I mean I know as when I was an
 
01:17:25.470 --> 01:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
employer and 22 employees I don't know
 
01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
that I would have hired somebody just
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
because someone's going to give me an
 
01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:28.189 align:start position:0%
because someone's going to give me an
extra

01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
extra
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
$750 to put on a $40,000 $50,000 job
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
right so I don't know that it's there's
 
01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
a great um while there's increased
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
demand for it I don't know that there's
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
Great Value that's a good point I
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to lose it but I wouldn't
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
want to add to it either yeah because
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't there be demand I mean if
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
somebody can take it they'll take it but
 
01:17:50.669 --> 01:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
I think to your point they're already
 
01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
planning on hiring something right yeah
 
01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I'll be honest one those
 
01:17:57.149 --> 01:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
maybe something that sort of adds to the
 
01:18:02.669 --> 01:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
buzz around uh um an area that the
 
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
community wants to stimulate and
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
encourage development and so this is one
 
01:18:14.669 --> 01:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
of those things that is an incentive to
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
that creates a buzz around doing that
 
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
but I don't know that's just a guess to
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
me this is okay this is sort of like the
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
ER R&amp;D tax corre
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know that it creates any new
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
jobs that's another one that's very
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
small yeah right but it but it's a check
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
box one thing I've heard Ways and Means
 
01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
and all the years in the house was
 
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
there's always a check boox do you have
 
01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
an R&amp;D tax credit yes we do and I check
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
the box off and it makes the state
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
attractive to somebody because we have a
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
credit that's what I meant by Buzz you
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
know the same so I I my my
 
01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
and so I'm just going to put in a report
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
it's working it's over subscribed but
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
there's no recommendation for changing
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
exactly should we say we don't believe
 
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to um result in increased
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
hiring or I I don't think we jump into
 
01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
the deep end of that pool right because
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
that becomes a political argument we're
 
01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
just going to make no recommendation to
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
change okay that's my opinion yeah no
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
you're probably right because as soon as
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
we once you say it's not creating jobs
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
and people starts another fight right so
 
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
yeah all right so next was was um the
 
01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
Coos County job creation
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
credit the same discussion
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
really just one
 
01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
County but it is a poor
 
01:19:39.070 --> 01:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
County well there's no limits on that
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
one so it's true there's really nothing
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
to change right now the only time we
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
would change that would be to put a
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
limit because it's yeah if it was being
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
over if we were paying a huge amount you
 
01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
know a huge i' leave it be yeah so we
 
01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
next one is this insurance premium tax
 
01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
credit just a logical thing I don't I
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
don't really understand the last piece
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
that she was talking about so that's
 
01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
tring so if you remember right I was
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
trying to remember this so insurance
 
01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
companies pay I I don't think it's any
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
different than businesses right a normal
 
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
business but it's weird and that the
 
01:20:19.709 --> 01:20:19.719 align:start position:0%
insurance companies pay the insurance
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
premium tax credit and they're allowed
 
01:20:25.629 --> 01:20:25.639 align:start position:0%
to D doct the BET their payroll tax from
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
their liability on the tax credit right
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
um because they're already paying you
 
01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
know it's kind of a weird mix right so I
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
don't quite get it myself but um I don't
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
know that we have a reason to change it
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
right I definitely leave it be it's sort
 
01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
of uh it's sort of like avoiding double
 
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
taxation I that's the idea that's the
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
way I looked at
 
01:20:51.629 --> 01:20:51.639 align:start position:0%
it and and to my the answer to my
 
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
question about what changes recommend
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
they said none so I think given that we
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
don't feel any and they aren't asking
 
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
for any yeah so the last one is the big
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
one the credit carryover yeah right and
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
the big numbers and big budget impact
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
for recommendation
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
um no I guess my concern is I was I was
 
01:21:12.669 --> 01:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
almost questioning whether we should
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
spread that out a little further to
 
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
lessen the impact to the state as a
 
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation instead of getting hit so
 
01:21:24.189 --> 01:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
hard so fast interesting question yeah
 
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:25.639 align:start position:0%
or whether we leave it just it is and
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
take the hit you know what you could do
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
is um flag it um say that
 
01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.350 align:start position:0%
is um flag it um say that
uh

01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
we we're concerned about the impact of
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
um uh we'll we'll be reviewing that and
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
making recommendations on it during this
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
next year
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
because we can't do that right now you
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
know I don't think we know no question
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
is whether we recommend it for somebody
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
else to pick up next year right because
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
the next impact is 2027 yeah right
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
that's when is that well
 
01:22:07.629 --> 01:22:07.639 align:start position:0%
2025 I don't know how that review is
 
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
going to happen I guess a Ways and Means
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
Committee would look at it yeah I mean
 
01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
or maybe we could recommend the Dr
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
um identify options that
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
might might uh spread out the impact is
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
that what we're talking about yeah
 
01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
spreading out the impact so it doesn't
 
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
hit the budget so hard so we could
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
recommend that yeah that's I was that's
 
01:22:32.669 --> 01:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
was my suggestion was whether I I my
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be to do that right
 
01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
because you're taking a pretty hefty hit
 
01:22:38.669 --> 01:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
especially when you get that at 100%
 
01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
right is that we're taking a $61 million
 
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
hit to the budget potentially and
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
remember that this is also any taxpayer
 
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
can always request a refund at any time
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
of their credit so this is a forced
 
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
refund that we're requiring
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
so um so all we're saying is we're not
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
going to force the refund process we'd
 
01:22:58.430 --> 01:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation we spread that
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
forced refund out a little further to
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
lesson to to create a Glide slope rather
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
than a cliff for the T for the budget so
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
my recommendation would be that Dr
 
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
undertake a review of this and
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
make and identify legislation that would
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
be needed to spread out the impact in a
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable way I don't know something
 
01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
like that is that is that the idea yeah
 
01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'm most concerned from 2026 if
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
I look at this table 2026 and on because
 
01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:30.280 align:start position:0%
you can see 22 million 33 on the high
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
side 22 million 33 million 41 million 61
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
million we can probably absorb 2024 we
 
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
have a a a decent rainy day fund right
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
now I mean I think if that gets bigger
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
than we think um I'm not too worried
 
01:23:45.870 --> 01:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
about 23 you know 23 and 24 are likely
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
to be much at
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
the closer to the leftand side number
 
01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
the low number than right yeah right
 
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
hand side number although because we
 
01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
don't know so why am I saying that I
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
don't well yeah we don't know but but it
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
looks like it the worrisome time starts
 
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
from 2026 yeah I hear you so I'm like I
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
I was just breaking it up into fums
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
right budget when budgets are going to
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
hit right so you're looking at 27 and 28
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
right even on the low side we're looking
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
at a $23 million tax hit at the low side
 
01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
in that in that banum to a $74 million
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
hit on the high side so you know some
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
significant dollars for a budget hit and
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
so again maybe spreading that out you
 
01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
know jumping from going from 250 maybe
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
we we change it to a you know 50%
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
decrement for a few de bi enums to get
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
down to 100% rather than um a full 250
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
straight to 100 so uh this would be a
 
01:24:48.189 --> 01:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
report to uh the uh two- ways of means
 
01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
committees and finance committees yeah
 
01:24:53.109 --> 01:24:53.119 align:start position:0%
well and it goes to the
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
there's a whole L the speaker and so
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
forth that too would make sure they get
 
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
committees I once and the the nice thing
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
is once we get to 250 which we will in
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
25 at least we're we're we're halfway
 
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
there I 500 that's the other point with
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
the this overhang that people worry
 
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
about has been less the risk is is
 
01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
diminished right 500 is is huge if that
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know suddenly hit all at once
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
so so the recommendation committee is
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
there concern about the starting in 2025
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact to the state on such a
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh dramatic change and consider have Dr
 
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
and to in legislature consider expanding
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
that law to go for a longer time period
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
at a smaller reduction yeah to ease the
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
impact on the budget yeah and should we
 
01:25:55.229 --> 01:25:55.239 align:start position:0%
suggest Poss 50 basis point um you know
 
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
250 to 200 to 150 right do it over each
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
bium until get done I wish make a
 
01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
suggestion is okay so the suggestion is
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
um 50% reduction going from 250 to 200
 
01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
and 1 bym and then go from 200 to 150
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
and the next BM and then down to 100% in
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
the third so it spreads it out over six
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
years rather than over two sounds good
 
01:26:21.199 --> 01:26:23.030 align:start position:0%
years rather than over two sounds good
yeah

01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:26:24.990 --> 01:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
would it making legislation were that
 
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
this easy what's that would it making
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
legislation in fact were this easy yeah
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
anything else yes so what we what two
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
things one is um you just said once you
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
write the report we need a meeting to
 
01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
approve it I think we don't need a
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
meeting we can do we just sign off on it
 
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
if everybody we sign off the problem is
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
if we want changes to it we got to be
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
careful about sending emails around
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
because then we start dealing with 91a
 
01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
issues that's a good
 
01:26:55.709 --> 01:26:55.719 align:start position:0%
right so um I can write it and draft it
 
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
and then you can determine if we need a
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
meeting um individually you can each
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
send me as long as you don't include the
 
01:27:03.149 --> 01:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
whole team I think that's right we can
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
do it that way yeah individually you can
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
say Tim I'd like to amend this and then
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
I can make the Amendments and adjust
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
should be able to pull this off unless
 
01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
you really mess up and give
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
us I mean the two that aren't here I I
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't know that they're going to have
 
01:27:19.950 --> 01:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
any major oh yeah we have three of them
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
we have no recommendations where systems
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
great yeah right so there's no
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations we only have
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation on cdfa and credit carry
 
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
over yeah um so right I mean because
 
01:27:34.109 --> 01:27:34.119 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to Lou so okay the other thing
 
01:27:37.510 --> 01:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at is just uh time you know
 
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
just time left right for the November so
 
01:27:44.109 --> 01:27:44.119 align:start position:0%
to make sure so today's the 20th um we
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
would have to have a
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
meeting you have to submit it on the
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
first is that has to be signed and
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
submitted by the first again I'll write
 
01:27:54.030 --> 01:27:54.040 align:start position:0%
it up and then we'll see where it goes
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
only I'll ask I I'll blind copy
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
everybody so that anybody has a reply
 
01:27:59.870 --> 01:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
all we don't get the whole committee um
 
01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
right and I'll just blind copy everybody
 
01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
and then I'll just s ask for suggestions
 
01:28:06.030 --> 01:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
and changes and then I'll adapt and if I
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
ruin school with it I'll get it typed up
 
01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
and sent for everyone's signature and
 
01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
maybe each of you need you need to
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
process with um FR yeah and I'll talk to
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
l l so that we minimize any yeah yeah
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
potential ises
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay I don't think there'll be any
 
01:28:31.229 --> 01:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
problem but no because we don't have
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
time and my to my point is today's the
 
01:28:36.669 --> 01:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
20th if by I don't know the 25th or 26th
 
01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:39.719 align:start position:0%
we I'll try to have to by Monday right
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
so you can start that process of editing
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
now we don't have to actually this
 
01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to go into the calendar if
 
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
we have another meeting it doesn't have
 
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
to go on the counter because it's a
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
joint it's a joint yeah still has to
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
committee well there was something weird
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
where when I scheduled I forget what it
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
was the fir this is our second meeting
 
01:28:59.790 --> 01:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
when I scheduled the first one it didn't
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
go in the calendar and Jennifer said it
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to it's a joint it's a
 
01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:07.400 align:start position:0%
joint committee so that's weird yeah so
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
in theory if we had to we could you know
 
01:29:12.109 --> 01:29:12.119 align:start position:0%
but if I'm remembering that correctly
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure that's what one way or
 
01:29:15.310 --> 01:29:15.320 align:start position:0%
the other we can have that meeting if we
 
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
have I'll draft it afid a signature
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
sheet you just got to show up at
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere in sign whatever office I can
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
leave it my office my secretary just pop
 
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
in and sign off everybody signature
 
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
that's a v a yes vote to the ring well
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
we're all going to be around next week
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
on Thursday right I'm be here Wednesday
 
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
veto day right oh yeah we're gonna be
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
here on 26 V yeah so I'll have it by
 
01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
then I'll I'll get it out to you by the
 
01:29:46.350 --> 01:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
by Monday the draft report request your
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
input for changes um and then I'll bring
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
it the 26th so
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
sounds good we need to set date for
 
01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:58.830 align:start position:0%
sounds good we need to set date for
another

01:29:58.830 --> 01:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
meeting what because what's our next
 
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
it's just to vote Yes but like I said I
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
think we can just do that with your no
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
but you're talking about next year the
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
the next 12 months I I suggest we try to
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
do something in
 
01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
January um possibly February but uh and
 
01:30:20.109 --> 01:30:20.119 align:start position:0%
I I'd suggest do the CH children's
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
all right so we don't we we can just
 
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
email back and forth kind of set a DAT
 
01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
for that next meeting I think again J I
 
01:30:37.149 --> 01:30:37.159 align:start position:0%
know that so busy they're pushing us to
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
like we want I don't know how we're
 
01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
going to do it but they want bills heard
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
the first week of January like we
 
01:30:45.310 --> 01:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
haven't introduced him yet technically
 
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
how do we schedule hearing but they're
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
getting us to try to jump because we
 
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
know what we're going to be do you guys
 
01:30:53.229 --> 01:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
are going to th
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
bills you have 800 plus plus 200 rained
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
rained you guys have ton of and we're
 
01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
going to get stuck with all those I
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of those 220
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
retained on January the first meeting in
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
January going be sent to the Senate and
 
01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to deal with what
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
happens when we pass house bills how do
 
01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:13.430 align:start position:0%
happens when we pass house bills how do
they

01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
go so are you talking about um well just
 
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
in general so we have well we have the
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
same process you do right so once you
 
01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
send us a b can we scheduled public
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
hearing we have everything else that's
 
01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
right so we still but the the only
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
question we're gonna have is like so so
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
112 is a good good example senville 112
 
01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
we've already passed it right I was just
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
asking I I don't remember ever having
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
Committee of conferences in the second
 
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
year but apparently you
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
must right so you're gonna on January
 
01:31:45.550 --> 01:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
whatever day we meet you're gonna vote
 
01:31:49.629 --> 01:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
on 112 right all of the retained bills
 
01:31:51.070 --> 01:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
if it's a Senate bill it means it's got
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
to come back for concurrence or a non-c
 
01:31:55.149 --> 01:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
concurrence right if it's a house bill
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
we'll just take up our first public
 
01:31:57.709 --> 01:31:57.719 align:start position:0%
hearing on it right and treat it as a
 
01:32:00.189 --> 01:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
new bill um like like a second year
 
01:32:02.669 --> 01:32:02.679 align:start position:0%
crossover bill or first year crossover
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
bill so um so that's all I know that
